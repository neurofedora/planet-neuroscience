              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21964">NeuroLIP: Interpretable and Fair Cross-Modal Alignment of fMRI and Phenotypic Text</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity data with phenotypic textual descriptors (e.g., disease label, demographic data) holds significant potential to advance our understanding of neurological conditions. However, existing cross-modal alignment methods often lack interpretability and risk introducing biases by encoding sensitive attributes together with diagnostic-related features. In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature. Our work advances the development of transparent and equitable neuroimaging AI.

                arXiv:2406.03044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability. Code is available at https://github.com/czlwang/PopulationTransformer.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21796">Meta-Representational Predictive Coding: Biomimetic Self-Supervised Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21793">Input-Triggered Hardware Trojan Attack on Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering unique advantages in terms of low power consumption. However, the security aspect of SNNs is under-explored compared to their ANN counterparts. As the increasing reliance on AI systems comes with unique security risks and challenges, understanding the vulnerabilities and threat landscape is essential as neuromorphic computing matures. In this effort, we propose a novel input-triggered Hardware Trojan (HT) attack for SNNs. The HT mechanism is condensed in the area of one neuron. The trigger mechanism is an input message crafted in the spiking domain such that a selected neuron produces a malicious spike train that is not met in normal settings. This spike train triggers a malicious modification in the neuron that forces it to saturate, firing permanently and failing to recover to its resting state even when the input activity stops. The excessive spikes pollute the network and produce misleading decisions. We propose a methodology to select an appropriate neuron and to generate the input pattern that triggers the HT payload. The attack is illustrated by simulation on three popular benchmarks in the neuromorphic community. We also propose a hardware implementation for an analog spiking neuron and a digital SNN accelerator, demonstrating that the HT has a negligible area and power footprint and, thereby, can easily evade detection.

                arXiv:2503.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores an approach to constructing energy landscapes of a formal neuron and multilayer artificial neural networks (ANNs). Their analysis makes it possible to determine the conceptual limitations of both classification ANNs (e.g., MLP or CNN) and generative ANN models. The study of informational and thermodynamic entropy in formal neuron and ANN models leads to the conclusion about the energetic nature of informational entropy. The application of the Gibbs free energy concept allows representing the output information of ANNs as the structured part of enthalpy. Modeling ANNs as energy systems makes it possible to interpret the structure of their internal energy as an internal model of the external world, which self-organizes based on the interaction of the system's internal energy components. The control of the self-organization and evolution process of this model is carried out through an energy function (analogous to the Lyapunov function) based on reduction operators. This makes it possible to introduce a new approach to constructing self-organizing and evolutionary ANNs with direct learning, which does not require additional external algorithms. The presented research makes it possible to formulate a formal definition of information in terms of the interaction processes between the internal and external energy of the system.

                arXiv:2503.21795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient spatial navigation is a hallmark of the mammalian brain, inspiring the development of neuromorphic systems that mimic biological principles. Despite progress, implementing key operations like back-tracing and handling ambiguity in bio-inspired spiking neural networks remains an open challenge. This work proposes a mechanism for activity back-tracing in arbitrary, uni-directional spiking neuron graphs. We extend the existing replay mechanism of the spiking hierarchical temporal memory (S-HTM) by our spike timing-dependent threshold adaptation (STDTA), which enables us to perform path planning in networks of spiking neurons. We further present an ambiguity dependent threshold adaptation (ADTA) for identifying places in an environment with less ambiguity, enhancing the localization estimate of an agent. Combined, these methods enable efficient identification of the shortest path to an unambiguous target. Our experiments show that a network trained on sequences reliably computes shortest paths with fewer replays than the steps required to reach the target. We further show that we can identify places with reduced ambiguity in multiple, similar environments. These contributions advance the practical application of biologically inspired sequential learning algorithms like the S-HTM towards neuromorphic localization and navigation.

                arXiv:2503.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative Co-evolution, through the decomposition of the problem space, is a primary approach for solving large-scale global optimization problems. Typically, when the subspaces are disjoint, the algorithms demonstrate significantly both effectiveness and efficiency compared to non-decomposition algorithms. However, the presence of overlapping variables complicates the decomposition process and adversely affects the performance of cooperative co-evolution. In this study, we propose a novel two-phase cooperative co-evolution framework to address large-scale global optimization problems with complex overlapping. An effective method for decomposing overlapping problems, grounded in their mathematical properties, is embedded within the framework. Additionally, a customizable benchmark for overlapping problems is introduced to extend existing benchmarks and facilitate experimentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithm instantiated within our framework significantly outperforms existing algorithms. The results reveal the characteristics of overlapping problems and highlight the differing strengths of cooperative co-evolution and non-decomposition algorithms. Our work is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/GMC-DRL/HCC.

                arXiv:2503.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49%, and significantly reduces search time, most notably offering a 98x speedup over SNASNet and running 30% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.

                arXiv:2503.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In expensive multi-objective optimization, where the evaluation budget is strictly limited, selecting promising candidate solutions for expensive fitness evaluations is critical for accelerating convergence and improving algorithmic performance. However, designing an optimization strategy that effectively balances convergence, diversity, and distribution remains a challenge. To tackle this issue, we propose a composite indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (CI-EMO) for expensive multi-objective optimization. In each generation of the optimization process, CI-EMO first employs NSGA-III to explore the solution space based on fitness values predicted by surrogate models, generating a candidate population. Subsequently, we design a novel composite performance indicator to guide the selection of candidates for real fitness evaluation. This indicator simultaneously considers convergence, diversity, and distribution to improve the efficiency of identifying promising candidate solutions, which significantly improves algorithm performance. The composite indicator-based candidate selection strategy is easy to achieve and computes efficiency. Component analysis experiments confirm the effectiveness of each element in the composite performance indicator. Comparative experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms five state-of-the-art expensive multi-objective optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2503.21984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimizing real-valued objective functions defined on the Grassmann manifold Gr}(k,n), the space of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of R^n. While existing optimization techniques on Gr}(k,n) predominantly rely on first- or second-order Riemannian methods, these inherently local methods often struggle with nonconvex or multimodal landscapes. To address this limitation, we adapt the Differential Evolution algorithm - a global, population based optimization method - to operate effectively on the Grassmannian. Our approach incorporates adaptive control parameter schemes, and introduces a projection mechanism that maps trial vectors onto the manifold via QR decomposition. The resulting algorithm maintains feasibility with respect to the manifold structure while enabling exploration beyond local neighborhoods. This framework provides a flexible and geometry-aware alternative to classical Riemannian optimization methods and is well-suited to applications in machine learning, signal processing, and low-rank matrix recovery where subspace representations play a central role. We test the methodology on a number of examples of optimization problems on Grassmann manifolds.

Abstract: The research presented in this paper advances the integration of Hebbian learning into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, systematically exploring different architectures to build an optimal configuration, adhering to biological tenability. Hebbian learning operates on local unsupervised neural information to form feature representations, providing an alternative to the popular but arguably biologically implausible and computationally intensive backpropagation learning algorithm. The suggested optimal architecture significantly enhances recent research aimed at integrating Hebbian learning with competition mechanisms and CNNs, expanding their representational capabilities by incorporating hard Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition, Gaussian lateral inhibition mechanisms, and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule in a single model. Mean accuracy classification measures during the last half of test epochs on CIFAR-10 revealed that the resulting optimal model matched its end-to-end backpropagation variant with 75.2% each, critically surpassing the state-of-the-art hard-WTA performance in CNNs of the same network depth (64.6%) by 10.6%. It also achieved competitive performance on MNIST (98%) and STL-10 (69.5%). Moreover, results showed clear indications of sparse hierarchical learning through increasingly complex and abstract receptive fields. In summary, our implementation enhances both the performance and the generalisability of the learnt representations and constitutes a crucial step towards more biologically realistic artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2411.04728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have shown that embedding a small payload within each spike exchanged between spiking neurons can enhance inference accuracy without increasing energy consumption. To scale neuromorphic computing to larger workloads, split computing - where an SNN is partitioned across two devices - is a promising solution. In such architectures, the device hosting the initial layers must transmit information about the spikes generated by its output neurons to the second device. This establishes a trade-off between the benefits of multi-level spikes, which carry additional payload information, and the communication resources required for transmitting extra bits between devices. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of a neuromorphic wireless split computing architecture that employs multi-level SNNs. We propose digital and analog modulation schemes for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to enable efficient communication. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios reveal performance improvements achieved by multi-level SNN models and provide insights into the optimal payload size as a function of the connection quality between the transmitter and receiver.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91579">Respiratory and cardiac interoceptive sensitivity in the first two years of life</a></h4>

              
                Several recent theoretical accounts have posited that interoception, the perception of internal bodily signals, plays a vital role in early human development. Yet, empirical evidence of cardiac interoceptive sensitivity in infants to date has been mixed. Furthermore, existing evidence does not go beyond the perception of cardiac signals and focuses only on the age of 5–7 mo, limiting the generalizability of the results. Here, we used a modified version of the cardiac interoceptive sensitivity paradigm introduced by Maister et al., 2017 in 3-, 9-, and 18-mo-old infants using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. Going beyond, we introduce a novel experimental paradigm, namely the iBREATH, to investigate respiratory interoceptive sensitivity in infants. Overall, for cardiac interoceptive sensitivity (<i>total n</i>=135) we find rather stable evidence across ages with infants on average preferring stimuli presented synchronously to their heartbeat. For respiratory interoceptive sensitivity (<i>total n</i>=120) our results show a similar pattern in the first year of life, but not at 18 mo. We did not observe a strong relationship between cardiac and respiratory interoceptive sensitivity at 3 and 9 mo but found some evidence for a relationship at 18 mo. We validated our results using specification curve- and mega-analytic approaches. By examining early cardiac and respiratory interoceptive processing, we provide evidence that infants are sensitive to their interoceptive signals.

">Oligodendrocyte precursor cells establish regulatory contacts with the soma of active neurons</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can generate myelinating oligodendrocytes life-long, a process that is dependent on neuronal activity. However, it is possible that OPCs have additional functions, influencing neuronal functions directly. We have used a mouse genetic model of juvenile seizures and chemical induction of neuronal activity to examine the morphological and molecular changes in OPCs around activated principal neurons. We found an increase in process extension of OPCs specifically toward the soma of activated neurons. Moreover, we found that the close proximity of OPC processes around neurons expressing the immediate early gene c-Fos decreased the calcium transients in these neurons, indicating a regulative function of OPCs. Analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility revealed significant changes in genes involved in transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) signaling. Extracellular matrix genes, particularly those encoding type VI collagen, an established binding partner for the OPC surface protein NG2, was increased around active neurons. Our findings indicate that OPCs are an integral part of the neural network and may help to decrease the activity of neurons that have previously been over-excited, in order to protect these neurons.

">Rapid changes in cholinergic signaling, myelination and thyroid signaling pathway gene expression in amygdala subnuclei in response to social status maintenance and reorganization</a></h4>

              
                Male CD-1 mice form linear social hierarchies and can rapidly reform them following social reorganization. Through Tag-based sequencing in the medial amygdala (MeA), we identified several genes regulating cholinergic signaling, myelination, and thyroid signaling that rapidly shift expression 70 minutes after animals change social status. Here, we further characterize the expression patterns of individual genes within these pathways in both stable and reorganized hierarchies. We find that genes related to cholinergic signaling show higher expression in the MeA of dominant males in stable hierarchies as well as when reestablishing dominance in reorganized hierarchies. Dominant males also show higher levels of myelination related genes than socially descending males when reestablishing their social status during social reorganization but less so in stable groups. Conversely, thyroid signaling genes show higher expression in the MeA in subordinate males and previously dominant males who are socially descending. Using RNAscope, we were able to demonstrate broadly similar patterns of gene expression immediately following social reorganization across the MeA, basolateral, and central amygdala for 7 genes of interest (chat, slc5a7, ache, mbp, mog, crym, mybpc1). High levels of co-expression of cholinergic signaling and myelination gene expression in dominant males suggest that these processes work together to promote resilience to the social challenge and promote dominance. In summary, we demonstrate that rapid changes in amygdala gene expression in each pathway are associated with the formation and maintenance of dominance and subordinate social status in stable and reorganized environments.

">Discovery, Interruption, and Updating of Auditory Regularities in Memory: Evidence from Low-Frequency Brain Dynamics in Human MEG</a></h4>

              
                During passive listening, the brain maintains a hierarchy of predictive models to monitor the statistics of its surroundings. The automatic discovery of regular patterns has been associated with a gradual increase in sustained tonic M/EEG activity, sourced in auditory, hippocampal, and frontal areas - reflecting evidence accumulation and establishment of a regularity model. Conversely, when a regular pattern is interrupted, the sustained activity drops - indicating disengagement from the model. However, how such models are established in and retrieved from memory as well as the conditions under which they are activated and interrupted remain underexplored. In this MEG experiment (N=26; both sexes), we examined how neural responses related to model establishment and interruption are influenced by (1) the rate of stimulus presentation (tone presentation rate 20 Hz vs. 40 Hz), and (2) the novelty of the experienced acoustic structure (novel vs resumed REG pattern). The results show that (1) the dynamics of model interruption and establishment are independent of stimulus presentation rate, and that (2) model establishment occurred much faster when an experienced vs novel pattern was presented after pattern interruption, suggesting re-activation of the stored original model. These responses broadly mirrored those of an ideal observer model of prediction. (3) Finally, sustained response rises in response to pattern establishment and interruption were localized in auditory, hippocampal, and frontal sources, supporting top-down model information flow. These results unveil the temporal dynamics and neural network underlying the brain's construction and selection of predictive models to monitor changes in sensory statistics.

">Rare mutations implicate CGE interneurons as a vulnerable axis of cognitive deficits across psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) share genetic risk factors, including rare high penetrance single nucleotide variants and copy number variants (CNVs), and exhibit both overlapping and distinct clinical phenotypes. Cognitive deficits and intellectual disability-critical predictors of long-term outcomes-are common to both conditions. To investigate shared and disorder-specific neurobiological impact of highly penetrant rare mutations in ASD and SCZ, we analyzed human single-nucleus whole-brain sequencing data to identify strongly affected brain cell types. Our analysis revealed Caudal Ganglionic Eminence (CGE)-derived GABAergic interneurons as a critical nexus for cognitive deficits across these disorders. Notably, genes within 22q11.2 deletions, known to confer a high risk of SCZ, ASD, and cognitive impairment, showed a strong expression bias toward vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing cells (VIP+) among CGE subtypes. To explore VIP+ GABAergic interneuron perturbations in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in vivo, we examined their activity in the Df(16)A+/- mouse model during a spatial navigation task and observed reduced activity along with altered responses to random rewards. At the population level, VIP+ interneurons exhibited impaired spatial encoding and diminished subtype-specific activity suggesting deficient disinhibition in CA1 microcircuits in the hippocampus, a region essential for learning and memory. Overall, these results demonstrate the crucial role of CGE-derived interneurons in mediating cognitive processes that are disrupted across a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Pre-amyloid cognitive intervention preserves brain function in aged TgF344-AD rats, maintaining connectivity and enhancing plasticity in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, with cognitive reserve playing a key role in mitigating disease impact. Cognitive stimulation has been suggested as a non-pharmacological approach to enhance cognitive reserve and delay cognitive deterioration, but its underlying mechanism remains to be fully understood. This study investigates the effects of pre-amyloid cognitive intervention on brain connectivity, memory, synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation in aged TgF344-AD rats, considering sex-specific differences. Methods: Male and female TgF344-AD and wild-type rats were assigned to trained and untrained groups, with cognitive stimulation administered through repetitive delayed nonmatch-to-sample tasks. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions assessed training-induced changes in whole-brain functional connectomics and in particular entorhinal cortex connectivity. Memory was evaluated using the novel object recognition test. Cellular analysis of neurons (NeuN+, Parvalbumin+) and microglial cells, as well as molecular (PSD95, TrkB, p-RPS6, and VGLUT) analyses were conducted to determine the role of cognitive stimulation in modulating neuronal density, neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. Results: Male TgF344-AD rats undergoing prolonged cognitive stimulation had preserved global functional connectivity and exhibited improved recognition memory, compared to untrained animals, while TgF344-AD females did not follow this pattern. Entorhinal cortex connectivity was significantly loss in 19-month-old rats compared to wild-type rats and this was completely prevented by training. At a cellular level, cognitive stimulation significantly decreased the number of PV+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of trained rats. Moreover, a greater microglial density around beta amyloid plaques and a less reactive phenotype was clearly observed at 11 in trained rats. These protective effects diminished by 19 months, coinciding with increased neuroinflammation and microglial dysfunction. At a molecular level, cognitive stimulation preserved PSD95 expression in male TgF344-AD and p-RPS6 in both sexes. Conclusions: Pre-amyloid cognitive stimulation enhances synaptic plasticity, sustains brain network integrity, and modulates neuroinflammation, contributing to increased resilience against Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline. In general, cognitive stimulation exerted a more protective effect in male TgF344-AD rats showing sex-dependent differences in pathology and cognitive reserve mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of early cognitive engagement as a potential strategy to delay disease onset and underscore sex-specific differences in cognitive resilience mechanisms.

">Increased white matter microglial reaction and perivascular macrophages in the aging microcebe primate</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. They play crucial roles in maintaining brain homeostasis, yet their involvement in aging remains not fully understood. While age-related microglia changes have been strongly characterized in rodents, studies in non-human primates are scarce. HLA-DR is a major histocompatibility class II cell surface receptor which presents antigens to cell of the immune response. It is a major marker of microglia reaction. In this study, we explored microglia in the brain of a non-human primate (mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)) using HLA-DR immunolabeling. We analyzed microglial morphology and quantified HLA-DR+ cell density and protein expression in middle-aged and old animals. A wide range of microglial morphologies was observed in the white matter, including thin processes microglia, rod-like elongated and polarized shape, hypertrophic, and amoeboid microglia. Aging was associated with a region-specific regulation of microglia as increased HLA-DR+ microglial expression was found in the white matter while very few HLA-DR+ microglia were observed in the parenchyma of cortical gray matter regions. A second finding of the study was the higher number of HLA-DR+ perivascular macrophages in old animals. Although further studies are required to investigate the cause of these age-related changes, this study is critical as it describes for the first time the microglial and perivascular macrophage status in microcebus murinus primate that is widely used as a model for cerebral aging and to investigate age-related neurodegenerative processes.

">An extracellular complex between CLE-1/collagen XV/XVIII and Punctin/MADD-4 defines cholinergic synapse identity</a></h4>

              
                The precise localization of postsynaptic receptors opposite neurotransmitter release sites is essential for synaptic function. This alignment relies on adhesion molecules, intracellular scaffolds, and a growing class of extracellular scaffolding proteins. However, how these secreted proteins are retained at synapses remains unclear. We addressed this question using C. elegans neuromuscular junctions, where Punctin, a conserved extracellular synaptic organizer, positions postsynaptic receptors. We identified CLE-1, the ortholog of collagens XV/XVIII, as a key stabilizer of Punctin. Punctin and CLE-1B, the main isoform present at neuromuscular junctions, form a complex and rely on each other for synaptic localization. Punctin undergoes cleavage, and in the absence of CLE-1, specific fragments are lost, resulting in the mislocalization of cholinergic receptors to GABAergic synapses. Additionally, CLE-1 regulates receptor levels independently of Punctin. These findings highlight a crucial extracellular complex that maintains synapse identity.

">Whole-brain, all-optical interrogation of neuronal dynamics underlying gut interoception in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Internal signals from the body and external signals from the environment are processed by brain-wide circuits to guide behavior. However, the complete brain-wide circuit activity underlying interoception - the perception of bodily signals - and its interactions with sensorimotor circuits remain unclear due to technical barriers to accessing whole-brain activity at the cellular level during organ physiology perturbations. We developed an all-optical system for whole-brain neuronal imaging in behaving larval zebrafish during optical uncaging of gut-targeted nutrients and visuo-motor stimulation. Widespread neural activity throughout the brain encoded nutrient delivery, unfolding on multiple timescales across many specific peripheral and central regions. Evoked activity depended on delivery location and occurred with amino acids and D-glucose, but not L-glucose. Many gut-sensitive neurons also responded to swimming and visual stimuli, with brainstem areas primarily integrating gut and motor signals and midbrain regions integrating gut and visual signals. This platform links body-brain communication studies to brain-wide neural computation in awake, behaving vertebrates.

">Single-cell characterization of the human C2 dorsal root ganglion recovered from C1-2 arthrodesis surgery: implications for neck pain</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) receive and transmit sensory information from the tissues they innervate and from the external environment. Upper cervical (C1-C2) DRGs are functionally unique as they receive input from the neck, head, and occipital cranial dura, the latter two of which are also innervated by the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The C2 DRG also plays an important role in neck pain, a common and disabling disorder that is poorly understood. Advanced transcriptomic approaches have significantly improved our ability to characterize RNA expression patterns at single-cell resolution in the DRG and TG, but no previous studies have characterized the C2 DRG. Our aim was to use single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic approaches to create a molecular map of C2 DRGs from patients undergoing arthrodesis surgery with ganglionectomy. Patients with acute (<3 months) or chronic ([&ge;]3 months) neck pain were enrolled and completed patient-reported outcomes and quantitative sensory testing prior to surgery. C2 DRGs were characterized with bulk, single nucleus, and spatial RNA sequencing technologies from 22 patients. Through a comparative analysis to published datasets of the lumbar DRG and TG, neuronal clusters identified in both TG and DRG were identified in the C2 DRG. Therefore, our study definitively characterizes the molecular composition of human C2 neurons and establishes their similarity with unique characteristics of subsets of TG neurons. We identified differentially expressed genes in endothelial, fibroblast and myelinating Schwann cells associated with chronic pain, including FGFBP2, C8orf34 and EFNA1 which have been identified in previous genome and transcriptome wide association studies (GWAS/TWAS). Our work establishes an atlas of the human C2 DRG and identifies altered gene expression patterns associated with chronic neck pain. This work establishes a foundation for the exploration of painful disorders in humans affecting the cervical spine.

">Material Damage to Multielectrode Arrays after Electrolytic Lesioning is in the Noise</a></h4>

              
                The quality of stable long-term recordings from chronically implanted electrode arrays is essential for experimental neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. This work uses scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to image and analyze eight 96-channel Utah arrays previously implanted in motor cortical regions of four subjects (subject H = 2242 days implanted, F = 1875, U = 2680, C = 594), providing important contributions to a growing body of long-term implant research leveraging this imaging technology. Four of these arrays have been used in electrolytic lesioning experiments (H = 10 lesions, F = 1, U = 4, C = 1), a novel electrolytic perturbation technique using small direct currents. In addition to surveying physical damage, such as biological debris and material deterioration, this work also analyzes whether electrolytic lesioning created damage beyond what is typical for these arrays. Each electrode was scored in six damage categories, identified from the literature: abnormal debris, metal coating cracks, silicon tip breakage, parylene C delamination, parylene C cracks, and shank fracture. This analysis confirms previous results that observed damage on explanted arrays is more severe on the outer-edge electrodes versus inner electrodes. These findings also indicate that are no statistically significant differences between the damage observed on normal electrodes versus electrodes used for electrolytic lesioning. This work provides evidence that electrolytic lesioning does not significantly affect the quality of chronically implanted electrode arrays and can be a useful tool in understanding perturbations to neural systems. Finally, this work also includes the largest collection of single-electrode SEM images for previously implanted multielectrode Utah arrays, spanning eleven different intact arrays and one broken array. As the clinical relevance of chronically implanted electrodes with single-neuron resolution continues to grow, these images may be used to provide the foundation for a larger public database and inform further electrode design and analyses.

">A Sensitive Period for the Development of Temporally Coherent Visual Cortical Processing in Humans: Evidence from Sight Recovery Following Congenital Cataracts</a></h4>

              
                Typical cortical development requires early sensory experience. In humans who had suffered from a transient period of blindness due to dense bilateral congenital cataracts (CC), multiple investigations of cortical activation strength have suggested that extrastriate visual regions are especially vulnerable to aberrant early postnatal visual input. Yet, to date, how early experience might sculpt the temporal stability of human visual cortical processing has not been investigated. In CC individuals, we previously found a persistent and replicable reduction of the earliest event-related marker of extrastriate processing, the P1 wave. Here, we report that this robust reduction of the P1 in CC individuals results from an attenuated temporal coherence of cortical oscillations across trials, rather than from a generally reduced extrastriate cortical activation strength. In two experiments, compared to matched normally sighted controls, CC individuals (n = 12 and 13, respectively) exhibited diminished oscillatory phase coherence (i.e., higher temporal variability), rather than lower oscillatory amplitudes during visual processing. Furthermore, phase coherence information, but not activation strength, allowed classifying sight recovery individuals with congenital vs. developmental etiologies. Finally, exchanging the signal phase and activation strength information between CC and matched control individuals confirmed that group differences in P1 amplitude were largely driven by oscillatory timing. These group differences, specific to the CC group, were not found in groups of sight-recovery individuals who had suffered from developmental cataracts. Our results indicate that the intricate temporal orchestration of visual processing in human extrastriate cortex requires visual experience in an early postnatal sensitive period.

">Goal-directed visual information processing with GABAergic inhibition in parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed visual information processing involves tracking relevant visual signals (targets) over space and time. However, goal-irrelevant visual signals (distractors) can interfere with the tracking of targets. The neuronal mechanisms, which promote the tracking of targets in the challenge of interference from distractors remain elusive. Here, we used time-resolved functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) to measure dynamic changes of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chief inhibitory neurotransmitter, and glutamate, a chief excitatory neurotransmitter, in the parietal and visual cortices while participants performed a visual tracking task for targets among distractors. We found that the more targets had to be tracked, the greater the concentrations of GABA and glutamate in parietal cortex. In visual cortex only the concentration of glutamate increased with the number of tracking targets. Concentration changes of GABA and glutamate in parietal cortex only were differentially associated with performance: Better target tracking was associated with greater increase in GABA concentration and smaller increase in glutamate concentration. These results suggest that GABAergic inhibition in parietal cortex plays a crucial role in minimizing interference during target tracking over space and time, thereby promoting goal-directed visual information processing.

">Progressive remote memory decline coincides with parvalbumin interneuron hyperexcitability and enhanced inhibition of cortical engram cells in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) initially show temporally-graded retrograde amnesia, which gradually progresses into more severe retrograde amnesia. Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD.

">Characterizing Complex Upper Limb Movements with and without Visual Feedback in Typically Developing Children</a></h4>

              
                The development of upper limb movements has been primarily described through reaching movements, which may not have the complex motor planning and execution demands of many daily tasks. In this study, we introduced a complex task in which individuals had to navigate their hand from a start target through two openings in a simple maze to reach an end target. In half the trials, participants received visual feedback of their hand position, and in half of the trials they did not. Thirty-one participants ages 8 to 17 years completed the study. We found that with visual feedback, reaction time, number of speed peaks, movement time, and hand path length all decreased with age. Number of speed peaks, movement time, and hand path length were all increased without visual feedback, however, the impact of removing visual feedback was greatest on the younger children and decreased with age. Our results demonstrate that complex upper limb movements are refined across childhood and adolescence, with a decreasing reliance on visual feedback likely due to increasing feedforward control and improved ability to use proprioceptive feedback. This task can be applied to clinical populations such as cerebral palsy to assess impairments in motor planning and execution as well as determine how proprioceptive impairments contribute to complex movements.

">Polygenic Associations between Motor Behaviour, Neuromotor Traits, and Active Music Engagement in Four Cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic investigations have shown that actively engaging with music, i.e., playing a musical instrument or singing may be protective of motor decline in aging. For example, music training associated with enhanced sensorimotor skills accompanied by changes in brain structure and function. Although it is possible that the benefits of active music engagement "transfer" to benefits in the motor domain, it is also possible that the genetic architecture of motor behaviour and the motor system structure may influence active music engagement. This study investigated whether polygenic scores (PGS) for five behavioural motor traits, 12 neuromotor structural brain traits, and seven rates of change in brain structure traits trained from existing discovery genomewide association studies (GWAS) predict active music engagement outcomes in four independent cohorts of unrelated individuals of European ancestry: the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA; N=22,198), Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS; N=4,605), Vanderbilts BioVU Repository (BioVU; N=6,150), and Vanderbilts Online Musicality study (OM; N=1,559). Results were meta-analyzed for each PGS main effect across outcomes and cohorts, revealing that PGS for a faster walking pace was associated with higher amounts of active music engagement. Within CLSA, a higher PGS for walking pace was associated with greater odds of engaging with music. Findings suggest a shared genetic architecture between motor function and active music engagement. Future intervention-based research should consider the genetic underpinnings of motor behavior when evaluating the effects of music engagement on motor function across the lifespan.

">Dissecting the cortical stages of invariant word recognition</a></h4>

              
                Fluent reading requires the brain to precisely encode the positions of letters within words, distinguishing for instance FORM and FROM across variations in size, position, and font. While early visual areas are known to encode retinotopic positions, how these representations transform into invariant neural codes remains unclear. Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured linguistic representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.

">Temporal and Spatial Scales of Resting-state Human Cortical Activity Throughout Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor and cognitive abilities undergo substantial changes throughout the human lifespan, but the corresponding changes in the functional properties of cortical networks remain poorly understood. This can be studied using temporal and spatial scales of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, which provide a robust description of the topological structure and temporal dynamics of neural activity. For example, timescales of resting-state fMRI signals can parsimoniously predict a significant amount of the individual variability in functional connectivity networks identified in adult human brains. In the present study, we quantified and compared temporal and spatial scales in resting-state fMRI data collected from 2,352 subjects between the ages of 5 and 100 in Developmental, Young Adult, and Aging datasets from Human Connectome Project. For most cortical regions, we found that both temporal and spatial scales largely decreased with age across most cortical areas throughout the lifespan, with the visual cortex and the limbic network consistently showing the largest and smallest scales, respectively. For some prefrontal regions, however, these two scales displayed non-monotonic trajectories during adolescence and peaked around the same time during adolescence and decreased throughout the rest of the lifespan. We also found that cortical myelination increased monotonically throughout the lifespan, and its rate of change was significantly correlated with the changes in both temporal and spatial scales across different cortical regions in adulthood. These findings suggest that temporal and spatial scales in fMRI signals, as well as cortical myelination, are closely coordinated during both development and aging.

">Computational Mechanisms of Temporal Anticipation in Perception and Action</a></h4>

              
                To interact effectively with our surroundings, we rely on strategies to reduce uncertainty. One important source of information is temporal regularities, which enable us to form predictions about when events will occur, and through this, prepare for them in advance. Such preparation was shown to facilitate motor planning, yet the impact of temporal anticipation on perceptual acuity is unknown, and the cognitive computations underlying this process remain debated. To answer these questions, we administered a new difficult change discrimination task with variable anticipatory periods (N=142). We show that both perceptual sensitivity and motor responses are influenced by temporal structure. Using computational modelling, we show that the cognitive operation underlying this behavior is based on a logarithmic transformation of the event hazard rate (HR) and reveal a crucial role of temporal-estimation noise in shaping this computation, both when temporal information is encoded, and when it is decoded. Together, our results highlight the fundamental contribution of anticipation in directing behavior and advance our understanding of temporal processing in the brain.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early midlife bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with greater Alzheimer's disease risk compared to spontaneous/natural menopause. Previously, we found that participants with BSO had lower volume in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 2/3 composite subfield (DG-CA2/3). We sought to extend those hippocampal subfield findings by assessing whether BSO affected volumes along the anteroposterior hippocampal axis, anterolateral entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex subregions (Brodmann area (BA) 35 and 36). We also correlated volumes with key demographic and wellbeing-related factors (age, depressive mood, education), hormone therapy characteristics, and recognition memory performance. Early midlife participants with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy (ET)) and age-matched control participants with intact ovaries (AMC) completed high-resolution T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medial temporal lobe volumes and Remember-Know task recognition memory performance were compared between groups—BSO (<i>n</i> = 23), BSO + ET (<i>n</i> = 28), AMC (<i>n</i> = 34) using univariate analyses. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses were used to examine how volumes related to demographic and wellbeing-related factors, as well as hormone therapy characteristics. Relative to BSO + ET, BSO had lower posterior hippocampal and DG-CA2/3 volumes but greater perirhinal BA 36 volumes. Compared to age, depressive mood, and education, ET was the strongest positive predictor of hippocampal volumes and negative predictor of perirhinal BA 36 volumes. For BSO + ET, hippocampal volumes were negatively related to ET duration and positively related to concurrent progestogen therapy. Relative to AMC, BSO had greater anterolateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal BA 35 and BA 36 volumes. BSO groups (with and without ET) relied more on familiarity than recollection for successful recognition memory. BSO and ET may have distinct effects on medial temporal lobe volumes, with potential implications for memory processes affected by Alzheimer's disease risk.</p>

                Koley et al. indicate that fatty acid oxidation occurs concomitantly with fatty acid biosynthesis in multiple plant tissues, including seeds that are thought to stably house storage reserves. This study suggests that some lipid breakdown and fatty acid oxidation is the rule and not the exception in plant metabolism.

">Familial ALS/FTD-associated RNA-Binding deficient TDP-43 mutants cause neuronal and synaptic dysregulation in vitro</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein constituting the pathological inclusions observed in ~95% of ALS and ~50% of FTD patients. In ALS and FTD, TDP-43 mislocalises to the cytoplasm and forms insoluble, hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates that enhance cytotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration. Despite its primary role as an RNA/DNA-binding protein, how RNA-binding deficiencies contribute to disease onset and progression is little understood. Among many identified familial mutations in TDP-43 causing ALS/FTD, only two mutations cause an RNA-binding deficiency, K181E and K263E. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-in the two disease-linked RNA-binding deficient mutations in SH-SY5Y cells, generating both homozygous and heterozygous versions of the mutant TDP-43 to investigate TDP-43-mediated neuronal disruption. Significant changes were identified in the transcriptomic profiles of these cells, in particular, between K181E homozygous and heterozygous cells, with the most affected genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic pathways. This result was validated in cell studies where the neuronal differentiation efficiency and neurite morphology were compromised in TDP-43 cells compared to unmodified control. Interestingly, divergent neuronal regulation was observed in K181E-TDP-43 homozygous and heterozygous cells, suggesting a more complex signalling network associated with TDP-43 genotypes and expression level which warrants further study. Overall, our data using cell models expressing the ALS/FTD disease-causing RNA-binding deficient TDP-43 mutations at endogenous levels show a robust impact on transcriptomic profiles at the whole gene and transcript isoform level that compromise neuronal differentiation and processing, providing further insights on TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration.

">Single-dose administration of therapeutic divalent siRNA targeting MECP2 prevents lethality for one year in an MECP2 duplication mouse model</a></h4>

              
                MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS) is a rare X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by duplications of the dosage-sensitive methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Developing effective therapies for MDS is particularly challenging due to the variability in MECP2 expression among patients and the potential risk of inducing Rett syndrome through excessive pharmacological intervention. Reducing dosage to optimize silencing levels often compromises durability and necessitates increased dosing frequency. We present here a series of fully chemically modified small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed for both isoform-selective and total MECP2 silencing. Among these, we identify six lead siRNA candidates across two distinct chemical scaffolds, achieving targeted total MECP2 expression reductions ranging from 25% to 75%, sustained for at least four months following a single administration. The efficacy and safety of human ortholog silencing were evaluated using two mouse models with distinct levels of human MECP2 transgene expression. In the severe duplication model, a single dose of the total isoform-silencing siRNA fully rescued early mortality and behavioral impairments. Additionally, we show that the isoform-selective targeting strategy may be safer in mild cases of MDS where exaggerated pharmacology may lead to Rett Syndrome. Overall, this study introduces a series of preclinical candidates with the capacity to address the varying levels of MECP2 duplication encountered in clinical settings. Furthermore, it establishes a target selection strategy that may be applied to other dosage-sensitive gene imbalances.

                Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.

">Deletion of the voltage-gated calcium channel gene, CaV1.3, reduces Purkinje cell dendritic complexity without altering cerebellar-mediated eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variation in CACNA1D, the gene that encodes the pore-forming subunit of the L-type calcium channel CaV1.3, has been associated with increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders that display abnormalities in cerebellar structures. We sought to clarify if deletion of CaV1.3 in mice would induce abnormalities in cerebellar cortex cytoarchitecture or synapse morphology. Since CaV1.3 is highly expressed in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) and L-type channels appear to regulate GABA release from MLIs, we hypothesized that loss of CaV1.3 would alter GABAergic synapses between MLIs and Purkinje cells (PCs) without altering MLI numbers or PC structure. As expected, we did not observe changes in the numbers of MLIs or PCs. Surprisingly, CaV1.3 KO mice do have decreased complexity of PC dendritic arbors without differences in the number or structure of GABAergic synapses onto PCs. Loss of CaV1.3 was not associated with impaired acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning. Therefore, our data suggest that CaV1.3 expression is important for PC structure but does not affect other measures of cerebellar cortex morphology or cerebellar function as assessed by delay eyeblink conditioning.

">The neurocomputational mechanisms of hierarchical linguistic predictions during narrative comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension requires a listener to predict the upcoming inputs of linguistic units with multiple timescales based on previous contexts, but how the prediction process is hierarchically represented and implemented in the human brain remains unclear. Combining the natural language processing (NLP) approach and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in a narrative comprehension task, we first applied the group-based general linear model (gGLM) to identify the neural underpinnings associated with the language prediction on word and sentence. Our results revealed a cortical architecture supporting the prediction, extending from the superior temporal cortices to the regions in the default mode network. Then, we investigated how these adjacent levels interact with each other by testing two rival hypotheses: the continuous updating hypothesis posits that the higher level of the representational hierarchy is continuously updated as inputs unfold over time, while the sparse updating hypothesis states that the higher level is only updated at the end of their preferred timescales of linguistic units. By conducting computational modeling and autocorrelation analysis, we found the sparse model outperformed the continuous model and the updating might occur at the sentence boundaries. Together, our results extend the linguistic prediction from the small timescales such as words to large timescales such as sentences, providing novel insights into the neurocomputational mechanisms of information updating within the linguistic prediction hierarchy.

">Flexible tapping synchronization in macaques: dynamic switching of timing strategies within rhythmic sequences</a></h4>

              
                The ability to synchronize bodily movements with regular auditory rhythm across a broad range of tempos underlies humans' capacity for playing music and dancing. This capability is prevalent across human cultures but relatively uncommon among non-human species. Recent research indicates that monkeys can predictively synchronize to regular, isochronous metronomes, exhibiting a preference for visual rather than auditory sequences. In this study, we trained macaques to perform a visual synchronization tapping task, testing their synchronization abilities over a wide tempo range and characterizing their precision and accuracy in timing intervals throughout rhythmic sequences. Additionally, we investigated whether the macaques employed priors or error correction strategies to maintain synchrony with the metronome. Our findings demonstrate that, following sufficient training, macaques exhibit a remarkable capability to synchronize across diverse tempos. Through an inference model analysis, we identified two distinct timing control strategies used by the macaques: an initial strong regression-to-the-mean effect transitioning dynamically into a more precise error correction approach at their preferred tempo. These results provide compelling evidence that primates possess sophisticated rhythmic timing mechanisms, effectively leveraging internal and external cues to regulate their tapping behavior according to task demands.

">Dissecting the Crosstalk Between Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Systems in the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are neuromodulators implicated in reward processing, decision-making, and motivated behavior. While often viewed as opposing or complementary systems, how DA and 5-HT release are integrated in the striatum remains elusive. Using optogenetics, fiber photometry and slice electrophysiology we found that ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neuron stimulation increased DA release without affecting 5-HT release. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neuron activation, on the other hand, induced serotonin release and a modest, transient increase in DA in the NAc, likely via glutamate co-release onto VTA DA neurons. These findings suggest that DA and 5-HT operate largely independently in the striatum, with selective circuit-dependent interactions. This work refines our understanding of DA-5HT interactions and provides a foundation for future research into their roles in motivated behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Synaptic dysfunction has been implicated as a key mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Most pharmacological therapeutics for schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder temporarily augment chemical synapse function. Nevertheless, medication non-compliance is a major clinical challenge, and behavioral dysfunction often returns following pharmacotherapeutic discontinuation. Here, we deployed a designer electrical synapse to edit a single class of chemical synapses in a genetic mouse model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Editing these synapses in juvenile mice normalized circuit function and prevented the emergence of pathological repetitive behavior in adulthood. Thus, we establish precision circuit editing as a putative strategy for preventative psychotherapeutics.

">Neural correlates in basolateral and central amygdala during reward seeking in the face of punishment</a></h4>

              
                The inability to suppress actions despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of compulsive behaviors and is amygdala dependent. To study the amygdala's role in responding despite adverse consequences, we compared single-unit activity in the basolateral (BLA) or central (CeA) amygdala before and after reward-seeking under punishment threat. Rats started each trial by pressing an initial lever, which triggered an outcome-specific 5-s auditory cue (white noise, pure tone, or clicker), signaling one of three reinforcement conditions: 100% sucrose reward, 20% reward/80% omission, or 80% reward/20% footshock punishment. Next, the active and inactive levers were extended, and pressing on the active lever terminated the auditory cue and triggered an outcome-specific 1-s visual cue predicting either reward, reward omission, or shock. After training, we implanted eight tetrodes in the BLA (n=7) or CeA (n=5) and recorded single-unit activity of ~100 neurons per region during task performance. CeA neurons, and to a lesser extent BLA neurons, responded differently to the distinct auditory cues and outcomes. The discrimination between conditions partially explained the capacity of neuronal activity to predict the latency to lever press to complete the trial. The failure to suppress reward-seeking behavior in the face of punishment coincided with the reactivation of reward-seeking-sensitive and the loss of inhibition of punishment-sensitive neuronal populations. In conclusion, we found that after extended training, opposing populations of activated and inhibited neurons in CeA, and to a lesser extent in BLA, control completion of reward-seeking despite punishment.

">Auditory regulation of hippocampal locomotion circuits by a non-canonical reticular-limbic pathway</a></h4>

              
                The ability to rapidly detect and respond to unexpected auditory stimuli is critical for adaptive behavior, especially during locomotion. Since movement suppresses auditory cortical activity, it remains unclear how salient auditory information influences locomotor circuits. In this work, using in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, chemo- and optogenetics, we investigate the path that relays loud broadband sounds to the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and modulates theta oscillations. We demonstrate that noise accelerates theta frequency and decreases its power, effects mediated by entorhinal cortex (EC) and medial septum (MS) inputs while independent of the primary auditory cortex. Activation of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) neurons projecting to the pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) mimics noise-driven hippocampal responses, supporting a brainstem-limbic auditory processing route. Furthermore, noise selectively modulates CA1 pyramidal neuron and interneuron activity, reflecting diverse circuit dynamics. Finally, loud broadband noise stimulus increased theta coherence between the dHPC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), enhancing interregional synchronization. These results highlight the mechanisms in which the DCN filters behaviorally relevant sounds promoting acoustic motor integration in the hippocampus during locomotion, without direct influence of the auditory cortex.

">Cortical functional connectivity across the adult lifespan and its relation to sensorimotor integration</a></h4>

              
                The operation of the human brain relies on functional networks enabled by inter-areal oscillatory synchronization between neuronal populations. Although disruptions in this functional connectivity are associated with brain disorders, evidence on its healthy age-dependent variation and behavioral relevance remains limited. Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 576 adults, we investigated the evolution of resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) across the healthy adult lifespan. We observed age-related, frequency-specific changes in widespread cortical networks. Alpha-band (8-13 Hz) rs-FC decreased and theta-band (4-8 Hz) rs-FC increased with age, while beta-band (13-30 Hz) rs-FC followed a non-linear trajectory, peaking in middle age. These patterns differed from concurrent changes in oscillatory power, underscoring their dissociable contributions. Notably, reduced beta-band rs-FC was associated with increased sensorimotor attenuation, indicating that changes in rs-FC are behaviorally relevant. These findings advance our understanding of healthy brain aging and highlight a link between resting-state brain activity and sensorimotor integration.

                <p>Neurons adapt to chronic activity changes by modifying synaptic properties, including neurotransmitter release. However, whether neuropeptide release via dense core vesicles (DCVs)&mdash;a distinct regulated secretory pathway&mdash;undergoes similar adaptation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 24&nbsp;h action potential blockade leads to significant DCV accumulation in primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Reactivation with action potential trains induced enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and 700% more DCV exocytosis compared with control neurons. Notably, total DCV cargo protein levels were unchanged, while mRNA levels of corresponding genes were reduced. Blocking neurotransmitter release with Tetanus toxin induced DCV accumulation, similar to that induced by network silencing with TTX. Hence, chronic network silencing triggers increased DCV accumulation due to reduced exocytosis during silencing. These accumulated DCVs can be released upon reactivation resulting in a massive potentiation of DCV exocytosis, possibly contributing to homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background The increasing incidence of emerging infectious diseases is posing serious global threats. Therefore, there is a clear need for developing computational methods that can assist and speed up experimental research to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of microbial infections. Methods In this context, we developed mimicINT, an open-source computational workflow for large-scale protein-protein interaction inference between microbe and human by detecting putative molecular mimicry elements mediating the interaction with host proteins: short linear motifs (SLiMs) and host-like globular domains. mimicINT exploits these putative elements to infer the interaction with human proteins by using known templates of domain-domain and SLiM-domain interaction templates. mimicINT also provides (i) robust Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of SLiM detection which suffers from false positives, and (ii) an interaction specificity filter to account for differences between motif-binding domains of the same family. We have also made mimicINT available via a web server. Results In two use cases, mimicINT can identify potential interfaces in experimentally detected interaction between pathogenic Escherichia coli type-3 secreted effectors and human proteins and infer biologically relevant interactions between Marburg virus and human proteins. Conclusions The mimicINT workflow can be instrumental to better understand the molecular details of microbe-host interactions.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                Background The study investigates the impact of Managerial Ability (MA) on Working Capital Management Efficiency (WCME), focusing on how skilled management influences working capital practices. It also explores the variation in this relationship across firms with different characteristics such as profitability and market valuations within India’s economic landscape. Methods Using a balanced panel dataset of 150 listed companies from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India for the period 2014–2023, the study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). WCME is assessed as a multidimensional efficiency metric incorporating inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cost of goods sold , net revenue, and net income. MA is estimated using a two-step DEA-based approach, separating managerial ability from firm-specific characteristics. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) regression models are applied to examine the individual and interactive effects of MA and Tobin’s Q (TBQ) on WCME along with other important variables. Results The results demonstrate that MA significantly enhances WCME, particularly in firms with lower TBQ. The analysis also reveals that skilled managerial characteristics amplifies the efficiency of working capital management, aligning with the Upper Echelon Theory's (UET) claim that managerial attributes play a critical role in organizational efficiency. Conclusion The study demonstrates managerial ability has a strong influence on corporate working capital policies. This advocates prevalence of certain fundamental concepts such as viz. Upper Echelon Theory (UET), Resource-Based View (RBV), and Agency Theory (AT). From managerial point of view, it is suggested to adopt strategic approaches in practicing WCME that will enhance firm’s competitive advantage and long-term sustainability.

                Background Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the progression of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as chronic pain. It is characterized by elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and TNF-α, by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Emerging research highlights the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in neuroinflammation, proposing cannabinoids as potential therapeutic agents owing to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods This study used an in vitro model, specifically the BV-2 murine microglial cell line, to assess neuroinflammation. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay, and cytokine production was quantified using advanced nanobiosensor technologies, including Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to evaluate protein expression. Microglial cells were treated with varying concentrations of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-SP), cannabidiol (CBD), a full-spectrum tetrahydrocannabinol (FSE-THC) extract (70% THC), or a combination of the two at a 1:1 ratio (FSE-THC/CBD). Results The treatments did not affect BV-2 microglial cell viability. Nitric oxide (NO) production remained unaltered following treatment with Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC 70%, or FSE-THC:CBD in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. However, CBD and FSE-THC:CBD significantly reduced TNF-α levels, whereas Dex-SP and CBD decreased IL-6 expression. Furthermore, Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC (70%), and FSE-THC:CBD modulated the activation of Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α, IFN-γ, NF-κB, and iNOS in concentration- and treatment-specific manners. Conclusions Dex-SPs demonstrate acute anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Specific cannabinoids at particular concentrations exhibit comparable or superior efficacy in modulating key inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in neuroinflammation, and emphasize the need for further investigation to optimize their application.

                The fields of epidemiology and viral phylodynamics share the ultimate goal of disease control, but concepts, methodologies and data employed by each differ in ways that confer complementary strengths and different areas of weakness. We recently introduced EpiFusion, a model for joint inference of outbreak characteristics using phylogenetic and case incidence data via particle filtering and demonstrated its usage to infer the effective reproduction number of simulated and real outbreaks. Here we provide a series of vignettes demonstrating data analysis using the EpiFusion Analysis Framework, consisting of the R package EpiFusionUtilities and the Java program in which the model is implemented, including an example using a new feature incorporated since EpiFusion’s last description: the option to provide a phylogenetic tree posterior as the phylogenetic data input to the program. By outlining these examples, we aim to improve the usability of our model, and promote workflow reproducibility and open research.

                Background Motivational variables are of critical importance concerning students' performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate the interrelationships between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, critical thinking, and academic performance among university students. Methods The participants were 250 students enrolled in university programs in education and psychology. The research instrument was a self-report questionnaire designed to assess intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking, self-regulation, and academic achievement among university students. A path model analysis was employed to identify the relationships among the investigated variables. Results The results demonstrated that self-efficacy was predicted by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking was predicted by self-efficacy, and self-regulation was predicted by self-efficacy and critical thinking, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of self-efficacy. The findings indicate that academic achievement is predicted by critical thinking, and self-regulation, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of these variables in academic contexts. Conclusions The contributions of the present research are twofold, both theoretical and practical. On the one hand, the findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections between motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and self-regulation. On the other hand, they provide valuable insights for developing educational strategies that enhance academic achievement by fostering these key factors.

                <p>by Barry Ryan, Riccardo Marioni, T. Ian Simpson</p>

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Currently, there is no cure for the disease which is in part due to the heterogeneity in patient symptoms, trajectories and manifestations. There is a known genetic component of PD and genomic datasets have helped to uncover some aspects of the disease. Understanding the longitudinal variability of PD is essential as it has been theorised that there are different triggers and underlying disease mechanisms at different points during disease progression. In this paper, we perform longitudinal and cross-sectional experiments to identify which data modalities or combinations of modalities are informative at different time points. We use clinical, genomic, and proteomic data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We validate the importance of flexible data integration by highlighting the varying combinations of data modalities for optimal stratification at different disease stages in idiopathic PD. We show there is a shared signal in the DNAm signatures of participants with a mutation in a causal gene of PD and participants with idiopathic PD. We also show that integration of SNPs and DNAm data modalities has potential for use as an early diagnostic tool for individuals with a genetic cause of PD.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012503">Computational studies reveal structural characterization and novel families of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici effectors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raheel Asghar, Nan Wu, Noman Ali, Yulei Wang, Mahinur Akkaya</p>

Understanding the biological functions of <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) effectors is fundamental for uncovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity and variability, thereby paving the way for developing durable and effective control strategies for stripe rust. However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in <i>Pst</i>, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve <i>Pst</i> races or isolates, a <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> isolate, and one <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between <i>Pst</i> effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on <i>Pst</i> effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of <i>Pst</i> pathogenicity and evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003018">Neural mechanisms for the attention-mediated propagation of conceptual information in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Acunzo, Damiano Grignolio, Clayton Hickey</p>

The visual environment is complicated, and humans and other animals accordingly prioritize some sources of information over others through the deployment of spatial attention. Cognitive theories propose that one core purpose of this is to gather information that can be used in downstream cognitive processes, including the development of concepts and categories. However, neuroscientific investigation has focused closely on the identification of the systems and algorithms that support attentional control or that instantiate the effect of attention on sensation and perception. Much less is known about how attention impacts the acquisition and activation of concepts. Here, we use machine learning of EEG and concurrently recorded EEG/MRI to temporally and anatomically characterize the neural network that abstracts from attended perceptual information to activate and construct semantic and conceptual representations. We find that variance in the amplitude of N2pc—an event-related potential (ERP) component closely linked to selective attention—predicts the emergence of conceptual information in a network including VMPFC, posterior parietal cortex, and anterior insula. This network appears to play a key role in the attention-mediated translation of perceptual information to concepts, semantics, and action plans.

                TDP-43 pathology characterizes neurodegenerative diseases. Scialò et al. use in vitro-generated and patient-derived TDP-43 aggregates as seeds to show that seed-induced TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation causes its loss of function and downstream RNA misregulation. This new cell model shows TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function without overexpression or knockdown.

                Rummens et al. demonstrate that amyloid-like fibrils trigger TDP-43 aggregation and nuclear depletion, key hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. This provokes a unique transcriptomic signature with RNA splicing defects, including disease-specific cryptic splicing in human cells. Over time, fibril-induced TDP-43 pathology recapitulates distinct aggregate shapes and causes toxicity in iPSC-derived neurons.

                Xia et al. identify a mechanism of ovarian cancer resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) that involves arginine methylation of METTL3 by PRMT5, leading to enhanced HR-mediated DSBR. MST4 activates PRMT5 through direct phosphorylation. Inhibition of PRMT5 or METTL3 disrupts HR-DSBR and augments the cytotoxic effects of CDDP in ovarian tumor xenografts.

They find that the stoichiometry of antibody binding is the primary determinant of FcγRIIIa signaling and immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, while epitope location and binding kinetics have minimal impact.

Through in vivo studies, the authors find that PDZD8 functions at neuronal ER-late endosome/lysosome membrane contact sites to promote lysosome maturation and accelerate autophagic flux. Increased autophagy in turn induces activity-dependent synapse formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100478">Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97579">Dimeric R25CPTH(1–34) activates the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor in vitro and stimulates bone formation in osteoporotic female mice</a></h4>

              
                Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone density and strength, increases fracture risk, pain, and limits mobility. Established therapies of parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs effectively promote bone formation and reduce fractures in severe osteoporosis, but their use is limited by potential adverse effects. In the pursuit of safer osteoporosis treatments, we investigated <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, a PTH variant wherein the native arginine at position 25 is substituted by cysteine. These studies were prompted by our finding of high bone mineral density in a hypoparathyroidism patient with the R25C homozygous mutation, and we explored its effects on PTH type-1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in cells and bone metabolism in mice. Our findings indicate that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) forms dimers both intracellularly and extracellularly, and the synthetic dimeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), exhibits altered activity in PTH1R-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) response. Upon a single injection in mice, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) induced acute calcemic and phosphaturic responses comparable to PTH(1–34). Furthermore, repeated daily injections increased calvarial bone thickness in intact mice and improved trabecular and cortical bone parameters in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, akin to PTH(1–34). The overall results reveal a capacity of a dimeric PTH peptide ligand to activate the PTH1R in vitro and in vivo as PTH, suggesting a potential path of therapeutic PTH analog development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105005">Functionally important residues from graph analysis of coevolved dynamic couplings</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between protein dynamics and function is essential for understanding biological processes and developing effective therapeutics. Functional sites within proteins are critical for activities such as substrate binding, catalysis, and structural changes. Existing computational methods for the predictions of functional residues are trained on sequence, structural, and experimental data, but they do not explicitly model the influence of evolution on protein dynamics. This overlooked contribution is essential as it is known that evolution can fine-tune protein dynamics through compensatory mutations either to improve the proteins’ performance or diversify its function while maintaining the same structural scaffold. To model this critical contribution, we introduce DyNoPy, a computational method that combines residue coevolution analysis with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing hidden correlations between functional sites. DyNoPy constructs a graph model of residue–residue interactions, identifies communities of key residue groups, and annotates critical sites based on their roles. By leveraging the concept of coevolved dynamical couplings—residue pairs with critical dynamical interactions that have been preserved during evolution—DyNoPy offers a powerful method for predicting and analysing protein evolution and dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyNoPy on SHV-1 and PDC-3, chromosomally encoded β-lactamases linked to antibiotic resistance, highlighting its potential to inform drug design and address pressing healthcare challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101103">3D reconstruction of neuronal allometry and neuromuscular projections in asexual planarians using expansion tiling light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The intricate coordination of the neural network in planarian growth and regeneration has remained largely unrevealed, partly due to the challenges of imaging the CNS in three dimensions (3D) with high resolution and within a reasonable timeframe. To address this gap in systematic imaging of the CNS in planarians, we adopted high-resolution, nanoscale imaging by combining tissue expansion and tiling light-sheet microscopy, achieving up to fourfold linear expansion. Using an automatic 3D cell segmentation pipeline, we quantitatively profiled neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians during homeostasis and regeneration. We validated previous observations of neuronal cell number changes and muscle fiber distribution. We found that the increase in neuron cell number tends to lag behind the rapid expansion of somatic cells during the later phase of homeostasis. By imaging the planarian with up to 120 nm resolution, we also observed distinct muscle distribution patterns at the anterior and posterior poles. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of <i>β-catenin-1</i> RNAi on muscle fiber distribution at the posterior pole, consistent with changes in anterior-posterior polarity. The glial cells were observed to be close in contact with dorsal-ventral muscle fibers. Finally, we observed disruptions in neural-muscular networks in <i>inr-1</i> RNAi planarians. These findings provide insights into the detailed structure and potential functions of the neural-muscular system in planarians and highlight the accessibility of our imaging tool in unraveling the biological functions underlying their diverse phenotypes and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100527">A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate ‘vectorized’ forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100002">Deciphering the preeclampsia-specific immune microenvironment and the role of pro-inflammatory macrophages at the maternal–fetal interface</a></h4>

              
                Preeclampsia (PE), a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality with highly heterogeneous causes and symptoms, is usually complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, a comprehensive understanding of the immune microenvironment in the placenta of PE and the differences between PE and GDM is still lacking. In this study, cytometry by time of flight indicated that the frequencies of memory-like Th17 cells (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>IL-17A<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>), memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD38<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>−</sup>CD127<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) and pro-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>−</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD38<sup>mid</sup>CD107a<sup>low</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>HLA-DR<sup>mid</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) were increased, while the frequencies of anti-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) and granulocyte myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>low</sup>) were decreased in the placenta of PE compared with that of normal pregnancy (NP), but not in that of GDM or GDM&amp;PE. The pro-inflam Macs were positively correlated with memory-like Th17 cells and memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but negatively correlated with gMDSCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that transferring the F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>−</sup> pro-inflam Macs with a Folr2<sup>+</sup>Ccl7<sup>+</sup>Ccl8<sup>+</sup>C1qa<sup>+</sup>C1qb<sup>+</sup>C1qc<sup>+</sup> phenotype from the uterus of PE mice to normal pregnant mice induced the production of memory-like IL-17a<sup>+</sup>Rora<sup>+</sup>Il1r1<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup>Cxcr6<sup>+</sup>S100a4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells via IGF1–IGF1R, which contributed to the development and recurrence of PE. Pro-inflam Macs also induced the production of memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but inhibited the production of Ly6g<sup>+</sup>S100a8<sup>+</sup>S100a9<sup>+</sup>Retnlg<sup>+</sup>Wfdc21<sup>+</sup> gMDSCs at the maternal–fetal interface, leading to PE-like symptoms in mice. In conclusion, this study revealed the PE-specific immune cell network, which was regulated by pro-inflam Macs, providing new ideas about the pathogenesis of PE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99957">The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time’s cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent’s discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit’s properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time’s apportionment—specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit—which we term the ‘Malapportionment Hypothesis’. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100390">Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range</a></h4>

              
                The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96941">Compositional editing of extracellular matrices by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal stem cell lines</a></h4>

              
                Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECMs), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knock out vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification, and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road toward the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98896">Natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio reveals SR3G as a negative regulator of root suberization and salt resilience in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoots growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <span class="underline">S</span>alt <span class="underline">R</span>oot:shoot <span class="underline">R</span>atio <span class="underline">R</span>egulator <span class="underline">G</span>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <i>SR3G</i> expression is modulated by <i>WRKY75</i> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <i>wrky75</i> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <i>sr3g</i> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of a new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-341/v1?src=rss">Hybrid optimization technique for matrix chain multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computational mathematics and computer science, often encountered in scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning. Traditional MCM optimization techniques use Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization to determine the optimal parenthesization for minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. However, standard matrix multiplication still operates in O(n3) time complexity, leading to inefficiencies for large matrices. Methods In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization technique that integrates Strassen’s algorithm into MCM to further accelerate matrix multiplication. Our approach consists of two key phases: (i) matrix chain order optimization, using a top-down memoized DP approach, we compute the best multiplication sequence, and (ii) hybrid multiplication strategy, we selectively apply Strassen’s algorithm for large matrices (n ≥ 128), reducing the complexity from O(n3) to O(n2.81), while using standard multiplication for smaller matrices to avoid recursive overhead. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid method through computational experiments comparing execution time, memory usage, and numerical accuracy against traditional MCM and Strassen’s standalone multiplication. Results Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method achieves significant speedup (4x–8x improvement) and reduces memory consumption, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This research opens pathways for further optimizations in parallel computing and GPU-accelerated matrix operations. Conclusion This study presents a hybrid approach to Matrix Chain Multiplication by integrating Strassen’s algorithm, reducing execution time and memory usage. By selectively applying Strassen’s method for large matrices, the proposed technique improves efficiency while preserving accuracy. Future work can focus on parallel computing and GPU acceleration for further optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-340/v1?src=rss">Approaches to optimize the unnecessary caesarean section in Bangladesh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother's or the child's health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being "too posh to push", inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh's CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-339/v1?src=rss">Protocol for a study on Iron supplementation and immune responses to maternal vaccination in pregnant women (IRONMUM) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people. Recent evidence has highlighted iron status as a key requirement for effective immune responses. Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women and vaccines are mandated at this stage of life. In the antenatal clinics (ANC) of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thailand-Myanmar border, all pregnant women receive nutritional iron supplements at prophylactic or treatment dosages, as determined by haematocrit. Migrant pregnant women have been offered vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus since 1997, and since April-2022 COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by vaccine history. In this setting, nearly 10% of pregnant women are anaemic at their first ANC visit; approximately 50% of anaemic women receiving treatment doses of nutritional supplements respond by increasing haematocrit after one month of supplementation. Methods This study aimed to investigate whether response to iron supplementation is associated with improved vaccine responses in pregnant women with anemia in this setting. We will monitor three groups of pregnant women vaccinated at their first ANC visit before 28 weeks of gestation receiving nutritional iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplements (Sangobion®, Procter&Gamble): 1) non-anaemic women who receive preventive doses of supplementation, 2) anaemic women who display a haematocrit response to treatment doses, and 3) anaemic women who do not respond to treatment doses. The primary endpoint is the difference in the geometric mean titer ratio (rGMT, comparing baseline to 28 days post-vaccination) of diphtheria-tetanus and COVID vaccine-specific antibodies between anaemic women who respond and those who fail to make a haematocrit response to iron-containing interventions. Discussion Iron deficiency in different populations is associated with poor vaccine efficacy, and nutritional iron supplementation may improve the immune response to vaccines. Interventions that significantly increase vaccine efficacy would represent a major benefit to public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-722/v4?src=rss">Legal aspects and government policy in increasing the role of MSMEs in the Halal ecosystem [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                <p>Stress is a common occurrence for military personnel. This can include the stress of deployment and active combat. Anxiety is considered a reaction to stress, and with anxiety-related disorders on the rise, it is imperative that stress be considered a preexisting condition when studying a number of neurological conditions. To determine the effects of stress on the behavioral outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we used a 3&nbsp;d acute unpredictable stress (AUS) model followed by blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) to assess social anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats. The animals were divided into four groups including unstressed and uninjured control (Con), stress-only animals (AUS), injury-only animals (BINT), and animals that received both stress and injury (AUS + BINT). In the males, behavioral tests such as elevated plus and three-chamber sociability (3-CS) showed that stress plays a dominant role in determining behavioral outcomes after TBI with the AUS + BINT animals behaving more similarly to the AUS animals than the BINT animals. Other tests, such as open field, showed that AUS + BINT had an additive effect on anxiety-like behavior or that prestress could even have a protective effect as seen in three-chamber social novelty (3-CSN). Behavioral assessment of female animals showed that AUS + BINT had the opposite effect than it did on the males in both three-chamber sociability and three-chamber social novelty, while the open field results were similar to the males. This study shows that neurological changes driven by stress have an effect on the behavioral outcomes of BINT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0033-24.2025?rss=1">Characteristics of Spontaneous Anterior-Posterior Oscillation-Frequency Convergences in the Alpha Band</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterior&ndash;posterior interactions in the alpha band (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) have been implicated in various functions including perception, attention, and working memory. The underlying neural communication can be flexibly controlled by adjusting phase relations when activities across anterior&ndash;posterior regions oscillate at a matched frequency. We thus investigated how alpha oscillation frequencies spontaneously converged along anterior&ndash;posterior regions by tracking oscillatory EEG activity while participants rested. As more anterior&ndash;posterior regions (scalp sites) frequency-converged, the probability of additional regions joining the frequency convergence increased, and so did oscillatory synchronization (i.e., oscillatory power) at participating regions, suggesting that anterior&ndash;posterior frequency convergences are driven by inter-regional entrainment. Notably, frequency convergences were accompanied by two types of approximately linear phase gradients, one progressively phase lagged in the anterior direction, the posterior-to-anterior (P-A) gradient, and the other progressively phase lagged in the posterior direction, the anterior-to-posterior (A-P) gradient. These gradients implied traveling waves propagating in the feedforward and feedback directions, respectively. Interestingly, while in natural viewing frequency convergences were accompanied by both gradient types (occurring at different frequencies) regardless of anterior&ndash;posterior routes, when the eyes were closed, the P-A and A-P gradients spatially segregated, channeling feedforward flows of information primarily through the midline and feedback flows primarily through each hemisphere. Future research may investigate how eye closure organizes information flows in this way and how it influences hierarchical information processing. Future research may also investigate the functional roles of frequency-convergence contingent traveling waves in contrast to those generated by other mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Delayed motor development is an early clinical sign of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, changes at the neural circuit level that underlie early motor differences are underexplored. The striatum, the principal input nucleus of the basal ganglia, plays an important role in motor learning in adult animals, and the maturation of the striatal circuit has been associated with the development of early motor behaviors. Here, we briefly exposed pregnant C57BL/6 dams to ethanol (5% w/w) in a liquid diet on embryonic days 13.5&ndash;16.5 and assessed the mouse progeny using a series of nine brief motor behavior tasks on postnatal days 2&ndash;14. Live brain slices were then obtained from behaviorally tested mice for whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp electrophysiology to assess GABAergic/glutamatergic synaptic activity and passive/active properties in two populations of striatal neurons: GABAergic interneurons and spiny striatal projection neurons. Electrophysiologically recorded spiny striatal projection neurons were also filled intracellularly with biocytin for post hoc analysis of dendritic morphology. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in developmental motor delays that were more severe in male mice and coincided with sex-dependent differences in the maturation of striatal neurons. Our findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure results in dynamic morphological and functional changes to the developmental trajectories of striatal neurons commensurate with the development of motor behaviors that differ between male and female mice.</p>

                <p>When attempting to concurrently perform two distinct cognitive tasks, the performance of either task is frequently compromised. This phenomenon is known as dual-task interference. Although multiple task features have been postulated to influence on dual-task interference, the primary determinant remains unclear. The determinant factor causing dual-task interference is an important issue to understand its mechanism and associated functions including switching tasks and planning task order. The present study investigated this issue using monkeys and three behavioral tasks requiring distinct cognitive processes (spatial working memory, SWM; working memory and long-term memory of objects, PA; object working memory, DMS) and manipulating task pair (SWM and PA or SWM and DMS), task order (fixed or randomized), and task difficulty (different delay lengths). The task introduced first showed better performance as compared with the task introduced second, suggesting the task order as an important factor. However, the performance of the SWM task decreased when preceded by the PA and DMS tasks, while the latter tasks were unaffected when the SWM task was introduced first. This tendency was more obvious in random-order conditions than fixed-order conditions. Further, interference effect increased as task difficulty increased. Although the task order is one determinant, our results show the difference in cognitive process needed for tasks, its complexity, and the demand of working memory resources as more significant determinants for deciding the dominant task in dual-task conditions, indicating importance of neural mechanisms including managing working memory resources and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to understand the cause of dual-task interference.</p>

                Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is an exceptionally rare malignancy, often misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to overlapping and non-specific clinical and radiological features. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasingly associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case of a 63-year-old male with chronic HCV infection and F2 hepatic fibrosis who presented with abdominal pain, pruritus, and weight loss. Radiological imaging revealed a pancreatic mass which was subsequently confirmed via histopathological examination to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the initiation of antiviral therapy, the patient succumbed before starting chemotherapy. This case underscores the potential association between HCV infection and PPL, highlighting the importance of early antiviral treatment to prevent severe extrahepatic complications.

                Background During fixed appliance therapy, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial; however, certain mouthwashes can negatively impact orthodontic treatment by altering the mechanical properties of archwires. The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires' Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

                Background Cognitive decline and dementia disproportionately affect Black/African populations in the United States, influenced by lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health disparities. This study examines the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NACC data on 24,476 Black/African adults. Key variables included age, sex, education, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and vascular health markers (hypertension, blood pressure). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum scores. Results The study population had a mean age of 74.5 years, with 74.1% being female. Education levels varied, with 46.84% completing high school and 18.74% attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher. The mean BMI was 29.46 kg/m2, indicating a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, and 77.1% had hypertension, yet only 8.02% were on antihypertensive medication. MMSE scores declined significantly with increasing age (β = -0.09, p < 0.001) and higher depression scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.001), while higher education levels were associated with better cognitive performance (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). Obesity showed a non-linear association, with midlife obesity linked to higher dementia risk but late-life low BMI correlated with frailty and cognitive impairment. Hypertension and elevated systolic blood pressure were weak but significantly associated with cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption (48.77%) and smoking (8%) had mixed effects, with heavy drinking negatively affecting cognition. Conclusion Modifiable risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, depression, and limited educational attainment, significantly influence cognitive outcomes in Black/African populations. Targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and culturally tailored lifestyle modifications could mitigate cognitive decline and dementia risk in this population.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                <p>by Carla M. Kumbale, Qiang Zhang, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants known for their multiple health effects, from skin rashes to liver dysfunction, reproductive toxicity and cancer. While the hazards of dioxins have been well documented, the challenge of developing a comprehensive understanding of the overall health impact of dioxins remains. We propose to address this challenge with a new approach methodology (NAM) consisting of a novel adaptation of the Template-and-Anchor (T&A) modeling paradigm. Generically, the template model is defined as a high-level coarse-grained model capturing the main physiological processes of the system. The variables of this template model are anchor models, which represent component sub-systems in greater detail at lower biological levels. For the case of dioxin, we design the template to capture the systemic effects of dioxin on the body’s handling of cholesterol. Two new anchor models within this template elucidate the effects of dioxin on cholesterol transport in the bloodstream and on sex hormone steroidogenesis and the menstrual cycle. A third anchor model, representing dioxin-mediated effects on cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, had been developed previously. The T&A modeling paradigm enables a holistic evaluation of the impact of toxicants, which in the future may be translated into a powerful tool for comprehensive computational health risk assessments, personalized medicine, and the development of virtual clinical trials.

                <p>by Tianai Wang, Christine Quast, Florian Bönner, Malte Kelm, Tobias Zeus, Teresa Lemainque, Ulrich Steinseifer, Michael Neidlin</p>

Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to alterations of supra-valvular flow patterns which can cause increased damage of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. We investigated these patient specific patterns of a severe AS patient and their reversal in healthy flow through a 4D Flow MRI-based CFD methodology. Computational models of subject-specific aortic geometries were created using in-vivo medical imaging data. Temporally and spatially resolved boundary conditions derived from 4D Flow MRI were implemented for an AS patient and a healthy subject. After validation of the in-silico results with in-vivo data, a healthy inflow profile was set for the AS patient in the CFD model. Pathological versus healthy flow fields were compared regarding their blood flow characteristics, i.e., shear stresses on RBCs and helicity. The accuracy of the 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model was proven with excellent agreement between in-vivo and in-silico velocity fields and R² = 0.9. A pathological high shear stress region in the bulk flow was present during late systole with an increase of 125% compared to both healthy flow. The physiological bihelical structure with predominantly right-handed helices vanished for the pathological state. Instead, a left-handed helix appeared, accompanied by an overall increase in turbulent kinetic energy in areas of accumulated left-handed helicity. The validated 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model identified marked differences between AS and healthy flow. It suggests that altered turbulent and helical structures in the bulk flow are the cause for increased, potentially damaging forces acting upon RBCs in AS.

Soil organisms represent the most abundant and diverse organisms on the planet and support almost every ecosystem function we know, and thus impact our daily lives. Some of these impacts have been well-documented, such as the role of soil organisms in regulating soil fertility and carbon sequestration; processes that have direct implications for essential ecosystem services including food security and climate change mitigation. Moreover, soil biodiversity also plays a critical role in supporting other aspects from One Health—the combined health of humans, animals, and the environment—to the conservation of historic structures such as monuments. Unfortunately, soil biodiversity is also highly vulnerable to a growing number of stressors associated with global environmental change. Understanding how and when soil biodiversity supports these functions, and how it will adapt to changing environmental conditions, is crucial for conserving soils and maintaining soil processes for future generations. In this Essay, we discuss the fundamental importance of soil biodiversity for supporting multiple ecosystem services and One Health, and further highlight essential knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to conserve soil biodiversity for the next generations.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
