              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Transverse myelitis following SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination: a pharmacoepidemiological study in the World Health Organization's database</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse Myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase®, the World Health Organization’s pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the Information Component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Secondly, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase®.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n=364; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.62) and vector-based (n=136; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per one million vaccine doses, the risk-benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>

	<p>After the onset of ischemic stroke, ischemia&amp;amp;ndash;hypoxic cascades cause irreversible neuronal death. Neurons are the fundamental structures of the central nervous system, and mature neurons do not renew or multiply after death. Functional and structural recovery from neurological deficits caused by ischemic attack is a huge task. Hence, there remains a need to replace the lost neurons relying on endogenous neurogenesis or exogenous stem cell-based neuronal differentiation. However, the stem cell source difficulty and the risk of immune rejection of the allogeneic stem cells might hinder the wide clinical application of the above therapy. With the advancement of transdifferentiation induction technology, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes can be converted to neurons through ectopic expression or the knockdown of specific components. The progress and problems of astrocyte transdifferentiation will be discussed in this article.</p>

	<p>Since the hippocampus plays an important role in memory and spatial cognition, the study of spatial computation models inspired by the hippocampus has attracted much attention. This study relies mainly on reward signals for learning environments and planning paths. As reward signals in a complex or large-scale environment attenuate sharply, the spatial cognition and path planning performance of such models will decrease clearly as a result. Aiming to solve this problem, we present a brain-inspired mechanism, a Memory-Replay Mechanism, that is inspired by the reactivation function of place cells in the hippocampus. We classify the path memory according to the reward information and find the overlapping place cells in different categories of path memory to segment and reconstruct the memory to form a &amp;amp;ldquo;virtual path&amp;amp;rdquo;, replaying the memory by associating the reward information. We conducted a series of navigation experiments in a simple environment called a Morris water maze (MWM) and in a complex environment, and we compared our model with a reinforcement learning model and other brain-inspired models. The experimental results show that under the same conditions, our model has a higher rate of environmental exploration and more stable signal transmission, and the average reward obtained under stable conditions was 14.12% higher than RL with random-experience replay. Our model also shows good performance in complex maze environments where signals are easily attenuated. Moreover, the performance of our model at bifurcations is consistent with neurophysiological studies.</p>

	<p>According to DSM 5, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various topics that occupies the majority of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s time for a period of at least six months. The aforementioned state causes distress and/or functional impairments. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluated the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT with an SSRIs intervention program. The participants comprised 16 children and adolescents with GAD (8 males and 8 females) matched with 16 typically developing peers (8 males and 8 females) aged from 10 to 16 years old (M = 12.56 SD = 2.18). Baseline assessment consisted of event related potentials (ERPs), which indicated that participants with GAD presented cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as they exhibited longer P300 latencies. Following treatment with the CBT program and/or medication, children and adolescents with GAD did not present statistically significantly longer P300 latencies and reaction times in comparison to the control group. Lastly, children and adolescents who followed the CBT program or the CBT program with psychopharmacological assistance did not reveal statistically significant differences in 13 out of 15 topographic brain areas and in reaction time.</p>

	<p>The cerebellar region has four times as many brain cells as the brain, but whether the cerebellum functions in cognition, and how it does so, remain unexplored. In order to verify whether the cerebellum is involved in cognition, we chose to investigate whether the cerebellum is involved in the process of error judgment. We designed an experiment in which we could activate the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s error-related potentials (ErrP). We recruited 26 subjects and asked them to wear EEG caps with cerebellar regions designed by us to participate in the experiment so that we could record their EEG activity throughout the experiment. We successfully mitigated the majority of noise interference after a series of pre-processing of the data collected from each subject. Our analysis of the preprocessed data revealed that our experiment successfully activated ErrP, and that the EEG signals, including the cerebellum, were significantly different when subjects made errors compared to when they made correct judgments. We designed a feature extraction method that requires selecting channels with large differences under different classifications, firstly by extracting the time-frequency features of these channels, and then screening these features with sequence backward feature (SBS) selection. We use the extracted features as the input and different event types in EEG data as the labels for multiple classifiers to classify the data in the executive and feedback segments, where the average accuracy for two-class classification of executive segments can reach 80.5%. The major contribution of our study is the discovery of the presence of ErrP in cerebellar regions and the extraction of an effective feature extraction method for EEG data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Leptin Promotes Striatal Dopamine Release via Cholinergic Interneurons and Regionally Distinct Signaling Pathways</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopamine (DA) is a critical regulator of striatal network activity and is essential for motor activation and reward-associated behaviors. Previous work has shown that DA is influenced by the reward value of food, as well as by hormonal factors that reguate food intake and energy expenditure. Changes in striatal DA signaling also have been linked to aberrant eating patterns. Here we test the effect of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in feeding and energy homeostasis regulation, on striatal DA release and uptake. Immunohistochemical evaluation identified leptin receptor (LepR) expression throughout mouse striatum, including on striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and their extensive processes. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), we found that leptin causes a concentration-dependent increase in evoked extra-cellular DA concentration ([DA]<SUB>o</SUB>) in dorsal striatum (dStr) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell in male mouse striatal slices, and also an increase in the rate of DA uptake. Further, we found that leptin increases ChI excitability, and that the enhancing effect of leptin on evoked [DA]<SUB>o</SUB> is lost when nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors are antagonized or when examined in striatal slices from mice lacking ACh synthesis. Evaluation of signaling pathways underlying leptin's action revealed a requirement for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the involvement of different downstream pathways in dStr and NAc core versus NAc shell. These results provide the first evidence for dynamic regulation of DA release and uptake by leptin within brain motor and reward pathways, and highlight the involvement of ChIs in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Given the importance of striatal dopamine (DA) in reward, motivation, motor behavior and food intake, identifying the actions of metabolic hormones on DA release in striatal subregions should provide new insight into factors that influence DA-dependent motivated behaviors. We find that one of these hormones, leptin, boosts striatal DA release through a process involving striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Moreover, we find that the intracellular cascades downstream from leptin receptor (LepR) activation that lead to enhanced DA release differ among striatal subregions. Thus, we not only show that leptin regulates DA release, but also identify characteristics of this process that could be harnessed to alter pathologic eating behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APP Genetic Deficiency Alters Intracellular Ca2+ Homeostasis and Delays Axonal Degeneration in Dorsal Root Ganglion Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The activation of self-destructive cellular programs helps sculpt the nervous system during development, but the molecular mechanisms used are not fully understood. Prior studies have investigated the role of the APP in the developmental degeneration of sensory neurons with contradictory results. In this work, we sought to elucidate the impact of APP deletion in the development of the sensory nervous system <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Our <I>in vivo</I> data show an increase in the number of sciatic nerve axons in adult male and female <I>APP-null</I> mice, consistent with the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the development of peripheral axons. <I>In vitro</I>, we show that genetic deletion of APP delays axonal degeneration triggered by nerve growth factor deprivation, indicating that APP does play a pro-degenerative role. Interestingly, APP depletion does not affect caspase-3 levels but significantly attenuates the rise of axoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs during degeneration. We examined intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms that could be involved and found that <I>APP-null</I> DRG neurons had increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We also observed that DRG axons lacking APP have more mitochondria than their WT counterparts, but these display a lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, we present evidence that APP deficiency causes an increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the developmental degeneration of DRG sensory neurons, and unveil the importance of APP in the regulation of calcium signaling in sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nervous system goes through a phase of pruning and programmed neuronal cell death during development to reach maturity. In such context, the role played by the APP in the peripheral nervous system has been controversial, ranging from pro-survival to pro-degenerative. Here we present evidence <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> supporting the pro-degenerative role of APP, demonstrating the ability of APP to alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mitochondria, critical players of programmed cell death. This work provides a better understanding of the physiological function of APP and its implication in developmental neuronal death in the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Dopamine Receptor 1 Localization to Primary Cilia Impairs Signaling in Striatal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rod-shaped appendage called a primary cilium projects from the soma of most central neurons in the mammalian brain. The importance of cilia within the nervous system is highlighted by the fact that human syndromes linked to primary cilia dysfunction, collectively termed ciliopathies, are associated with numerous neuropathologies, including hyperphagia-induced obesity, neuropsychiatric disorders, and learning and memory deficits. Neuronal cilia are enriched with signaling molecules, including specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream effectors, suggesting that they act as sensory organelles that respond to neuromodulators in the extracellular space. We previously showed that GPCR ciliary localization is disrupted in neurons from mouse models of the ciliopathy Bardet&ndash;Biedl syndrome (BBS). Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mislocalization of ciliary GPCRs may impact receptor signaling and contribute to the BBS phenotypes. Here, we show that disrupting localization of the ciliary GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in male and female mice, either by loss of a BBS protein or loss of the cilium itself, specifically in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons, results in obesity. Interestingly, the weight gain is associated with reduced locomotor activity, rather than increased food intake. Moreover, the loss of a BBS protein or cilia on D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons leads to a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling. Together, these results indicate that cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> activity in the nervous system and underscore the importance of neuronal cilia for proper GPCR signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most mammalian neurons possess solitary appendages called primary cilia. These rod-shaped structures are enriched with signaling proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), suggesting that they respond to neuromodulators. This study examines the consequences of disrupting ciliary localization of the GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons. Remarkably, mice that have either an abnormal accumulation of D<SUB>1</SUB> in cilia or a loss of D<SUB>1</SUB> ciliary localization become obese. In both cases, the obesity is associated with lower locomotor activity rather than overeating. As D<SUB>1</SUB> activation increases locomotor activity, these results are consistent with a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling. Indeed, we found that D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling is reduced in brain slices from both mouse models. Thus, cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spinal Cord Synaptic Plasticity by GlyR{beta} Release from Receptor Fields and Syndapin I-Dependent Uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is key for spinal cord function. Recent observations suggested that by largely elusive mechanisms also glycinergic synapses display synaptic plasticity. We imaged receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracked surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR), and studied differential regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions with the scaffold protein gephyrin and the F-BAR domain protein syndapin I and thereby reveal key principles of this process. S403 phosphorylation of GlyR&beta;, known to be triggered by synaptic signaling, caused a decoupling from gephyrin scaffolds but simultaneously promoted association of syndapin I with GlyR&beta;. In line, kainate treatments used to trigger rearrangements of glycine receptors in murine <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords (mixed sex) showed even more severe receptor field fragmentation than already observed in untreated <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords. Syndapin I deficiency furthermore resulted in more dispersed receptors and increased receptor mobility, also pointing out an important contribution of syndapin I to the organization of GlyR&beta; fields. Strikingly, <I>syndapin I</I> KO also led to a complete disruption of kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization. Accompanying quantitative ultrahigh-resolution studies in dissociated spinal cord neurons proved that the defects in GlyR internalization observed in <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords are neuron-intrinsic defects caused by syndapin I deficiency. Together, our results unveiled important mechanisms organizing and altering glycine receptor fields during both steady state and particularly also as a consequence of kainate-induced synaptic rearrangement - principles organizing and fine-tuning synaptic efficacy and plasticity of glycinergic synapses in the spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Initial observations suggested that also glycinergic synapses, key for spinal cord and brainstem functions, may display some form of synaptic plasticity. Imaging receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracking surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR) and studying regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions, we here reveal key principles of these kainate-inducible adaptations. A switch from gephyrin-mediated receptor scaffolding to syndapin I-mediated GlyR&beta; scaffolding and internalization allows for modulating synaptic receptor availability. In line, kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization was completely disrupted and GlyR&beta; receptor fields were distorted by <I>syndapin I</I> KO. These results unveiled important mechanisms during both steady-state and kainate-induced alterations of synaptic GlyR fields, principles underlying synaptic efficacy and plasticity of synapses in the spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Electrophysiological Validation of Monosynaptic Connectivity between Premotor Interneurons and the aCC Motoneuron in the Drosophila Larval CNS</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to map the synaptic connectivity of entire larval and adult fly neural networks, which is essential for understanding nervous system development and function. So far, the project has produced an impressive amount of electron microscopy data that has facilitated reconstructions of specific synapses, including many in the larval locomotor circuit. While this breakthrough represents a technical tour de force, the data remain underutilized, partly because of a lack of functional validation of reconstructions. Attempts to validate connectivity posited by the connectome project, have mostly relied on behavioral assays and/or GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) or GCaMP imaging. While these techniques are useful, they have limited spatial or temporal resolution. Electrophysiological assays of synaptic connectivity overcome these limitations. Here, we combine patch-clamp recordings with optogenetic stimulation in male and female larvae, to test synaptic connectivity proposed by connectome reconstructions. Specifically, we use multiple driver lines to confirm that several connections between premotor interneurons and the anterior corner cell motoneuron are, as the connectome project suggests, monosynaptic. In contrast, our results also show that conclusions based on GRASP imaging may provide false-positive results regarding connectivity between cells. We also present a novel imaging tool, based on the same technology as our electrophysiology, as a favorable alternative to GRASP imaging. Finally, of eight Gal4 lines tested, five are reliably expressed in the premotor interneurons they are targeted to. Thus, our work highlights the need to confirm functional synaptic connectivity, driver line specificity, and use of appropriate genetic tools to support connectome projects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to provide a complete description of connectivity between neurons in an organism that presents experimental advantages over other models. It has reconstructed hundreds of thousands of synaptic connections of the fly larva by manual identification of anatomic landmarks present in serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volumes of the larval CNS. We use a highly reliable electrophysiological approach to verify these connections, providing useful insight into the accuracy of work based on ssTEM. We also present a novel imaging tool for validating excitatory monosynaptic connections between cells and show that several genetic driver lines designed to target neurons of the larval connectome exhibit nonspecific and/or unreliable expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Clutter Substantially Reduces Selectivity for Peripheral Faces in the Macaque Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>According to a prominent view in neuroscience, visual stimuli are coded by discrete cortical networks that respond preferentially to specific categories, such as faces or objects. However, it remains unclear how these category-selective networks respond when viewing conditions are cluttered, i.e., when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. Here, we asked three questions: (1) Does clutter reduce the response and selectivity for faces as a function of retinal location? (2) Is the preferential response to faces uniform across the visual field? And (3) Does the ventral visual pathway encode information about the location of cluttered faces? We used fMRI to measure the response of the face-selective network in awake, fixating macaques (two female, five male). Across a series of four experiments, we manipulated the presence and absence of clutter, as well as the location of the faces relative to the fovea. We found that clutter reduces the response to peripheral faces. When presented in isolation, without clutter, the selectivity for faces is fairly uniform across the visual field, but, when clutter is present, there is a marked decrease in the selectivity for peripheral faces. We also found no evidence of a contralateral visual field bias when faces were presented in clutter. Nonetheless, multivariate analyses revealed that the location of cluttered faces could be decoded from the multivoxel response of the face-selective network. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that clutter blunts the selectivity of the face-selective network to peripheral faces, although information about their retinal location is retained.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous studies that have measured brain activity in macaques have found visual regions that respond preferentially to faces. Although these regions are thought to be essential for social behavior, their responses have typically been measured while faces were presented in isolation, a situation atypical of the real world. How do these regions respond when faces are presented with other stimuli? We report that, when clutter is present, the preferential response to foveated faces is spared but preferential response to peripheral faces is reduced. Our results indicate that the presence of clutter changes the response of the face-selective network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timing-Dependent Potentiation and Depression of Electrical Synapses Contribute to Network Stability in the Crustacean Cardiac Ganglion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Central pattern generators produce many rhythms necessary for survival (e.g., chewing, breathing, locomotion), and doing so often requires coordination of neurons through electrical synapses. Because even neurons of the same type within a network are often differentially tuned, uniformly applied neuromodulators or toxins can result in uncoordinated activity. In the crab (<I>Cancer borealis</I>) cardiac ganglion, potassium channel blockers and serotonin cause increased depolarization of the five electrically coupled motor neurons as well as loss of the normally completely synchronous activity. Given time, compensation occurs that restores excitability and synchrony. One of the underlying mechanisms of this compensation is an increase in coupling among neurons. However, the salient physiological signal that initiates increased coupling has not been determined. Using male <I>C. borealis</I>, we show that it is the loss of synchronous voltage signals between coupled neurons that is at least partly responsible for plasticity in coupling. Shorter offsets in naturalistic activity across a gap junction enhance coupling, whereas longer delays depress coupling. We also provide evidence on why a desynchronization-specific potentiation or depression of the synapse could ultimately be adaptive through using a hybrid network created by artificially coupling two cardiac ganglia. Specifically, a stray neuron may be brought back in line by increasing coupling if its activity is closer to the remainder of the network. However, if a the activity of a neuron is far outside network parameters, it is detrimental to increase coupling, and therefore depression of the synapse removes a potentially harmful influence on the network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding how neural networks maintain output over years despite environmental and physiological challenges requires understanding the regulatory principles of these networks. Here, we study how cells that are synchronously active at baseline respond to becoming desynchronized. In this system, a loss of synchrony causes different parts of the heart to receive uncoordinated stimulation. We find a calcium-dependent control mechanism that alters the strength of electrical connections between motor neurons. Although others have described similar control mechanisms, here, we demonstrate that voltage changes are sufficient to elicit regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong connections in a sufficiently perturbed network can prevent any neuron from producing its target activity, thus suggesting why the connections are not constitutively as strong as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structural Covariance and Heritability of the Optic Tract and Primary Visual Cortex in Living Human Brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individual differences among human brains exist at many scales, spanning gene expression, white matter tissue properties, and the size and shape of cortical areas. One notable example is an approximately 3-fold range in the size of human primary visual cortex (V1), a much larger range than is found in overall brain size. A previous study (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Andrews et al., 1997</cross-ref>) reported a correlation between optic tract (OT) cross-section area and V1 size in postmortem human brains, suggesting that there may be a common developmental mechanism for multiple components of the visual pathways. We evaluated the relationship between properties of the OT and V1 in a much larger sample of living human brains by analyzing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7 Tesla Retinotopy Dataset (including 107 females and 71 males). This dataset includes retinotopic maps measured with functional MRI (fMRI) and fiber tract data measured with diffusion MRI (dMRI). We found a negative correlation between OT fractional anisotropy (FA) and V1 surface area (<I>r</I> = &ndash;0.19). This correlation, although small, was consistent across multiple dMRI datasets differing in acquisition parameters. Further, we found that both V1 surface area and OT properties were correlated among twins, with higher correlations for monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twins, indicating a high degree of heritability for both properties. Together, these results demonstrate covariation across individuals in properties of the retina (OT) and cortex (V1) and show that each is influenced by genetic factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The size of human primary visual cortex (V1) has large interindividual differences. These differences do not scale with overall brain size. A previous postmortem study reported a correlation between the size of the human optic tract (OT) and V1. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the OT and V1 in living humans by analyzing a neuroimaging dataset that included functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. We found a small, but robust correlation between OT tissue properties and V1 size, supporting the existence of structural covariance between the OT and V1 in living humans. The results suggest that characteristics of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), reflected in OT measurements, are correlated with individual differences in human V1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">High-Definition Transcranial Stimulation over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Alters the Sunk Cost Effect: A Mental Accounting Framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sunk cost effect refers to the fact that human decisions are consistently influenced by previous irrecoverable and irrelevant costs. Recent neuroimaging experiments suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays a pivotal role in the sunk cost effect yet the causal and neurocomputational role of the dlPFC remains elusive. In this study, two cohorts of healthy human male and female adults were recruited to complete a novel two-step decision-making task during the anodal-sham or cathodal-sham high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the dlPFC, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, we showed that the sunk cost deterred participants from making further investment and therefore engendered a de-escalation effect. Such behavior can be captured by a weighted mental accounting model with a recalibrated reference point in which the direction and magnitude of the sunk cost effects hinge on the decision weights apportioned to the option values. Interestingly, transcranial stimulation did not influence participants' initial willingness to incur sunk costs but only altered sunk costs' downstream effects. Specifically, anodal stimulation over the right dlPFC amplified the de-escalation effect of sunk costs whereas cathodal stimulation yielded the opposite result. HD-tDCS also changed the decision weights of the mental accounting model, providing a causal and computational link between PFC and sunk cost effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traditional economic theory assumes that decisions only concern the marginal costs and benefits yet human choices are notoriously susceptible to previously-incurred costs (termed the sunk cost effect). In the current study, we showed that direct current stimulation (DCS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) altered sunk cost effects in participants' subsequent choices. Such effects can be captured by a mental accounting model where transcranial stimulation modulates the decision weights assigned to different options in the value integration process. These findings help elucidate the computational and causal role of the dlPFC in the context of sunk costs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Dependent Warping of Semantic Representations during Search for Visual Action Categories</a></h4>

              
                <p>Object and action perception in cluttered dynamic natural scenes relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. It has been suggested that during visual search for objects, distributed semantic representation of hundreds of object categories is warped to expand the representation of targets. Yet, little is known about whether and where in the brain visual search for action categories modulates semantic representations. To address this fundamental question, we studied brain activity recorded from five subjects (one female) via functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed natural movies and searched for either communication or locomotion actions. We find that attention directed to action categories elicits tuning shifts that warp semantic representations broadly across neocortex and that these shifts interact with intrinsic selectivity of cortical voxels for target actions. These results suggest that attention serves to facilitate task performance during social interactions by dynamically shifting semantic selectivity toward target actions and that tuning shifts are a general feature of conceptual representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to swiftly perceive the actions and intentions of others is a crucial skill for humans that relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. However, little is known about the nature of high-level semantic representations during natural visual search for action categories. Here, we provide the first evidence showing that attention significantly warps semantic representations by inducing tuning shifts in single cortical voxels, broadly spread across occipitotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices. This dynamic attentional mechanism can facilitate action perception by efficiently allocating neural resources to accentuate the representation of task-relevant action categories.</p>

                <p>Errors can elicit post-error adjustments that serve to optimize performance by preventing further errors. An essential but unsolved issue is that whether post-error adjustments are domain-general or domain-specific, which was investigated in the present study through eliciting different types of errors. Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded when male and female subjects performed the Eriksen flanker task. For this study, we examined the aforementioned issue by combining event-related potential and multivariate pattern analysis. The results indicated that post-error slowing, error-related negativity, and error positivity were comparable between congruent and incongruent errors, indicating that errors triggered domain-general interference mechanisms, whereas post-error accuracy and late positive potential elicited by incongruent errors were larger than those elicited by congruent errors, exhibiting domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms. Importantly, no successful decoding soon after errors was found between congruent and incongruent errors, but above-chance decoding was observed between these two types of errors with increasing time, which further support that domain-general adjustments occurred in the early stage, whereas domain-specific adjustments appeared in the late stage. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation results suggested that the late post-error adjustments predicted subsequent behavior performance. Together, this study revealed that early domain-general interference adjustments induced by errors are reflected in error detection and error awareness, which are independent of error types; on the contrary, late domain-specific control adjustments are reflected in attentional adjustments, which are modulated by error types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, clear evidence on the specificity of post-error adjustments is lacking. The present study provides neurophysiological evidence that post-error adjustments simultaneously rely on both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms. Event-related potential results indicated that domain-general adjustments were accompanied by the interference of error detection and error awareness. In contrast, domain-specific adjustments were associated with attentional adjustments. Multivariate pattern analysis further decoded the two features of post-error adjustments in the early stage matching the time patterns of error-related negativity and error positivity and in the late stage corresponding to the late positive potential. Temporal generalization analysis showed that domain-specific processing appeared stably in late post-error adjustments. Hence, we propose that post-error different stages may determine the specificity of post-error adjustments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Antioxidant and Anti-ER Stress Combo Therapy Decreases Inflammation, Secondary Brain Damage and Promotes Neurological Recovery following Traumatic Brain Injury in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The complex pathophysiology of post-traumatic brain damage might need a polypharmacological strategy with a combination of drugs that target multiple, synergistic mechanisms. We currently tested a combination of apocynin (curtails formation of reactive oxygen species), tert-butylhydroquinone (promotes disposal of reactive oxygen species), and salubrinal (prevents endoplasmic reticulum stress) following a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact in adult mice. Adult mice of both sexes treated with the above tri-combo showed alleviated motor and cognitive deficits, attenuated secondary lesion volume, and decreased oxidative DNA damage. Concomitantly, tri-combo treatment regulated post-TBI inflammatory response by decreasing the infiltration of T cells and neutrophils and activation of microglia in both sexes. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism was seen in the case of TBI-induced microgliosis and infiltration of macrophages in the tri-combo&ndash;treated mice. Moreover, the tri-combo treatment prevented TBI-induced white matter volume loss in both sexes. The beneficial effects of tri-combo treatment were long-lasting and were also seen in aged mice. Thus, the present study supports the tri-combo treatment to curtail oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress concomitantly as a therapeutic strategy to improve TBI outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Of the several mechanisms that contribute to TBI pathophysiology, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation play a major role. The present study shows the therapeutic potential of a combination of apocynin, tert-butylhydroquinone, and salubrinal to prevent oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and the interrelated inflammatory response in mice subjected to TBI. The beneficial effects of the tri-combo include alleviation of TBI-induced motor and cognitive deficits and lesion volume. The neuroprotective effects of the tri-combo are also linked to its ability to prevent TBI-induced white matter damage. Importantly, neuroprotection by the tri-combo treatment was observed to be not dependent on sex or age. Our data demonstrate that a polypharmacological strategy is efficacious after TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inflammatory markers in patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome and history of COVID-19 infection: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients who have developed acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has soared rapidly, cardiovascular disease and mortality are influenced by the elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this study is to compare inflammatory markers between patients with ACS who hadn’t previously had COVID-19 and those who’d be infected within the preceding three months; as well as, evaluating the effect of statins on inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: This is a comparative cross-sectional study of 42 patients who presented with ACS and had previously had COVID-19 and 48 patient who had never had COVID-19, who were admitted to the coronary care unit at the Iraqi Center for Heart Disease and Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Iraq. Inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6, and HS-CRP) levels were determined in serum samples of all patients at admission to these centers then one month later, after administration of statins daily using the Sandwich-ELISA Principle, and Immunofluorescence technique for these markers. Result: The baseline for patients who had ACS and COVID-19 three months previously, were IL6 (85.87 ±45.80), HS-CRP (23.19 ± 14.49), and TNF-α (161.94± 240.96) were higher than patients that had ACS but not COVID-19; IL6 (50.77±22.48), HS-CRP (13.64± 12.09), and TNF-α (117.73 ±71.23),(p<0.0001), (p=0.003) and (p=0.201) for IL6, HS-CRP, and TNF-α respectively. Rosuvastatin showed a significant reduction in HS-CRP and IL6 (P<0.001), while Atorvastatin a significant reduction in HS-CRP (P<0.001) after one month of therapy. Yet there was no significant difference in the level of TNF α in these two groups at the end of this study.     Conclusions: The patients with previous COVID-19 still had higher inflammatory markers than those who didn’t. Rosuvastatin 40mg had a more reduction in IL6 than Atorvastatin 40mg after one month and both of them could reduce HS-CRP, but neither could reduce TNF-α in this short period.

     alt="Quantification of CGRP-immunoreactive myenteric neurons in mouse colon"/><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a putative marker of multiaxonal, intrinsic primary afferent neurons in mouse colon. This study quantifies the proportion of myenteric nerve cell bodies along the mouse colon that are immunoreactive to CGRP. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Left atrial myxoma with confirmed Delta variant COVID-19 infection, “to treat or withhold” [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Primary cardiac tumors (PCTs) are extremely rare entities. More than half of PCTs are benign, with myxoma being the most common tumor. Generally, simple tumor resection is the treatment of choice for benign PCTs since it has promising results that yield low complication and recurrence rates. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic era, the mitigation protocols and/or concurrent COVID-19 infection should be taken into account in patient management for the best overall outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with a left atrial myxoma and systemic embolism complication in the form of an ischemic stroke, with a concurrent confirmed COVID-19 delta variant infection.

                Recent allostatic–interoceptive explanations using predictive coding models propose that efficient regulation of the body’s internal milieu is necessary to correctly anticipate environmental needs. We review this framework applied to understanding behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) considering both allostatic overload and interoceptive deficits. First, we show how this framework could explain divergent deficits in bvFTD (cognitive impairments, behavioral maladjustment, brain atrophy, fronto-insular-temporal network atypicality, aberrant interoceptive electrophysiological activity, and autonomic disbalance).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse states and stimuli tune olfactory receptor expression levels to modulate food-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must weigh competing needs and states to generate adaptive behavioral responses to the environment. Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which external sensory information and internal nutritional state are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which sensory and state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal’s overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which sensory- and state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals’ sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of sequence determinants of enhancer function using natural genetic variation</a></h4>

              
                Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context. Using F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Arabidopsis SAC9 enzyme is enriched in a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                Membrane lipids, and especially phosphoinositides, are differentially enriched within the eukaryotic endomembrane system. This generates a landmark code by modulating the properties of each membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] specifically accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast, animal, and plant cells, where it regulates a wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking. However, the functional consequences of mispatterning PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants are unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase <i>SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9</i> (SAC9) in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>Arabidopsis</i>). We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic localization of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on cortical intracellular compartments, which depends on PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production at the plasma membrane. SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of <i>trans</i>-Golgi Network/early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that are coated with clathrin. Furthermore, it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2), a protein involved in endocytic trafficking. In the absence of SAC9, SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis rate is reduced. Together, our results highlight the importance of restricting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and illustrate that one of the consequences of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> misspatterning in plants is to impact the endocytic trafficking.

                Omics-based technologies are driving major advances in precision medicine, but efforts are still required to consolidate their use in drug discovery. In this work, we exemplify the use of multi-omics to support the development of 3-chloropiperidines, a new class of candidate anticancer agents. Combined analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility elucidated the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to test agents. Furthermore, we implemented a new versatile strategy for the integration of RNA- and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) data, able to accelerate and extend the standalone analyses of distinct omic layers. This platform guided the construction of a perturbation-informed basal signature predicting cancer cell lines’ sensitivity and to further direct compound development against specific tumor types. Overall, this approach offers a scalable pipeline to support the early phases of drug discovery, understanding of mechanisms, and potentially inform the positioning of therapeutics in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human WDR5 promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis via KMT2-independent translation regulation</a></h4>

              
                Metastatic breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer related deaths in women and there are few effective therapies against this advanced disease. Emerging evidence suggests that key steps of tumor progression and metastasis are controlled by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. Using an <i>in vivo</i> genetic screen, we identified WDR5 as an actionable epigenetic regulator that is required for metastatic progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer. We found that knockdown of WDR5 in breast cancer cells independently impaired their tumorigenic as well as metastatic capabilities. Mechanistically, WDR5 promotes cell growth by increasing ribosomal gene expression and translation efficiency in a KMT2-independent manner. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition or degradation of WDR5 impedes cellular translation rate and the clonogenic ability of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, combination of WDR5-targeting with mTOR inhibitors leads to potent suppression of translation and proliferation of breast cancer cells. These results reveal novel therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions</a></h4>

              
                Facial affect is expressed dynamically - a giggle, grimace, or an agitated frown. However, the characterization of human affect has relied almost exclusively on static images. This approach cannot capture the nuances of human communication or support the naturalistic assessment of affective disorders. Using the latest in machine vision and systems modelling, we studied dynamic facial expressions of people viewing emotionally salient film clips. We found that the apparent complexity of dynamic facial expressions can be captured by a small number of simple spatiotemporal states - composites of distinct facial actions, each expressed with a unique spectral fingerprint. Sequential expression of these states is common across individuals viewing the same film stimuli but varies in those with the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder. This approach provides a platform for translational research, capturing dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions and enabling new quantitative tools for the study of affective disorders and related mental illnesses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Embryonic cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons form an active, transient circuit motif perturbed by autism-associated mutations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits are composed predominantly of pyramidal-to-pyramidal neuron connections, yet their assembly during embryonic development is not well understood. We show that embryonic layer 5 pyramidal neurons, identified through single cell transcriptomics, display two phases of circuit assembly in vivo. At E14.5, a multi-layered circuit motif, composed of a single layer 5 cell type, forms. This motif is transient, switching to a second circuit motif, involving all three types, by E17.5. In vivo targeted single cell recordings and two-photon calcium imaging of embryonic layer 5 neurons reveal that, in both phases, neurons have active somas and neurites, tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated conductances, and functional glutamatergic synapses. Embryonic layer 5 neurons strongly express autism-associated genes, and perturbing these genes disrupts the switch between the two motifs. Hence, layer 5 pyramidal neurons form transient active pyramidal-to-pyramidal circuits, at the inception of neocortex, and studying these circuits could yield insights into the etiology of autism.

                Memories of past events can be recalled long after the event, indicating stability. But new experiences are also integrated into existing memories, indicating plasticity. In the hippocampus, spatial representations are known to remain stable, but have also been shown to drift over long periods of time. We hypothesized that experience, more than the passage of time, is the driving force behind memory plasticity. We compared the stability of place cells in the hippocampus of mice traversing two similar, familiar tracks for different durations. We found that the more time spent in an environment, the greater the representational drift, regardless of the total elapsed time. Our results suggest that spatial representation is a dynamic process, related to the ongoing experiences within a specific context, and is related to the accumulation of new memories rather than to passive forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lack of the glycine alpha 2 receptor impairs reward-motivated behavior and striatal signal integration.</a></h4>

              
                Distinct developmental pathologies, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, exhibit impaired reward-motivated behavior. Key to proper reward-motivated behavior is the integration of dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs to the striatum. The glycine alpha 2 receptor (GlyR2) is the single functionally expressed glycine receptor in adult striatum, and is therefore ideally positioned to modulate striatal behavior and cellular signal integration. Here, we report excessive appetitive conditioning in GlyR2 knockout animals. We next show that depletion of GlyR2 enhances dopamine-induced increases in the activity of putative dopamine D1-expressing striatal projection neurons, while not affecting dopamine neuron activity. These in vivo behavioral changes are tied to enhanced striatal activation in GlyR2 KO mice, since we found excessive locomotor responses to amphetamine in GlyR2 KO mice that correlate with immediate early gene c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum. 3-D modeling revealed activation of cell ensembles in the striatum in response to D-amphetamine, an increase in number of cells but no shift in intercell distance histograms, in agreement with unaltered dopamine release, in GlyR2 KO mice. Taken together, we show that depletion of GlyR2 impairs reward-motivated behavior and altered striatal signal integration. This sheds important light onto the cellular mechanisms that underlie reward function, and pave the way towards novel therapeutics for the treatment of e.g. schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A slow 5-HT1AR-mediated recurrent inhibitory network in raphe computes contextual value through synaptic facilitation</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a diverse constellation of long-range synaptic inputs, yet unifying principles of local circuitry and its dynamics are largely unknown - a crucial component of understanding how 5-HT output controls behavior. Here, we developed a formalism bridging optogenetic, electrophysiological, computational and behavioral strategies to reveal how the dynamics of local circuitry in DRN control the expression of reward associations. Using long-range input from lateral habenula (LHb) to interrogate functional DRN circuitry, we uncover 5-HT1A receptor-mediated local recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition by 5-HT1A receptors. These inhibitory 5-HT connections were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating, and gated spike output of 5-HT neurons. Targeted physiology and modeling approaches revealed that these functional connectivity features collectively support the emergence of a paradoxical excitation-driven inhibition in response to high frequency LHb activation, and of a winner-take-all computation over protracted timescales. In vivo, we found that optogenetic activation of LHb inputs to DRN transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task. In accordance with quantitative model predictions, this disruption occurred exclusively at the conjunction of high frequency LHb activation and high predicted reward value, and was not due to a modulation of the underlying reward association. Thus, we propose that recurrent dynamics in the DRN support a contextual value computation, where stable learned associations are integrated with dynamic environmental inputs to support sharp behavioral state transitions in changing environments.

                Anosmia was identified as a hallmark of COVID-19 early in the pandemic, however, with the emergence of variants of concern, the clinical profile induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection has changed, with anosmia being less frequent. Several studies have focused on the neuropathogenesis of the original SARS-CoV-2, but little is known about the neuropathological potential of the variants. Here, we assessed the clinical, olfactory and inflammatory conditions of golden hamsters infected with the original SARS-CoV-2, its ORF7-deleted mutant, and three variants: Gamma, Delta and Omicron/BA.1. We show that infected animals developed a variant-dependent clinical disease, and that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to causing olfactory disturbances. Conversely, all SARS-CoV-2 variants were found to be neuroinvasive, regardless of the clinical presentation they induce. With newly-generated nanoluciferase-expressing SARS-CoV-2, we validated the olfactory pathway as a main entry point towards the brain, confirming that neuroinvasion and anosmia are independent phenomena upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                Synapses from the same axon onto the same dendrite have a common history of coactivation and have similar spine head volumes, suggesting that synapse function precisely modulates structure. We have applied Shannon information theory to obtain a new analysis of synaptic information storage capacity (SISC) using non-overlapping dimensions of dendritic spine head volumes as a measure of synaptic weights with distinct states. Spine head volumes in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1 occupied 24 distinct states (4.1 bits). In contrast, spine head volumes in the middle molecular layer of control dentate gyrus occupied only 5 distinct states (2 bits). Thus, synapses in different hippocampal regions had different synaptic information storage capacities. Moreover, these were not fixed properties but increased during long-term potentiation, such that by 30 min following induction, spine head volumes in the middle molecular layer increased to occupy 10 distinct states (3 bits), and this increase lasted for at least 2 hours. Measurement of the Kullback-Liebler divergence revealed that synaptic states evolved closer to storing the maximum amount of information during long-term potentiation. These results show that our new SISC analysis provides an improved and reliable estimate of information storage capacity of synapses. SISC revealed that the Shannon information after long-term potentiation is nearly maximized for the number of distinguishable states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Parcellation Scheme of Mouse Isocortex Based on Reversals in Connectivity Gradients</a></h4>

              
                The brain comprises several anatomically clearly separated structures. This parcellation is often extended into the isocortex, where border demarcations are less clear due to its relatively homogeneous structure. Yet, established parcellation schemes exist, based on anatomical, physiological or functional differences. Here, we derive a parcellation scheme based purely on connectomics, that is, the spatial structure of long-range synaptic connections within the cortex. To that end, we analyze a publicly available dataset of average mouse brain connectivity, and split the isocortex into disjunct regions. Instead of clustering connectivity based on similarity or modularity, our scheme is inspired by methods that split sensory cortices into subregions where gradients of neuronal response properties, such as the location of the receptive field, reverse. We developed a method to calculate comparable gradients from voxelized brain connectivity data and automatically detect reversals in them. This approach better respects the known presence of functional gradients within brain regions than clustering-based approaches. Placing borders at the reversals resulted in a parcellation into 41 subregions that differs significantly from an established scheme in nonrandom ways, but is comparable in terms of the modularity of connectivity between regions. It revealed unexpected trends of connectivity, such a a tripartite split of somatomotor regions along an anterior to posterior gradient. The method can be readily adapted to other organisms and data sources, such as human functional connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">S1 represents multisensory contexts and somatotopic locations within and outside the bounds of the cortical homunculus</a></h4>

              
                The responsiveness of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to physical tactile stimuli is well documented but the extent to which it is modulated by vision is unresolved. Additionally, recent literature has suggested that tactile events are represented in S1 in a more complex, generalized manner than its long-established topographic organization. To better characterize S1 function, neural activity was recorded from a tetraplegic patient implanted with microelectrode arrays in S1 during 1s stroking touches to the forearm (evoking numb sensation) or finger (naturalistic sensation). Touch conditions included visually observed first person physical touches, physical touches without vision, and visual touches without physical contact which occurred either to a third person, an inanimate object, or the patient's own body in virtual reality. Two major findings emerged from this dataset. The first was that vision strongly modulates S1 activity, but only if there is a physical element to the touch, suggesting that passive observation of touches is not sufficient to recruit S1 neurons. The second was that despite the location of the recording arrays in a putative arm area of S1, neural activity was able to represent both arm and finger touches in physical touch conditions. Arm touches were encoded more strongly and specifically, supporting the idea that S1 encodes tactile events primarily through its topographic organization, as well as in a more general manner encompassing larger areas of the body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contrast and luminance gain control in the macaque'slateral geniculate nucleus</a></h4>

              
                In natural scenes, there is substantial variation in the mean and variance of light levels (luminance and contrast). Retinal ganglion cells maintain their sensitivity despite this variation and their limited signaling bandwidth using two adaptive mechanisms, which control luminance and contrast gain. However, the signature of each mechanism and their interactions further downstream of the retina are unknown. We recorded neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in anesthetized adult male macaques and characterized how they adapt to changes in contrast and luminance. As contrast increases, neurons in the magnocellular layers maintain sensitivity to high temporal frequency stimuli but attenuate sensitivity to low temporal-frequency stimuli. Neurons in the parvocellular layers do not adapt to changes in contrast. As luminance increases, magnocellular and parvocellular cells increase their sensitivity to high temporal frequency stimuli. Adaptation to luminance is independent of adaptation to contrast, as previously reported for LGN neurons in the cat. Our results are similar to those previously reported for macaque retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that adaptation to luminance and contrast result from two independent mechanisms that are retinal in origin.

                Widefield imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) is a promising approach for understanding the role of large cortical networks in the neural coding of behavior. However, the slow kinetics of current GEVIs limit their deployment for single-trial imaging of rapid neuronal voltage dynamics. Here, we developed a high-throughput platform to screen for GEVIs that combine fast kinetics with high brightness, sensitivity, and photostability under widefield one-photon illumination. Rounds of directed evolution produced JEDI-1P, a green-emitting fluorescent indicator whose performance is improved for all metrics. Next, we optimized a neonatal intracerebroventricular delivery method to achieve cost-effective and wide-spread JEDI-1P expression in mice. We also developed an approach to effectively correct optical measurements from hemodynamic and motion artifacts. Finally, we achieved stable brain-wide voltage imaging and successfully tracked gamma-frequency whisker and visual stimulations in awake mice in single trials, opening the door to investigating the role of high-frequency signals in brain computations.

                Investigating the strategies engaged by subjects in decision making and learning requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Here we present a simple but effective probabilistic approach to tracking choice strategies at trial resolution, using Bayesian evidence accumulation. We show this approach identifies both successful learning and the exploratory strategies used in decision tasks performed by humans, non-human primates, rats, and synthetic agents. We find learning occurs earlier and more often than estimated using classical approaches. Also, win-stay and lose-shift strategies, often considered as complementary, are consistently used independently, with the adoption of lose-shift preceding both learning new rules and switching away from old rules. Our approach can be extended to any discrete choice strategy, and its low computational cost is ideally suited for real-time analysis and closed-loop control.

                Most brain circuits comprise intermingled neuronal populations with heterogeneous input and output connectivity, which limits the ability to unambiguously map how the circuit of interest synaptically links specific input pathways to specific downstream targets. By applying newly available transsynaptic and intersectional tracing tools to investigate input-output connectivity of the superior colliculus (SC), a conserved midbrain-node with extensive long-range connectivity throughout the brain, we identify hitherto unknown connectivity features underlying cortical control of SC sensory-motor transformations. We pinpoint a whisker region in the SC of mice as a node for the integration of somatosensory and motor cortical signals. Tracing input-defined pathways from brainstem, motor- and somatosensory cortices to the whisker SC and further on to collicular downstream targets in the midbrain and brainstem revealed that long-range inputs establish synaptic contacts with inhibitory and excitatory SC-output neurons, thereby providing monosynaptic trans-collicular pathways between specific cortical and subcortical circuits for somato-motor integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Natural and pathological aging distinctively impact the vomeronasal system and social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Normal aging and many age-related diseases such as Alzheimer disease cause deficits in olfaction, however it is currently unknown how natural and pathological aging impact the detection of social odors which might contribute to the impoverishment of social behavior at old age further worsening overall health. Here, we investigated the effect of aging in the recognition of social cues and the display of social behavior. Our findings indicate that aging distinctively disrupts the processing of social olfactory cues decreasing social odor exploration, discrimination and habituation in both wild type senescent (2-year-old) mice and in 1-year-old double mutant model of Alzheimer disease (APP/PS1). Furthermore, social novelty was diminished in 1-year-old APP/PS1 mice, indicating that alterations in the processing of social cues are accelerated during pathological aging. Analysis of the vomeronasal organ, the main gateway to pheromone-encoded information, indicated that natural and pathological aging distinctively reduce the neurogenic ability of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Cell proliferation remained majorly preserved in 1-year model of Alzheimer disease (APP/PS1), whereas naturally aged animals exhibited significant deficiencies in the number of mature, proliferative and progenitor cells. This study reveals fundamental differences in the cellular processes by which natural and pathological aging disrupt the exploration of social cues and social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Near infrared spectroscopy detection of hemispheric cerebral ischemia following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats</a></h4>

              
                Timely and sensitive in vivo estimation of ischemic stroke-induced brain infarction are necessary to guide diagnosis and evaluation of treatments efficacy. The gold standard for estimation of the cerebral infarction volume is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is expensive and not readily accessible. Measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is the status quo for confirming reduced blood flow in experimental ischemic stroke models. However, rCBF reduction following cerebral artery occlusion often does not correlate with subsequent infarct volume. In the present study, we employed the continuous-wave near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique to monitor cerebral oxygenation during 90 min of the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=8, male). The NIRS device consisted of a controller module and an optical sensor with two LED light sources and two photodiodes making up two parallel channels for monitoring left and right cerebral hemispheres. Optical intensity measurements were converted to deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) changes relative to a 2-min window prior to MCAO. Area under the curve (auc) for Hb and HbO2 was calculated for the 90-min occlusion period for each hemisphere (ipsilateral and contralateral). To obtain a measure of total ischemia, auc of the contralateral side was subtracted from the ipsilateral side resulting in {Delta}Hb and {Delta}HbO2 parameters. Infarct volume (IV) was calculated by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24h reperfusion. Results showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.81, p = 0.03) between {Delta}Hb and infarct volume. In conclusion, our results show feasibility of using a noninvasive optical imaging instrument, namely NIRS, in monitoring cerebral ischemia in a rodent stroke model. This cost-effective, non-invasive technique may improve the rigor of experimental models of ischemic stroke by enabling in vivo longitudinal assessment of cerebral oxygenation and ischemic injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signature of random connectivity in the distributionof neuronal tuning curves.</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the relationship between circuit properties and the organization of neuronal population activity is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The fine tuning of neuronal activity to specific values of environmental or internal features are canonical examples of how information is encoded in the brain, possibly resulting from precisely organized inputs. Yet, in the cortex, finely tuned neurons are often recorded together with neurons whose tuning is much less specific, for example those of inhibitory neurons, and the connectivity statistics accounting for the overall distribution of tuning curves is unclear. Here, using recordings in the mouse head-direction system, we first show both in simulation and analytically that random linear combinations of ideal finely tuned inputs reproduce the distribution of fast-spiking neuron tuning curves, a class of neurons believed to operate in the linear regime. This transformation preserves, on the population level, the singular spectrum of the input tuning curves but the relative power of each singular component is independently distributed in each output cell, leading to a distribution ranging from uni-modal to symmetrically tuned cells. We then generalize the model to a non-linear transformation of the inputs, combined with background inhibition. Using recordings from input neurons in the thalamus, where tuning curves are near-ideal, the model reproduces for various levels of inhibition the entire range of observed neuronal responses in the cortex, from precisely and narrowly tuned neurons to multipeak excitatory cells, as well as symmetrical tuning curves of inhibitory neurons. We replicate these findings in a dataset of hippocampal recordings. In conclusion, the full distribution of tuning curves is a signature of input connectivity statistics, which, for fast-spiking neurons and thalamocortical circuits, is likely to be random rather than specifically organized.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hormone-sleep interactions predict cerebellar connectivity and behavior in aging females</a></h4>

              
                Sex hormones fluctuate over the course of the female lifespan and are associated with brain health and cognition. Thus, hormonal changes throughout female adulthood, and with menopause in particular, may contribute to sex differences in brain function and behavior. Further, sex hormones have been correlated with sleep patterns, which also exhibit sex-specific impacts on the brain and behavior. As such, the interplay between hormones and sleep may contribute to late-life brain and behavioral outcomes in females. Here, in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older females (n = 79, ages 35-86), we evaluated the effect of hormone-sleep interactions on cognitive and motor performance as well as cerebellar-frontal network connectivity. Salivary samples were used to measure 17{beta}-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone levels while overnight actigraphy was used to quantify sleep patterns. Cognitive behavior was quantified using the composite average of standardized scores on memory, processing speed, and attentional tasks, and motor behavior was indexed with sequence learning, balance, and dexterity tasks. We analyzed resting-state connectivity correlations for two specific cerebellar-frontal networks: a Crus I to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex network and a Lobule V to primary motor cortex network. In sum, results indicate that sex hormones and sleep patterns interact to predict cerebellar-frontal connectivity and behavior in aging females. Together, the current findings further highlight the potential consequences of endocrine aging in females and suggest that the link between sex hormones and sleep patterns may contribute, in part, to divergent outcomes between sexes in advanced age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noninvasive method for monitoring breathing patterns in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Respiration is strongly linked to internal states such as arousal, emotion, and even cognitive processes and provides objective biological information to estimate these states in humans and animals. However, the measurement of respiration has not been established in macaque monkeys that have been widely used as model animals for understanding various higher brain functions. In the present study, we developed a method to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys. We first measured the temperature of their nasal breathing, which changes between inspiration and expiration phases, in an anesthetized condition and estimated the respiration pattern. We compared the estimated pattern with that obtained by a conventional chest band method that has been used in humans and applies to anesthetized, but not behaving, monkeys. These respiration patterns matched well, suggesting that the measurement of nasal air temperature can be used to monitor the respiration of monkeys. Furthermore, we confirmed that the respiration frequency in behaving monkeys monitored by the measurement of nasal air temperature was not affected by the orofacial movement of licking to obtain the liquid reward. We next examined the frequency of respiration when they listened to music or white noise. The respiratory frequency was higher when the monkeys listened to music than the noise. This result is consistent with a phenomenon in humans and indicates the accuracy of our monitoring method. These data suggest that the measurement of nasal air temperature enables us to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys and thereby estimate their internal states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient coding, channel capacity and the emergence of retinal mosaics</a></h4>

              
                Among the most striking features of retinal organization is the grouping of its output neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), into a diversity of functional types. Each of these types exhibits a mosaic-like organization of receptive fields (RFs) that tiles the retina and visual space. Previous work has shown that many features of RGC organization, including the existence of ON and OFF cell types, the structure of spatial RFs, and their relative arrangement, can be predicted on the basis of efficient coding theory. This theory posits that the nervous system is organized to maximize information in its encoding of stimuli while minimizing metabolic costs. Here, we use efficient coding theory to present a comprehensive account of mosaic organization in the case of natural videos as the retinal channel capacity---the number of simulated RGCs available for encoding---is varied. We show that mosaic density increases with channel capacity up to a series of critical points at which, surprisingly, new cell types emerge. Each successive cell type focuses on increasingly high temporal frequencies and integrates signals over large spatial areas. In addition, we show we show theoretically and in simulation that a transition from mosaic alignment to anti-alignment across pairs of cell types is observed with increasing output noise and decreasing input noise. Together, these results offer a unified perspective on the relationship between retinal mosaics, efficient coding, and channel capacity that can help to explain the stunning functional diversity of retinal cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RIM-BP2 is required for rapid neurotransmitter release through regulation of Ca2+ channel clustering at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicles dock and fuse at the presynaptic active zone (AZ), the specialized site for transmitter release. AZ proteins play multiple roles such as recruitment of Ca2+ channels as well as synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion. However, the precise role of each AZ protein type remains unknown. At phasic synapses having high release probability, Rab3-interacting molecule-binding protein2 (RIM-BP2) is known to affect Ca2+ channel localization at AZs. In order to dissect the role of RIM-BP2 at tonic synapses having low release probability, we applied electrophysiological recording and super-resolution imaging to hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of RIM-BP2 KO mice. By using whole cell capacitance measurements, we found that reduced Ca2+ currents were responsible for the decreased rates of transmitter release in RIM-BP2 KO terminals. Consistently, STED microscopy pictured lower densities of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels at AZs deficient in RIM-BP2. Our results suggest that the RIM-BP2 function differs between phasic and tonic synapses.

	<p>The cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a highly complex anatomical compartment consisting of numerous nervous and vascular structures that present mutual and intricate spatial relationships. CPA surgery represents, therefore, a constant challenge for neurosurgeons. Over the years, neurosurgeons have developed and refined several solutions with the aim of maximizing the surgical treatment effects while minimizing the invasiveness and risks for the patient. In this paper, we present our integrated approach to CPA surgery, describing its advantages in treating pathologies in this anatomical district. Our approach incorporates the use of technology, such as neuronavigation, along with advanced and multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) techniques, with the final goal of making this surgery safe and effective.</p>

	<p>Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is one of the least studied and understood developmental disorders. One area that has been minimally investigated in DCD is potential issues with sensory modulation. Further, in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) sensory modulation is related to many other challenges (e.g., social issues, repetitive behaviors, anxiety); however, such potential relationships in children with DCD have been largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is to explore sensory modulation differences in DCD and to understand the relationships between sensory modulation and social emotional measures, behavior, and motor skills in DCD in comparison to ASD and typically developing (TD) peers. Participants (aged 8&amp;amp;ndash;17) and their caregivers (DCD, N = 26; ASD, N = 57; and TD, N = 53) completed behavioral and clinical measures. The results indicated that 31% of the DCD group showed sensory modulation difficulties, with the DCD group falling between the ASD and TD groups. In the DCD group, sensory modulation was significantly associated with anxiety, empathic concern, repetitive behaviors, and motor skills. Data are compared to patterns seen in ASD and TD groups and implications for interventions are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Although there is increasing knowledge about adjustment disorder (AjD) based on the new diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), less is known on AjD in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of AjD and its risk factors in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Methods: The cross-sectional study sample comprised 1745 adolescents from Japan (n = 913) and Lithuania (n = 832). AjD was assessed using the Adjustment Disorder New Module-8 (ADNM-8). We compared the prevalence of AjD in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Using multinominal logistic regression analysis, we examined the effects of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and cumulative stressors as societal and cultural factors, resilience as an intrapersonal factor, and loneliness and perceived support as interpersonal factors on adolescent AjD. Results: The prevalence of probable AjD was 11.7% in Lithuanian adolescents and 6.9% in Japanese adolescents. Gender, socioeconomic status, cumulative stressors, resilience, loneliness, and perceived positive social support were each significantly associated with AjD risk. Conclusions: This cross-cultural comparative study revealed characteristics of the stressors and prevalence of AjD among Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. In terms of the socio-interpersonal framework model for the stress&amp;amp;ndash;response syndrome, sociocultural, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors were found to be risk factors associated with AjD in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Glucose and platelet are two easily obtained clinical indicators; the present research aimed to demonstrate their association with hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients without thrombolytic or thrombectomy therapy. This was a single-center retrospective study. Patients who were diagnosed with HT after AIS were included in the HT group. Meanwhile, using the propensity score matching (PSM) approach, with a ratio of 1:2, matched patients without HT were included in the non-HT group. Serum G/P levels were measured on the first morning after admission (at least eight hours after the last meal). Characteristics were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the independent relationship between G/P and HT after AIS, with G/P being divided into quartiles. From January 2013 to March 2022, we consecutively included 643 AIS patients with HT (426/643 [66.25%] with HI and 217/643 [33.75%] with PH), and 1282 AIS patients without HT, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The HT group had higher G/P levels than the non-HT group (0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02 vs. 0.03 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, there was no difference in G/P levels between HI and PH subgroups (0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02 vs. 0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02, p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Moreover, the G/P levels were divided into quartiles (Q1 &amp;amp;le; 0.022; Q2 = 0.023&amp;amp;ndash;0.028; Q3 = 0.029&amp;amp;ndash;0.039; Q4 &amp;amp;ge; 0.040), with Q1 being settled as the reference layer. After controlling the confounders, multivariate regression analyses showed that the Q4 layer (Q4: G/P &amp;amp;ge; 0.040) was independently associated with elevated HT risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.31&amp;amp;ndash;2.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). G/P levels on admission were independently associated with HT risk in AIS patients. In clinical practice, adequate attention should be paid to AIS patients with elevated G/P levels (G/P &amp;amp;ge; 0.040).</p>

	<p>There are increasing reports that anticancer drugs, especially immunotherapy and specific targeted therapy, can cause uveitis, but it is not fully understood whether the clinical features of this drug-induced uveitis differ from those of other types of uveitis and whether there are differences between these drugs. We retrospectively reviewed the published cases and case series in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane from January 2011 to October 2020. We analysed the data, including patients&amp;amp;rsquo; basic information, medications used, duration of use, time to onset, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of uveitis. We focused on the differences in uveitis caused by immunotherapy and specific targeted therapy. Altogether 93 cases (43 men, 48 women, and 2 cases whose gender was not mentioned) reported in 55 articles were included in this study. The average age was 59.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.5 years. Eighty percent of the patients had bilateral involvement. Sixty cases were caused by immunotherapy (64.5%), and twenty-six were caused by specific targeted therapy (27.9%). No significant difference was found in the mean time from treatment to onset between the two groups. Anticancer drug-induced uveitis can involve all parts of the uvea from anterior to posterior, manifested as anterior chamber flare, anterior chamber cells, papillitis, macular oedema, subretinal fluid, and choroidal effusion. Anterior uveitis (24 cases, 40.0%) was more common in immunotherapy, and intermediate uveitis (8 cases, 30.8%) was more common in specific targeted therapy. The mean LogMAR visual acuity in specific targeted therapy at presentation was lower than in immunotherapy, but it was not statistically significant. Corticosteroid therapy can effectively control uveitis induced by anticancer drugs. However, the survival prognosis was poor. Among the 19 patients with reported cancer prognosis, seven (36.8%) had no cancer progression, eight (42.1%) had further metastases, and four (21.0%) died of cancer. In conclusion, uveitis caused by anticancer drugs involves both eyes and manifests as various types of uveitis. Patients with specific targeted therapy are more likely to have intermediate uveitis and low vision, and immunotherapy patients are more likely to have anterior uveitis. Corticosteroids are effective against uveitis caused by anticancer drugs.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Glioma is the most common primary tumor in the central nervous system, and glioma-related epilepsy (GRE) is one of its common symptoms. The abnormalities of white matter fiber tracts are involved in attributing changes in patients with epilepsy (Rud&amp;amp;agrave;, R, 2012).This study aimed to assess frontal lobe gliomas&amp;amp;rsquo; effects on the cerebral white matter fiber tracts. (2) Methods: Thirty patients with frontal lobe glioma were enrolled and divided into two groups (Ep and nEep). Among them, five patients were excluded due to apparent insular or temporal involvement. A set of 14 age and gender-matched healthy controls were also included. All the enrolled subjects underwent preoperative conventional magnetic resonance images (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, we used tract-based spatial statistics to analyze the characteristics of the white matter fiber tracts. (3) Results: The two patient groups showed similar patterns of mean diffusivity (MD) elevations in most regions; however, in the ipsilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and superior corona radiata, the significant voxels of the EP group were more apparent than in the nEP group. No significant fractional anisotropy (FA) elevations or MD degenerations were found in the current study. (4) Conclusions: Gliomas grow and invade along white matter fiber tracts. This study assessed the effects of GRE on the white matter fiber bundle skeleton by TBSS, and we found that the changes in the white matter skeleton of the frontal lobe tumor-related epilepsy were mainly concentrated in the IFOF, SLF, and superior corona radiata. This reveals that GRE significantly affects the white matter fiber microstructure of the tumor.</p>

Particularly, interpersonal violence is associated with high rates of comorbidity between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and SUD, and these comorbid disorders exhibit high levels of overlapping symptomatology. Theoretical models proposed to explain the bidirectional relationship between PTSD and SUD include the self-medication hypothesis and susceptibility hypothesis. In this article, we explore neurobiologic changes associated with trauma, PTSD, and SUD that underly dysregulated stress response. Examining lessons learned from recent translational and clinical research, we propose that further elucidating the neurobiologic etiology of comorbid PTSD and SUD will require a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, including the integration of preclinical and clinical studies, exploration of biologic markers in clinical studies, and accumulation of larger studies and longitudinal studies with the power to study PTSD and SUD. Such research can transform the field and ultimately reduce high rates and costly impairment of co-occurring PTSD and SUD across the lifespan.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Variation in TAF1 Expression in Female Carrier-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Human Brain Ontogeny Has Implications for Adult Neostriatum Vulnerability in X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of <I>TAF1</I>, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) status and identified clonal lines that express either the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that <I>TAF1</I> is decreased in most female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, <I>TAF1</I> expression is not sexually dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that regional-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific mechanisms regulate <I>TAF1</I>, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the decreased <I>TAF1</I> expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of <I>TAF1</I> function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Uncovering the Locus of Object-Context-Based Modulations in Depth Processing Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural responses of dorsal visual area V7 and lateral occipital complex (LOC) have been shown to correlate with changes in behavioral metrics of depth sensitivity observed as a function of object context, although it is unclear as to whether the behavioral manifestation results from an alteration of early depth-specific responses in V7 or arises as a result of alterations of object-level representations at LOC that subsequently feed back to affect disparity readouts in dorsal cortex. Here, we used online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the roles of these two areas in giving rise to context&ndash;disparity interactions. Stimuli were disparity-defined geometric objects rendered as random-dot stereograms, presented in geometrically plausible and implausible variations. Observers&rsquo; sensitivity to depth (depth discrimination) or object identity (plausibility discrimination) was indexed while receiving repetitive TMS at one of the two sites of interest (V7, LOC) along with a control site (Cz). TMS over LOC produced results no different from TMS over baseline Cz (and prior no-TMS behavioral work). That is, depth sensitivity was higher for implausible versus plausible objects. Strikingly, TMS over V7 abolished differences in depth sensitivity for implausible versus plausible objects. V7 serves as a key locus in bringing stereosensitivity changes because of object context, perhaps by reweighing stereoscopic data en route to informing object&ndash;motoric interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What is the nature of motor adaptation to dynamic perturbations?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Etienne Moullet, Agnès Roby-Brami, Emmanuel Guigon</p>

When human participants repeatedly encounter a velocity-dependent force field that distorts their movement trajectories, they adapt their motor behavior to recover straight trajectories. Computational models suggest that adaptation to a force field occurs at the action selection level through changes in the mapping between goals and actions. The quantitative prediction from these models indicates that early perturbed trajectories before adaptation and late unperturbed trajectories after adaptation should have opposite curvature, i.e. one being a mirror image of the other. We tested these predictions in a human adaptation experiment and we found that the expected mirror organization was either absent or much weaker than predicted by the models. These results are incompatible with adaptation occurring at the action selection level but compatible with adaptation occurring at the goal selection level, as if adaptation corresponds to aiming toward spatially remapped targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reconstructing the course of the COVID-19 epidemic over 2020 for US states and counties: Results of a Bayesian evidence synthesis model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie H. Chitwood, Marcus Russi, Kenneth Gunasekera, Joshua Havumaki, Fayette Klaassen, Virginia E. Pitzer, Joshua A. Salomon, Nicole A. Swartwood, Joshua L. Warren, Daniel M. Weinberger, Ted Cohen, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Reported COVID-19 cases and deaths provide a delayed and incomplete picture of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States (US). Accurate estimates of both the timing and magnitude of infections are needed to characterize viral transmission dynamics and better understand COVID-19 disease burden. We estimated time trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and other COVID-19 outcomes for every county in the US, from the first reported COVID-19 case in January 13, 2020 through January 1, 2021. To do so we employed a Bayesian modeling approach that explicitly accounts for reporting delays and variation in case ascertainment, and generates daily estimates of incident SARS-CoV-2 infections on the basis of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. The model is freely available as the <i>covidestim</i> R package. Nationally, we estimated there had been 49 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 404,214 COVID-19 deaths by the end of 2020, and that 28% of the US population had been infected. There was county-level variability in the timing and magnitude of incidence, with local epidemiological trends differing substantially from state or regional averages, leading to large differences in the estimated proportion of the population infected by the end of 2020. Our estimates of true COVID-19 related deaths are consistent with independent estimates of excess mortality, and our estimated trends in cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are consistent with trends in seroprevalence estimates from available antibody testing studies. Reconstructing the underlying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections across US counties allows for a more granular understanding of disease trends and the potential impact of epidemiological drivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">WhichTF is functionally important in your open chromatin data?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosuke Tanigawa, Ethan S. Dyer, Gill Bejerano</p>

We present WhichTF, a computational method to identify functionally important transcription factors (TFs) from chromatin accessibility measurements. To rank TFs, WhichTF applies an ontology-guided functional approach to compute novel enrichment by integrating accessibility measurements, high-confidence pre-computed conservation-aware TF binding sites, and putative gene-regulatory models. Comparison with prior sheer abundance-based methods reveals the unique ability of WhichTF to identify context-specific TFs with functional relevance, including NF-κB family members in lymphocytes and GATA factors in cardiac cells. To distinguish the transcriptional regulatory landscape in closely related samples, we apply differential analysis and demonstrate its utility in lymphocyte, mesoderm developmental, and disease cells. We find suggestive, under-characterized TFs, such as RUNX3 in mesoderm development and GLI1 in systemic lupus erythematosus. We also find TFs known for stress response, suggesting routine experimental caveats that warrant careful consideration. WhichTF yields biological insight into known and novel molecular mechanisms of TF-mediated transcriptional regulation in diverse contexts, including human and mouse cell types, cell fate trajectories, and disease-associated cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of differences and commonalities in wildlife hunting across the Africa-Europe South-North gradient</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mona Estrella Bachmann, Lars Kulik, Tsegaye Gatiso, Martin Reinhardt Nielsen, Dagmar Haase, Marco Heurich, Ana Buchadas, Lukas Bösch, Dustin Eirdosh, Andreas Freytag, Jonas Geldmann, Arash Ghoddousi, Thurston Cleveland Hicks, Isabel Ordaz-Németh, Siyu Qin, Tenekwetche Sop, Suzanne van Beeck Calkoen, Karsten Wesche, Hjalmar S. Kühl</p>

Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally, with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North. Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated, and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal, socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North. Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management. Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal mechanisms for achieving this goal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Variations in sexual network connectivity may explain dramatic variations in sexually transmitted infection prevalence between populations and over time: a selected four-country analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been noted to vary dramatically between population groups and over time. Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored. Methods: The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson’s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years. Results: In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity. Conclusions: Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes toward and knowledge of collaboration of dental and medical practice among medical students in Southern India: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:    Enhancing oral health care services provided through inter-professional collaboration between medical and dental practitioner is important, and even essential. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice among medical students attending colleges in Southern India. Methods:       A cross sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among medical students and interns of medical colleges in coastal South India with prior information and permission. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions to assess attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice. The demographic backgrounds of participants were also recorded. Chi square test was employed for data analysis. The responses obtained were correlated with age, gender and year of study of participants using Pearson’s correlation test Results:        A total 250 questionnaires were distributed and 234 responses were appropriately completed. Most of the students agreed that oral health was an integral part of systemic health, however participants disagreed on attending compulsory rotation in dentistry at a statistically significant level (p<0.05), moreover participants did not agree with physicians having an active role in motivating their patients for regular dental check-up. 82% of the medical students believe that dental check-up should be included in health packages under health insurance. A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was observed among 3 rd year & 4 th year students and interns and also it was found that female students provided more positive responses towards medical-dental collaboration. Conclusions:        Even though medical students showed fairly positive attitudes and knowledge towards dentistry, the analysis within the study groups showed that knowledge and attitudes regarding the collaborative practice worsened over the academic years among the medical students. In order to destigmatize and foster interprofessional collaboration which would contribute to higher resource efficiency and the standard of care, continuing education in both the disciplines would be highly beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elevated shock index and modified shock index are associated with mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac event rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

                How lncRNA-Lsd1 interplay affects cell differentiation remains unclear in vivo. Shao et al. identify three long hairpin RNAs as Lsd1-interacting non-coding RNAs (LINRs). LINRs function to support fly egg production. At the cellular level, LINR-2 modulates Lsd1 function to regulate cell-specific differentiation of GSCs and follicle progenitors during fly oogenesis.

This uncoupling is due to LIMK-mediated cofilin inactivation, which reduces both actin turnover and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) recruitment to synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-canonical function of an Hif-1α splice variant contributes to the sustained flight of locusts</a></h4>

              
                The hypoxia inducible factor (Hif) pathway is functionally conserved across metazoans in modulating cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, the functions of this pathway under aerobic physiological conditions are rarely investigated. Here, we show that Hif-1α2, a locust Hif-1α isoform, does not induce canonical hypoxic responses but functions as a specific regulator of locust flight, which is a completely aerobic physiological process. Two Hif-1α splice variants were identified in locusts, a ubiquitously expressed Hif-1α1 and a muscle-predominantly expressed Hif-1α2. Hif-1α1 that induces typical hypoxic responses upon hypoxia exposure remains inactive during flight. By contrast, the expression of Hif-1α2, which lacks C-terminal transactivation domain, is less sensitive to oxygen tension but induced extensively by flying. Hif-1α2 regulates physiological processes involved in glucose metabolism and antioxidation during flight and sustains flight endurance by maintaining redox homeostasis through upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1.

                <b>Background:</b> Young people living with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) are at increased risk of schizophrenia, intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In common with these conditions, 22q11.2DS is also associated with sleep problems. We investigated whether abnormal sleep or sleep-dependent network activity in 22q11.2DS reflects convergent, early signatures of neural circuit disruption also evident in associated neurodevelopmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear fascin regulates cancer cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Fascin is an important regulator of F-actin bundling leading to enhanced filopodia assembly. Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently, fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DDR. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumourigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">p75NTR prevents the onset of cerebellar granule cell migration via RhoA activation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal migration is one of the fundamental processes during brain development. Several neurodevelopmental disorders can be traced back to dysregulated migration. Although substantial efforts have been placed in identifying molecular signals that stimulate migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that restrict migration. These restrictive mechanisms are essential for proper development since it helps coordinate the timing for each neuronal population to arrive and establish proper connections. Moreover, preventing migration away from a proliferative niche is necessary in maintaining a pool of proliferating cells until the proper number of neuronal progenitors is attained. Here, using mice and rats, we identify an anti-migratory role for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cerebellar development. Our results show that granule cell precursors (GCPs) robustly express p75NTR in the external granule layer (EGL) when they are proliferating during postnatal development, however, they do not express p75NTR when they migrate either from the rhombic lip during embryonic development or from the EGL during postnatal development. We show that p75NTR prevented GCP migration by maintaining elevated levels of active RhoA. The expression of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of the granule cells even in the presence of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a well-established chemotactic signal for this cell population. Our findings suggest that the expression of p75NTR might be a critical signal that stops and maintains the GCPs in the proliferative niche of the EGL, by promoting the clonal expansion of cerebellar granule neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast, high-throughput production of improved rabies viral vectors for specific, efficient and versatile transsynaptic retrograde labeling</a></h4>

              
                To understand the function of neuronal circuits it is crucial to disentangle the connectivity patterns within the network. However, most tools currently used to explore connectivity have low throughput, low selectivity, or limited accessibility. Here, we report the development of an improved packaging system for the production of the highly neurotropic RVdG­­<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors, yielding titers orders of magnitude higher with no background contamination, at a fraction of the production time, while preserving the efficiency of transsynaptic labeling. Along with the production pipeline, we developed suites of 'starter' AAV and bicistronic RVdG­­-CVS-N2c vectors, enabling retrograde labeling from a wide range of neuronal populations, tailored for diverse experimental requirements. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of the new system by uncovering hidden local and distal inhibitory connections in the mouse hippocampal formation and by imaging the functional properties of a cortical microcircuit across weeks. Our novel production pipeline provides a convenient approach to generate new rabies vectors, while our toolkit flexibly and efficiently expands the current capacity to label, manipulate and image the neuronal activity of interconnected neuronal circuits <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic molecular evolution of a supergene with suppressed recombination in white-throated sparrows</a></h4>

              
                In white-throated sparrows, two alternative morphs differing in plumage and behavior segregate with a large chromosomal rearrangement. As with sex chromosomes such as the mammalian Y, the rearranged version of chromosome two (ZAL2<sup>m</sup>) is in a near-constant state of heterozygosity, offering opportunities to investigate both degenerative and selective processes during the early evolutionary stages of ‘supergenes.’ Here, we generated, synthesized, and analyzed extensive genome-scale data to better understand the forces shaping the evolution of the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes in this species. We found that features of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> are consistent with substantially reduced recombination and low levels of degeneration. We also found evidence that selective sweeps took place both on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and its standard counterpart, ZAL2, after the rearrangement event. Signatures of positive selection were associated with allelic bias in gene expression, suggesting that antagonistic selection has operated on gene regulation. Finally, we discovered a region exhibiting long-range haplotypes inside the rearrangement on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. These haplotypes appear to have been maintained by balancing selection, retaining genetic diversity within the supergene. Together, our analyses illuminate mechanisms contributing to the evolution of a young chromosomal polymorphism, revealing complex selective processes acting concurrently with genetic degeneration to drive the evolution of supergenes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A moonlighting function of a chitin polysaccharide monooxygenase, CWR-1, in Neurospora crassa allorecognition</a></h4>

              
                Organisms require the ability to differentiate themselves from organisms of different or even the same species. Allorecognition processes in filamentous fungi are essential to ensure identity of an interconnected syncytial colony to protect it from exploitation and disease. <i>Neurospora crassa</i> has three cell fusion checkpoints controlling formation of an interconnected mycelial network. The locus that controls the second checkpoint, which allows for cell wall dissolution and subsequent fusion between cells/hyphae, <i>cwr</i> (cell wall remodeling), encodes two linked genes, <i>cwr-1</i> and <i>cwr-2</i>. Previously, it was shown that <i>cwr-1</i> and <i>cwr-2</i> show severe linkage disequilibrium with six different haplogroups present in <i>N. crassa</i> populations. Isolates from an identical <i>cwr</i> haplogroup show robust fusion, while somatic cell fusion between isolates of different haplogroups is significantly blocked in cell wall dissolution. The <i>cwr-1</i> gene encodes a putative polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO). Herein we confirm that CWR-1 is a C1-oxidizing chitin PMO. We show that the catalytic (PMO) domain of CWR-1 was sufficient for checkpoint function and cell fusion blockage; however, through analysis of active-site, histidine-brace mutants, the catalytic activity of CWR-1 was ruled out as a major factor for allorecognition. Swapping a portion of the PMO domain (V86 to T130) did not switch <i>cwr</i> haplogroup specificity, but rather cells containing this chimera exhibited a novel haplogroup specificity. Allorecognition to mediate cell fusion blockage is likely occurring through a protein-protein interaction between CWR-1 with CWR-2. These data highlight a moonlighting role in allorecognition of the CWR-1 PMO domain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuroscout, a unified platform for generalizable and reproducible fMRI research</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized cognitive neuroscience, but methodological barriers limit the generalizability of findings from the lab to the real world. Here, we present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of fMRI studies using naturalistic stimuli-such as movies and narratives-allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition, Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation, Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrating genomic and epidemiologic data to accelerate progress toward schistosomiasis elimination</a></h4>

              
                The global community has adopted ambitious goals to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem, and new tools are needed to achieve them. Mass drug administration programs, for example, have reduced the burden of schistosomiasis, but the identification of hotspots of persistent and reemergent transmission threaten progress toward elimination and underscore the need to couple treatment with interventions that reduce transmission. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies make whole-genome sequencing a valuable and increasingly feasible option for population-based studies of complex parasites such as schistosomes. Here, we focus on leveraging genomic data to tailor interventions to distinct social and ecological circumstances. We consider two priority questions that can be addressed by integrating epidemiological, ecological, and genomic information: (1) how often do non-human host species contribute to human schistosome infection? and (2) what is the importance of locally acquired versus imported infections in driving transmission at different stages of elimination? These questions address processes that can undermine control programs, especially those that rely heavily on treatment with praziquantel. Until recently, these questions were difficult to answer with sufficient precision to inform public health decision-making. We review the literature related to these questions and discuss how whole-genome approaches can identify the geographic and taxonomic sources of infection, and how such information can inform context-specific efforts that advance schistosomiasis control efforts and minimize the risk of reemergence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IL-37 expression reduces acute and chronic neuroinflammation and rescues cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37) belongs to the IL-1 family but is not expressed in mice. We used a human IL‑37 (hIL-37tg) expressing mouse, which has been subjected to various models of local and systemic inflammation as well as immunological challenges. Previous studies reveal an immunomodulatory role of IL-37, which can be characterized as an important suppressor of innate immunity. Here, we examined the functions of IL-37 in the central nervous system and explored the effects of IL-37 on neuronal architecture and function, microglial phenotype, cytokine production and behavior after inflammatory challenge by intraperitoneal LPS-injection. In wild-type mice, decreased spine density, activated microglial phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that expression of IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Notch-dependent transcriptional mechanism controls expression of temporal patterning factors in Drosophila medulla</a></h4>

              
                Temporal patterning is an important mechanism for generating a great diversity of neuron subtypes from a seemingly homogenous progenitor pool in both vertebrates and invertebrates. <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts are temporally patterned by sequentially expressed Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs). These TTFs are proposed to form a transcriptional cascade based on mutant phenotypes, although direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been verified in most cases. Furthermore, it is not known how the temporal transitions are coupled with the generation of the appropriate number of neurons at each stage. We use neuroblasts of the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe medulla to address these questions and show that the expression of TTFs Sloppy-paired 1/2 (Slp1/2) is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by two other TTFs and the cell-cycle dependent Notch signaling through two <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements. We also show that supplying constitutively active Notch can rescue the delayed transition into the Slp stage in cell cycle arrested neuroblasts. Our findings reveal a novel Notch-pathway dependent mechanism through which the cell cycle progression regulates the timing of a temporal transition within a TTF transcriptional cascade.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contribution of behavioural variability to representational drift</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal responses to similar stimuli change dynamically over time, raising the question of how internal representations can provide a stable substrate for neural coding. Recent work has suggested a large degree of drift in neural representations even in sensory cortices, which are believed to store stable representations of the external world. While the drift of these representations is mostly characterized in relation to external stimuli, the behavioural state of the animal (for instance, the level of arousal) is also known to strongly modulate the neural activity. We therefore asked how the variability of such modulatory mechanisms can contribute to representational changes. We analysed large-scale recording of neural activity from the Allen Brain Observatory, which was used before to document representational drift in the mouse visual cortex. We found that, within these datasets, behavioural variability significantly contributes to representational changes. This effect was broadcasted across various cortical areas in the mouse, including the primary visual cortex, higher order visual areas, and even regions not primarily linked to vision like hippocampus. Our computational modelling suggests that these results are consistent with independent modulation of neural activity by behaviour over slower time scales. Importantly, our analysis suggests that reliable but variable modulation of neural representations by behaviour can be misinterpreted as representational drift, if neuronal representations are only characterized in the stimulus space and marginalised over behavioural parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust cone-mediated signaling persists late into rod photoreceptor degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Rod photoreceptor degeneration causes deterioration in the morphology and physiology of cone photoreceptors along with changes in retinal circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision.  However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. To investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression, we used a mouse model of rod degeneration (<i>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></i>). Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia-inducible factor underlies von Hippel-Lindau disease stigmata</a></h4>

              
                von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome that causes a predisposition to renal clear-cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and autosomal-recessive familial polycythemia. pVHL is the substrate conferring subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that binds to the three hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits (HIF1-3α) for polyubiquitylation under conditions of normoxia, targeting them for immediate degradation by the proteasome. Certain mutations in pVHL have been determined to be causative of VHL disease through the disruption of HIFα degradation. However, it remains a focus of investigation and debate whether the disruption of HIFα degradation alone is sufficient to explain the complex genotype-phenotype relationship of VHL disease or whether the other lesser or yet characterized substrates and functions of pVHL impact the development of the VHL disease stigmata; the elucidation of which would have a significant ramification to the direction of research efforts and future management and care of VHL patients and for those manifesting sporadic counterparts of VHL disease. Here, we examine the current literature including the other emergent pseudohypoxic diseases and propose that the VHL disease-phenotypic spectrum could be explained solely by the varied disruption of HIFα signaling upon the loss or mutation in pVHL.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transition to siblinghood causes a substantial and long-lasting increase in urinary cortisol levels in wild bonobos</a></h4>

              
                In animals with slow ontogeny and long-term maternal investment, immatures are likely to experience the birth of a younger sibling before reaching maturity. In these species, the birth of a sibling marks a major event in an offspring's early life, as the older siblings experience a decrease in maternal support. The transition to siblinghood (TTS) is often considered to be stressful for the older offspring, but physiological evidence is lacking. To explore the TTS in wild bonobos, we investigated physiological changes in urinary cortisol (stress response), neopterin (cell-mediated immunity), and total triiodothyronine (T3, metabolic rate), as well as changes in behaviors that reflect the mother-offspring relationship. Following a sibling's birth, urinary cortisol levels of the older offspring increased fivefold, independent of their age, and remained elevated for seven months. The cortisol level increase was associated with declining neopterin levels, however T3 levels and behavioral measures did not change. Our results indicate that the TTS is accompanied by elevated cortisol levels and that this change does not coincide with nutritional weaning and attainment of physical independence. Our results suggest that bonobos and humans experience TTS in similar ways and that this developmental event may have emerged in the last common ancestor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The scaffolding protein Flot2 promotes cytoneme-based transport of Wnt3 in gastric cancer</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway regulates multiple cellular processes during development and many diseases, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Despite their hydrophobic nature, Wnt proteins exert their function over long distances to induce paracrine signalling. Recent studies have identified several factors involved in Wnt secretion, however, our understanding of how Wnt ligands are transported between cells to interact with their cognate receptors is still debated. Here, we demonstrate that gastric cancer cells utilise cytonemes to transport Wnt3 intercellularly to promote proliferation and cell survival. Furthermore, we identify the membrane-bound scaffolding protein Flotillin-2 (Flot2), frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer, as a modulator of these cytonemes. Together with the Wnt co-receptor and cytoneme initiator Ror2, Flot2 determines the number and length of Wnt3 cytonemes in gastric cancer. Finally, we show that Flotillins are also necessary for Wnt8a cytonemes during zebrafish embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for Flotillin-mediated Wnt transport on cytonemes in development and disease.

	<p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor academic performance also among university students. This relationship may be made more complex by comorbid conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mediating role of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the relationship between ADHD and academic performance. Data were drawn from the CAMPUS study (registration number: 0058642/21), an ongoing survey on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; mental health. Using a logit model, mediation analyses were carried out to test whether the relationship between ADHD symptoms (assessed by ASRS-5) and academic performance might be mediated by depressive (assessed by PHQ-9) and anxiety (assessed by GAD-7) symptoms. Our results showed that worse academic performance is associated with ADHD symptoms (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, about 24% of the overall association between ADHD symptoms and academic performance was mediated by depressive symptoms (indirect effect: 0.065, 95%CI 0.022; 0.100), whereas the contribution of anxiety symptoms to the model was not significant. Along with the association between ADHD symptoms and poor academic performance, our findings highlight the key mediating role of depressive symptoms, which may be targeted with tailored support, ultimately improving both the academic performance and the well-being of university students with ADHD.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor that regulates T-cell autocrine secretion and has long been considered to be closely related to immune response. With the advance in neuroinflammation theory and immunology research on schizophrenia, it is interesting and meaningful to discuss the possible role of IL-2 in schizophrenia. Here, we reviewed a series of studies published from the 1990s and found that IL-2 was closely associated with schizophrenia. For example, IL-2 is responsible for mediating toxic reactions, which are the causes of schizophrenia symptoms in patients, and such symptoms resolve after discontinuation of the drug. In addition, we focused on the changes of IL-2 in the onset, progression and treatment of schizophrenia and the possible mechanisms by which IL-2 affects schizophrenia. Our review suggests that IL-2 is associated with schizophrenia and plays a role in its pathogenesis, and progression IL-2 and sIL-2R could serve as potential biomarkers of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum is particularly enriched in antigens and represents a vulnerable target to immune attacks. Immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs) have diverse etiologies, such as gluten ataxia (GA), post-infectious cerebellitis (PIC), Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), and anti-GAD ataxia. Apart from these well-established entities, cerebellar ataxia (CA) occurs also in association with autoimmunity against ion channels and related proteins, synaptic adhesion/organizing proteins, transmitter receptors, glial cells, as well as the brainstem antigens. Most of these conditions manifest diverse neurological clinical features, with CAs being one of the main clinical phenotypes. The term primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) refers to ataxic conditions suspected to be autoimmune even in the absence of specific well-characterized pathogenic antibody markers. We review advances in the field of IMCAs and propose a clinical approach for the understanding and diagnosis of IMCAs, focusing on rare etiologies which are likely underdiagnosed. The frontiers of PACA are discussed. The identification of rare immune ataxias is of importance since they are potentially treatable and may lead to a severe clinical syndrome in absence of early therapy.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in young adults from a neurology clinic-based cohort (&amp;amp;le;45 years old) via unenhanced brain MRI. (2) Methods: A total of 931 young adults from a neurology clinic-based cohort who underwent unenhanced brain MRI between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021 were retrospectively included in this study. The EPVS were rated in the centrum semiovale (CSO-EPVS), basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), and midbrain (MB-EPVS) using a visual rating scale. The degrees of the CSO-EPVS, BG-EPVS, and MB-EPVS were all divided by a cutoff value of 1. Demographic factors, vascular risk factors, and symptoms were analyzed using the chi-square test and logistic regression to determine the risk factors of EPVS. (3) Results: The overall prevalence of EPVS was 99.8% (929/931). The CSO-EPVS, BG-EPVS, and MB-EPVS were predominantly scored as 1 (52.1%, 79.1%, and 58.3%, respectively). Logistic regression analysis identified age and hypertension as factors affecting the degrees of CSO-EPVS and BG-EPVS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Hypertension (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and diabetes (p = 0.014) were revealed to be factors affecting the degree of BG-EPVS. Furthermore, patients with headache (OR = 1.807; p = 0.001) and dizziness (OR = 1.574; p = 0.025) were associated with MB-EPVS. (4) Conclusions: EPVS were frequently found in young adults and could be related to the symptoms. Age, hypertension, and diabetes were the risk factors for the severity of EPVS in the corresponding brain regions.</p>

	<p>Procrastination is defined as putting off an intended course of action voluntarily despite the harmful consequences. Previous studies have suggested that procrastination is associated with punishment sensitivity in that high punishment sensitivity results in increased negative utility for task performance. We hypothesized the effects of punishment sensitivity on procrastination would be mediated by a network connecting the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex, both of which have been previously associated with self-control and emotional control during procrastination. We employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) to examine the neural substrates of punishment sensitivity and its relationship with procrastination (N = 268). The behavioral results indicated a strong positive correlation between measures of punishment sensitivity and procrastination. The VBM analysis revealed that the gray matter (GM) volume of the right caudate was significantly positively correlated with punishment sensitivity. The primary rsFC analysis revealed connectivity between this caudate location and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) was significantly negatively correlated with punishment sensitivity. A mediation model indicated punishment sensitivity completely mediated the relation between functional connectivity within a caudate&amp;amp;ndash;bilateral MFG network and procrastination. Our results support the theory that those with higher punishment sensitivity have weaker effective emotional self-control supported by the caudate&amp;amp;ndash;MFG network, resulting in greater procrastination.</p>

	<p>There has been an increase in the use of mechanical ventilation (MV) in motor neurone disease (MND) to alleviate symptoms related to hypoventilation. Little is known about its use at the end of life, and the withdrawal of MV is a challenging topic. A scoping review was conducted to map the existing evidence of ventilation use at the end of life in MND. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework was used, and a total of 31 documents were included in the data extraction. Boarder themes around place, planning, cause and comments on death were identified. Our findings show that the focus of the literature has been on the process of the withdrawal of ventilation, creating the subthemes of timing and reason for withdrawal, along with ethical, emotional, and practical issues, medications used and the time until death. There is a foundation of evidence to guide the process and discuss the ethical and emotional issues of withdrawing ventilation. However, there remains limited evidence from patient and family member perspectives. Importantly, there is almost no evidence exploring dying with ventilation in place, the active or passive decisions around this process, how the interface might impact the dying process, or what families think about this.</p>

	<p>Emotion analysis has emerged as one of the most prominent study areas in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) due to the critical role that the human brain plays in the creation of human emotions. In this study, a Multi-objective Immunogenetic Community Division Algorithm Based on Memetic Framework (MFMICD) was suggested to study different emotions from the perspective of brain networks. To improve convergence and accuracy, MFMICD incorporates the unique immunity operator based on the traditional genetic algorithm and combines it with the taboo search algorithm. Based on this approach, we examined how the structure of people&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain networks alters in response to different emotions using the electroencephalographic emotion database. The findings revealed that, in positive emotional states, more brain regions are engaged in emotion dominance, the information exchange between local modules is more frequent, and various emotions cause more varied patterns of brain area interactions than in negative brain states. A brief analysis of the connections between different emotions and brain regions shows that MFMICD is reliable in dividing emotional brain functional networks into communities.</p>

	<p>Introduction: It is clear that mental fatigue can have many negative impacts on individuals, such as impairing cognitive function or affecting performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of sound interventions in combating mental fatigue. Method: The subjects were assessed on various scales, a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) task, and a 3 min resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG), followed by a 20 min mental fatigue&amp;amp;ndash;inducing task (Time Load Dual Back, TloadDback), during which subjects in different condition groups listened to either 15 Hz binaural beats, 40 Hz binaural beats, relaxing music, or a 240 Hz pure tone. After the mental fatigue&amp;amp;ndash;inducing task, subjects were again assessed on various scales, a PVT task, and a 3 min resting-state EEG. Results: After the fatigue-inducing task, there was no significant difference between the four groups on the scales or the PVT task performance. In TloadDback, the accuracy rate of the 40 Hz binaural beats group and the relaxing music group decreased in the middle stage of the task, while the 15 Hz binaural beats group and the 240 Hz pure tone group remained unchanged in all stages of the task. The EEG results showed that after fatigue inducement, the average path length of the 15 Hz binaural beats group decreased, and local efficiency showed an increasing tendency, indicating enhanced brain network connectivity. Meanwhile, the 240 Hz pure tone group showed enhanced functional connectivity, suggesting a state of mental fatigue in the group. Conclusions: The results of this study show that listening to 15 Hz binaural beats is a proven intervention for mental fatigue that can contribute to maintaining working memory function, enhancing brain topological structure, and alleviating the decline in brain function that occurs in a mentally fatigued state. As such, these results are of great scientific and practical value.</p>

	<p>Tennis experts need to extract effective visual information from a sphere in high-speed motion, in which motion-in-depth perception plays an important role. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of sphere speed and tennis expertise on motion-in-depth perception by using the expert&amp;amp;ndash;novice task paradigm along with event-related potential (ERP) technology. The study also explored differences in behavior and electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics between tennis experts and novices. Results show that faster sphere movement led to shorter response times and a lower accuracy rate. The P1 component in the occipital&amp;amp;ndash;temporal region showed that the expert group activated earlier and were stronger when the sphere was far away. The latent period of P2 in the occipital region was significantly shorter in the expert group in comparison to the novice group. Faster speed led to the induction of increased P300 volatility and a significant increase in latency. The findings of the current study show that the speed of the sphere movement affects the invocation and allocation of cognitive resources in the process of motion-in-depth perception, irrespective of whether the athletes were experts or novices. There is a special effect in the process of motion-in-depth perception for experts, mainly because attention resources are invested earlier in experts rather than novices.</p>

	<p>Background: Systematic reviews conducted on sleep disturbances in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have found inconsistent results due to the presence of several moderating variables which were not controlled for in previous studies. The aim of this study was to examine sleep disturbances in children with ADHD compared to their typically developing peers after controlling for moderating variables (age, sex, medication status, body mass index, and psychiatric and medical comorbidities). Methods: ADHD was diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and Conners&amp;amp;rsquo; Parent Rating Scales. Children recruited (aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) for the ADHD group (n = 40) met the following criteria: IQ &amp;amp;gt; 80, unmedicated, and no psychiatric or medical comorbidities. The control group consisted of age- and sex-matched typically developing peers (n = 40). Sleep was assessed subjectively (through parent reported questionnaires and sleep logs) and objectively (using video polysomnography). Results: 65% of children with ADHD had a sleep disorder, as compared to 17% of controls. The ADHD group reported more sleep disturbances and disorders, both on subjective measures and objective measures. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances and primary sleep disorders in children with ADHD exist independent of moderating variables and differences in sleep assessment methods, thereby bolstering support for previously documented literature on the ADHD and sleep connection.</p>

	<p>MiR-223 is a miRNA with important functions in apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, and it was demonstrated to be over-expressed in brain tissue after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, few studies have focused on its role in protecting brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). This study evaluated the protective effect of miR-223 on BMECs after stretch injury (SI). bEnd.3 cells (BMECs of mouse) were transfected with overexpressing and blocking lentivirus of miR-223, then were subjected to SI. After immunofluorescence assay, it was demonstrated that miR-223 overexpression significantly rescued the SI-induced loss of ZO-1 (Zonula Occludens 1, tight junction protein) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while miR-223 blocking exacerbated the loss of ZO-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Flow cytometry confirmed a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic bEnd.3 cells after SI, and miR-223 overexpression reduced this proportion (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The result of Western blot revealed that miR-223 overexpression significantly reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (cl-caspase 3) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and RhoB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while miR-223 blocking increased the expression of these proteins (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, knockdown of RhoB significantly reduced the expression of cl-caspase 3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggested that miR-223 can alleviate SI-induced apoptosis of BMECs, and this anti-apoptotic effect is at least partially achieved by inhibiting the expression of RhoB. Moreover, miR-223 may play a role in maintaining the integrity of BBB during TBI.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a multifactorial neurological disorder with recurrent epileptic seizures. Current research stresses both inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as enablers in the pathophysiological process of epilepsy. In view of the growing concern about the role of adipocytokines in antiepileptic and modulating immune responses, we aimed to investigate the relevance of the adipocytokine signaling pathway in the pathological process of epilepsy and its impacts on peripheral immune characteristics. In this study, expression profiles of 142 peripheral blood samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Adipocytokine pathway-related genes were screened out by feature selection using machine-learning algorithms. A nomogram was then constructed and estimated for the efficacy of diagnosis. Cluster analysis was employed for the recognization of two distinct epilepsy subtypes, followed by an estimation of the immune cell infiltration levels using single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The biological characteristics were analyzed by functional enrichment analysis. The aberrant regulation of adipocytokine signaling pathway was found in the peripheral blood of patients with epilepsy. Twenty-one differently expressed adipocytokine pathway-related genes were identified and five (RELA, PRKAB1, TNFRSF1A, CAMKK2, and CPT1B) were selected to construct a nomogram. Subsequent validations of its forecasting ability revealed that this model has satisfactory predictive value. The immune cell infiltration degrees, such as those of innate immune cells and lymphocytes, were found to significantly correlate to the levels of adipocytokine pathway-related genes. Additionally, 239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and their biological functions were mainly enriched in the regulation of the immune response. In conclusion, our results confirmed the predictive value of adipocytokine pathway-related genes for epilepsy and explored their effects on immune infiltration, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy and providing assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral Forgetting of Olfactory Learning Is Mediated by Interneuron-Regulated Network Plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forgetting is important for animals to manage acquired memories to enable adaptation to changing environments; however, the neural network in mechanisms of forgetting is not fully understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying forgetting, we examined olfactory adaptation, a form of associative learning, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. The forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation in <I>C. elegans</I> is regulated by secreted signals from AWC sensory neurons via the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. These signals cause a decline of the sensory memory trace in AWA neurons, where diacetyl is mainly sensed. To further understand the neural network that regulates this forgetting, we investigated the function of interneurons downstream of AWA and AWC neurons. We found that a pair of interneurons, AIA, is indispensable for the proper regulation of behavioral forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation. Loss or inactivation of AIA caused the impairment of the chemotaxis recovery after adaptation without causing severe chemotaxis defects in the naive animal. AWA Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses suggested that loss or inactivation of AIA interneurons did not affect the decline of the sensory memory trace after the recovery. Furthermore, AIA responses to diacetyl were observed in naive animals and after the recovery, but not just after the conditioning, suggesting that AIA responses after the recovery are required for the chemotaxis to diacetyl. We propose that the functional neuronal circuit for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl is changed temporally at the recovery phase so that AIA interneurons are required for chemotaxis, although AIAs are dispensable for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl in naive animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordination between Eye Movement and Whisking in Head-Fixed Mice Navigating a Plus Maze</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Navigation through complex environments requires motor planning, motor preparation, and the coordination between multiple sensory&ndash;motor modalities. For example, the stepping motion when we walk is coordinated with motion of the torso, arms, head, and eyes. In rodents, movement of the animal through the environment is coordinated with whisking. Even head-fixed mice navigating a plus maze position their whiskers asymmetrically with the bilateral asymmetry signifying the upcoming turn direction. Here we report that, in addition to moving their whiskers, on every trial mice also move their eyes conjugately in the direction of the upcoming turn. Not only do mice move their eyes, but they coordinate saccadic eye movement with the asymmetric positioning of the whiskers. Our analysis shows that asymmetric positioning of whiskers predicted the turn direction that mice will make at an earlier stage than eye movement. Consistent with these results, our observations also revealed that whisker asymmetry increases before saccadic eye movement. Importantly, this work shows that when rodents plan for active behavior, their motor plans can involve both eye and whisker movement. We conclude that, when mice are engaged in and moving through complex real-world environments, their behavioral state can be read out in the movement of both their whiskers and eyes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A novel logical model of COVID-19 intracellular infection to support therapies development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elena Piretto, Gianluca Selvaggio, Damiano Bragantini, Enrico Domenici, Luca Marchetti</p>

In this paper, a logical-based mathematical model of the cellular pathways involved in the COVID-19 infection has been developed to study various drug treatments (single or in combination), in different illness scenarios, providing insights into their mechanisms of action. Drug simulations suggest that the effects of single drugs are limited, or depending on the scenario counterproductive, whereas better results appear combining different treatments. Specifically, the combination of the anti-inflammatory Baricitinib and the anti-viral Remdesivir showed significant benefits while a stronger efficacy emerged from the triple combination of Baricitinib, Remdesivir, and the corticosteroid Dexamethasone. Together with a sensitivity analysis, we performed an analysis of the mechanisms of the drugs to reveal their impact on molecular pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mapping of promoter usage QTL using RNA-seq data reveals their contributions to complex traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naoto Kubota, Mikita Suyama</p>

Genomic variations are associated with gene expression levels, which are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Most eQTL may affect the total gene expression levels by regulating transcriptional activities of a specific promoter. However, the direct exploration of genomic loci associated with promoter activities using RNA-seq data has been challenging because eQTL analyses treat the total expression levels estimated by summing those of all isoforms transcribed from distinct promoters. Here we propose a new method for identifying genomic loci associated with promoter activities, called promoter usage quantitative trait loci (puQTL), using conventional RNA-seq data. By leveraging public RNA-seq datasets from the lymphoblastoid cell lines of 438 individuals from the GEUVADIS project, we obtained promoter activity estimates and mapped 2,592 puQTL at the 10% FDR level. The results of puQTL mapping enabled us to interpret the manner in which genomic variations regulate gene expression. We found that 310 puQTL genes (16.1%) were not detected by eQTL analysis, suggesting that our pipeline can identify novel variant–gene associations. Furthermore, we identified genomic loci associated with the activity of “hidden” promoters, which the standard eQTL studies have ignored. We found that most puQTL signals were concordant with at least one genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal, enabling novel interpretations of the molecular mechanisms of complex traits. Our results emphasize the importance of the re-analysis of public RNA-seq datasets to obtain novel insights into gene regulation by genomic variations and their contributions to complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accounting for multiple imputation-induced variability for differential analysis in mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Chion, Christine Carapito, Frédéric Bertrand</p>

Imputing missing values is common practice in label-free quantitative proteomics. Imputation aims at replacing a missing value with a user-defined one. However, the imputation itself may not be optimally considered downstream of the imputation process, as imputed datasets are often considered as if they had always been complete. Hence, the uncertainty due to the imputation is not adequately taken into account. We provide a rigorous multiple imputation strategy, leading to a less biased estimation of the parameters’ variability thanks to Rubin’s rules. The imputation-based peptide’s intensities’ variance estimator is then moderated using Bayesian hierarchical models. This estimator is finally included in moderated <i>t</i>-test statistics to provide differential analyses results. This workflow can be used both at peptide and protein-level in quantification datasets. Indeed, an aggregation step is included for protein-level results based on peptide-level quantification data. Our methodology, named mi4p, was compared to the state-of-the-art limma workflow implemented in the DAPAR R package, both on simulated and real datasets. We observed a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, while the overall performance of mi4p outperforms DAPAR in terms of <i>F</i>-Score.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-objective based clustering for inferring BCR clonal lineages from high-throughput B cell repertoire data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nika Abdollahi, Lucile Jeusset, Anne Langlois De Septenville, Hugues Ripoche, Frédéric Davi, Juliana Silva Bernardes</p>

The adaptive B cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clonal lineages. A high number of clonal lineages in a B cell population indicates a highly diverse repertoire, while clonal size distribution and sequence diversity antigen selective pressure. Identifying clonal lineages is fundamental to many repertoire studies, including repertoire comparisons, clonal tracking, and statistical analysis. Several methods have been developed to group sequences from high-throughput B cell repertoire data. Current methods use clustering algorithms to group clonally-related sequences based on their similarities or distances. Such approaches create groups by optimizing a single objective that typically minimizes intra-clonal distances. However, optimizing several objective functions can be advantageous and boost the algorithm convergence rate. Here we propose a new method based on multi-objective clustering. Our approach requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial groups and iteratively applies two objective functions that optimize cohesion and separation within clonal lineages simultaneously. We show that our method greatly improves clonal lineage grouping on simulated benchmarks with varied mutation rates compared to other tools. When applied to experimental repertoires generated from high-throughput sequencing, its clustering results are comparable to the most performing tools and can reproduce the results of previous publications. The method based on multi-objective clustering can accurately identify clonally-related antibody sequences and presents the lowest running time among state-of-art tools. All these features constitute an attractive option for repertoire analysis, particularly in the clinical context. MobiLLe can potentially help unravel the mechanisms involved in developing and evolving B cell malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A simple model of the attentional blink and its modulation by mental training</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadav Amir, Naftali Tishby, Israel Nelken</p>

The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced probability of reporting a second target (T2) that appears shortly after a first one (T1) within a rapidly presented sequence of distractors. The AB effect has been shown to be reduced following intensive mental training in the form of mindfulness meditation, with a corresponding reduction in T1-evoked P3b brain potentials. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. We propose a dynamical-systems model of the AB, in which attentional load is described as the response of a dynamical system to incoming impulse signals. Non-task related mental activity is represented by additive noise modulated by meditation. The model provides a parsimonious computational framework relating behavioral performance, evoked brain potentials and training through the concept of reduced mental noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale modelling of desquamation in the interfollicular epidermis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claire Miller, Edmund Crampin, James M. Osborne</p>

Maintenance of epidermal thickness is critical to the barrier function of the skin. Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is related to several severe diseases of the tissue. In order to maintain both stratum corneum thickness and overall tissue thickness it is necessary for the system to balance cell proliferation and cell loss. Cell proliferation in the epidermis occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in the tissue. Cell loss occurs when dead cells at the top of the tissue are lost to the environment through a process called desquamation. Desquamation is thought to occur through a gradual reduction in adhesion between cells, due to the cleaving of adhesion proteins by enzymes, in the stratum corneum.
In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model of desquamation with a three dimensional (cell centre based) multicellular model of the interfollicular epidermis to better understand maintenance of epidermal thickness. Specifically, our aim is to determine if a hypothesised biological model for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion, from the literature, is sufficient to maintain a steady state tissue thickness. These investigations show the model is able to provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model. This loss balances proliferation, and hence maintains a homeostatic tissue thickness. Moreover, we find that multiple proliferative cell populations in the basal layer can be represented by a single proliferative cell population, simplifying investigations with this model.
The model is used to investigate a disorder (Netherton Syndrome) which disrupts desquamation. The model shows how biochemical changes can cause disruptions to the tissue, resulting in a reduced tissue thickness and consequently diminishing the protective role of the tissue. A hypothetical treatment result is also investigated: we compare the cases of a partially effective homogeneous treatment (where all cells partially recover) and a totally effective heterogeneous treatment (in which a proportion of the cells totally recover) with the aim to determine the difference in the response of the tissue to these different scenarios. Results show an increased benefit to corneum thickness from the heterogeneous treatment over the homogeneous treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-fitted instrument: A blueprint for one-sample Mendelian randomization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William R. P. Denault, Jon Bohlin, Christian M. Page, Stephen Burgess, Astanand Jugessur</p>

Bias from weak instruments may undermine the ability to estimate causal effects in instrumental variable regression (IVR). We present here a new approach to handling weak instrument bias through the application of a new type of instrumental variable coined ‘Cross-Fitted Instrument’ (CFI). CFI splits the data at random and estimates the impact of the instrument on the exposure in each partition. These estimates are then used to perform an IVR on each partition. We adapt CFI to the Mendelian randomization (MR) setting and term this adaptation ‘Cross-Fitting for Mendelian Randomization’ (CFMR). We show that, even when using weak instruments, CFMR is, at worst, biased towards the null, which makes it a conservative one-sample MR approach. In particular, CFMR remains conservative even when the two samples used to perform the MR analysis completely overlap, whereas current state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., MR RAPS) display substantial bias in this setting. Another major advantage of CFMR lies in its use of all of the available data to select genetic instruments, which maximizes statistical power, as opposed to traditional two-sample MR where only part of the data is used to select the instrument. Consequently, CFMR is able to enhance statistical power in consortia-led meta-analyses by enabling a conservative one-sample MR to be performed in each cohort prior to a meta-analysis of the results across all the cohorts. In addition, CFMR enables a cross-ethnic MR analysis by accounting for ethnic heterogeneity, which is particularly important in meta-analyses where the participating cohorts may have different ethnicities. To our knowledge, none of the current MR approaches can account for such heterogeneity. Finally, CFMR enables the application of MR to exposures that are either rare or difficult to measure, which would normally preclude their analysis in the regular two-sample MR setting.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]-flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to compare FTLD to cases with high and low levels of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (ADNC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred forty-three participants who had completed at least one flortaucipir PET and had autopsy-confirmed FTLD (n = 52) or high (n = 58) or low ADNC (n = 33) based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0–IV versus V–VI were included. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for 9 regions of interest (ROIs): an FTLD meta-ROI, midbrain, globus pallidum, an AD meta-ROI, entorhinal, inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, precentral, and medial parietal. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare mean baseline SUVRs and annual rate of change in SUVR by group. Sensitivity and specificity to distinguish FTLD from high and low ADNC were calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline uptake in the FTLD meta-ROI, midbrain, and globus pallidus was greater in FTLD than high and low ADNC. No region showed a greater rate of flortaucipir accumulation in FTLD. Baseline uptake in the AD-related regions and orbitofrontal and precentral cortices was greater in high ADNC, and all showed greater rates of accumulation compared to FTLD. Baseline differences were superior to longitudinal rates in differentiating FTLD from high and low ADNC. A simple baseline metric of midbrain/inferior temporal ratio of flortaucipir uptake provided good to excellent differentiation between FTLD and high and low ADNC (sensitivities/specificities = 94%/95% and 71%/70%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in flortaucipir uptake between FTLD and high and low ADNC. However, optimum differentiation between FTLD and ADNC was achieved with baseline uptake rather than longitudinal rates. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>Across 759 patients, average MCA-PI during monitoring was associated with lower HR and diastolic BP (DBP) and greater systolic BP (SBP) (∆MCA-PI per 10 bpm/mmHg: −0.02, −0.04, 0.03, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with HR particularly associated with low end-diastolic cerebral velocity (0.86, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Beat-to-beat HR was strongly associated with concurrent low DBP and high SBP, potentially mediating the association with greater beat-to-beat cerebral pulsatility (average ∆MCA-PI vs HR/DBP/SBP unadjusted: −0.062, −0.052, 0.0092; adjusted for concurrent BP: −0.039, −0.11, 0.041). The beat-to-beat association between HR and MCA-PI increased with age, beta-blockers, arterial stiffness, low HR (age &gt; 70 + HR &lt; 65 vs age &lt; 70 + HR &gt; 65: −0.081 vs −0.024, interaction <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and severe SVD on MRI (age &gt; 70 + severe vs age &lt; 70 + none: −0.087 vs −0.047, interaction <i>p</i> = 0.03), with interactions between age, severe SVD, and low HR synergistically increasing MCA-PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Low HR is associated with greater cerebral pulsatility in patients with SVD, potentially mediated by lower diastolic blood flow and representing a novel potential treatment target. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>Development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the PGN of the cat.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus receives axons from the thalamic sensory nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons in the parabrachial region are a subset of <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons that do not express <i>Pdyn</i>, <i>Calca</i>, or <i>Cck</i>. We also identified novel populations of NPS neurons from Cre-reporter expression in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. 

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

                Chowdhury et al. discovered a neuromodulatory pathway for linking memories that does not affect memory formation. They demonstrate that locus coeruleus (LC)-dCA1-projecting neurons specifically regulate memory linking in a dopamine-dependent manner by modulating the excitability of dCA1 neurons and the extent of overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles.

This synergizes with previous Helmholtzian accounts of perception and also offers a more comprehensive computational and algorithmic treatment of perceptual dynamics in healthy and psychiatric populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel cognitive maps for short-term statistical and long-term semantic relationships in the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal-entorhinal system uses cognitive maps to represent spatial knowledge and other types of relational information, such as the transition probabilities between objects. However, objects can often be characterized in terms of different types of relations simultaneously, e.g. semantic similarities learned over the course of a lifetime as well as transitions experienced over a brief timeframe in an experimental setting. Here we ask how the hippocampal formation handles the embedding of stimuli in multiple relational structures that differ vastly in terms of their mode and timescale of acquisition: Does it integrate the different stimulus dimensions into one conjunctive map, or is each dimension represented in a parallel map? To this end, we reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Garvert et al. (2017) that had previously revealed an entorhinal map which coded for newly learnt statistical regularities. We used a triplet odd-one-out task to construct a semantic distance matrix for presented items and applied fMRI adaptation analysis to show that the degree of similarity of representations in bilateral hippocampus decreases as a function of semantic distance between presented objects. Importantly, while both maps localize to the hippocampal formation, this semantic map is anatomically distinct from the originally described entorhinal map. This finding supports the idea that the hippocampal-entorhinal system forms parallel cognitive maps reflecting the embedding of objects in diverse relational structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus Coeruleus firing patterns selectively modulate brain activity and dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Noradrenaline (NA) release from the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) changes activity and connectivity in neuronal networks across the brain, thus modulating multiple behavioural states. NA release is mediated by both tonic and burst-like neuronal LC activity. However, it remains unknown whether the functional changes in downstream projection areas depend on these firing patterns. Using optogenetics, pupillometry, photometry, and functional MRI in mice, we show that tonic and burst LC firing patterns elicit brain responses that are specific to the activation frequency and temporal pattern. Tonic activation of the LC evokes nonlinear responses in prefrontal, limbic, and cerebellar regions, in line with the proposed inverted-U relationship between LC activity and behaviour. We further demonstrate that LC activity enhances network integration and acts as a facilitator of brain state transitions, hence increasing brain flexibility. Together, these findings reveal how the LC-NA system achieves a nuanced regulation of global circuit operations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural signature of magnitude integration between time and numerosity</a></h4>

              
                Magnitude dimensions such as time and numerosity are fundamental components of our visual experience, allowing us to understand the environment and interact with it. Different magnitudes are however not processed independently from each other, but show a relationship whereby the perception of one dimension depends on the others (magnitude integration). In this study, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to address whether such integration may arise from a shared brain processing stage where different dimensions are integrated together, or from independent parallel processes interfering with each other. In the experiment, participants judged either the average numerosity or duration of dynamic dot-array stimuli concurrently modulated in both dimensions. First, the behavioural results show a magnitude integration effect in both tasks, with duration affecting the judgement of numerosity and vice versa. The EEG results further show that both numerosity and duration significantly modulate event-related potentials at several distinct latencies. Crucially, however, we identified a significant interaction between numerosity and duration emerging in a specific latency window (360-460 ms) irrespective of the task performed by participants. In this latency window, the modulation of ERPs provided by the interfering magnitude dimension can be predicted by the strength of the behavioural bias. Our results thus support the idea of different magnitude dimensions converging onto a shared perceptual processing stage mediating their integration. Overall, our results demonstrate a clear electrophysiological signature of magnitude integration between numerosity and time, and provide new evidence for a shared representational system encompassing different magnitude dimensions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel streams of raphe VGLUT3-positive inputs target the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in each hemisphere.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus (HP) receives neurochemically diverse inputs from the raphe nuclei, including glutamatergic fibers characterized by the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3. These raphe-HP VGLUT3 (VGLUT3HP) projections have been suggested to play a critical role in HP functions, yet a complete anatomical overview of raphe VGLUT3 projections to the forebrain, and in particular the HP, is lacking. Using anterograde viral tracing, we describe largely non-overlapping VGLUT3-positive projections from the dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MnR) to the forebrain, with the HP receiving inputs from the MnR. A limited subset of forebrain regions such as the amygdaloid complex, claustrum and hypothalamus receive projections from both the DR and MnR that remain largely segregated. This highly complementary anatomical pattern suggests contrasting roles for DR and MnR VGLUT3 neurons. To further analyse the topography of VGLUT3 raphe projections to the HP, we used retrograde tracing and found that VGLUT3HP neurons distribute over several raphe sub-regions (including the MnR, paramedian raphe and B9 nucleus) and lack co-expression of serotonergic markers. Strikingly, two-color retrograde tracing unraveled two parallel streams of VGLUT3-positive projections targeting the dorsal and ventral poles of the HP. These results demonstrate highly organized and segregated VGLUT3-positive projections to the HP, suggesting independent modulation of HP functions such as spatial memory and emotion-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Expression of TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 in the Mouse Spinal Cord Determined Using Super-Resolution Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Cellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) are a key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterised by a loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord that is preceded by early-stage changes in synaptic function that may be associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, there has been little characterisation of the synaptic expression of TDP-43 in spinal cord synapses. This study utilises a range of high-resolution and super-resolution microscopy techniques with immunolabelling, as well as an aptamer-based TDP-43 labelling strategy visualised with single-molecule localisation microscopy, to characterise and quantify the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) in spinal cord synapses. We observe that TDP-43 is expressed in the majority of spinal cord synapses as nanoscale clusters as small as 60 nm in diameter. Synaptic TDP-43 expression is more frequently associated with presynaptic terminals than postsynaptic densities, and is more enriched in VGLUT1-associated synapses, compared to VGLUT2-associated synapses. Our nanoscopy techniques showed no difference in the subsynaptic expression of pTDP-43 in the ALS mouse model, SOD1G93a compared to healthy controls. This research characterizes the basic synaptic expression of TDP-43 with nanoscale precision and provides a framework with which to investigate the potential relationship between TDP-43 pathology and synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HP1 deficiency results in De-Repression of Endogenous Retroviruses and Induction of Neurodegeneration via Complement</a></h4>

              
                In aging cells and animal models of premature aging, heterochromatin loss coincides with the transcriptional activation of normally silenced endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here we show that loss of heterochromatin maintenance and de-repression of ERVs results in neurodegeneration via the Complement cascade in an age dependent manner. We discovered differential contributions of HP1 proteins to ERV silencing where HP1{gamma} is necessary and sufficient for H4K20me3 deposition and HP1{beta} deficiency is detrimental to DNA maintenance methylation. Progressive ERV de-repression in HP1{beta}/{gamma} DKO mice was followed by stimulation of the integrated stress response, the induction of Complement 3+ reactive astrocytes and increased infiltration and activation of microglia. This chronic inflammatory state coincided with age-dependent reductions in dendrite complexity and cognition. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing loss of epigenetic maintenance, as this will be the only way postmitotic neuronal genomes can be protected and/or renewed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian distribution of epileptiform discharges in epilepsy: candidate mechanisms of variability</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder characterised by a tendency to have recurrent, spontaneous, seizures. Classically, seizures are assumed to occur at random. However, recent research has uncovered underlying rhythms both in seizures and in key signatures of epilepsy - so-called interictal epileptiform activity - with timescales that vary from hours and days through to months. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that determine these rhythmic patterns of epileptiform discharges remains an open question. Many people with epilepsy identify precipitants of their seizures, the most common of which include stress, sleep deprivation and fatigue. To quantify the impact of these physiological factors, we analysed 24-hour EEG recordings from a cohort of 107 people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We found two subgroups with distinct distributions of epileptiform discharges: one with highest incidence during sleep and the other during day-time. We interrogated these data using a mathematical model that describes the transitions between background and epileptiform activity in large-scale brain networks. This model was extended to include a time-dependent forcing term, where the excitability of nodes within the network could be modulated by other factors. We calibrated this forcing term using independently-collected human cortisol (the primary stress-responsive hormone characterised by circadian and ultradian patterns of secretion) data and sleep-staged EEG from healthy human participants. We found that either the dynamics of cortisol or sleep stage transition, or a combination of both, could explain most of the observed distributions of epileptiform discharges. Our findings provide conceptual evidence for the existence of underlying physiological drivers of rhythms of epileptiform discharges. These findings should motivate future research to explore these mechanisms in carefully designed experiments using animal models or people with epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small Training Dataset Convolutional Neural Networks for Application Specific Super-Resolution Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to significantly increase microscopy resolution, speed (signal-to-noise ratio), and data interpretation. The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. This paper demonstrates how adding a dense encoder-decoder block can be useful to effectively train a CNN that provides super-resolution images from conventional diffraction-limited microscopy images when trained using a small dataset containing 15 field-of-views (FOVs). DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. Demonstrate using DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to estimate the super-resolution images when trained with a small training dataset (15 FOVs) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and the fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAE samples). Conventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate super-resolution images while models, including the DenseED blocks can. The average resolution and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements achieved using DenseED blocks in FCNs when trained with 15 FOVs are 2 times and ~3.2 dB, respectively. In addition, we evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (experimentally captured target and computationally generated target) that are used to train the FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed with DenseED blocks outperform compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks. Hence, the proposed approach indicates that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application specific/experimental modality specific imaging platforms such as MRI/X-ray and other in vivo imaging modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supramodal representation of the sense of body ownership in the human parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices</a></h4>

              
                The sense of body ownership, defined as the sensation that ones body belongs to oneself, is a fundamental component of bodily self-consciousness. Several studies have shown the importance of multisensory integration for the emergence of the sense of body ownership, together with the involvement of the parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices in bodily awareness. However, whether the sense of body ownership elicited by different sources of signal, especially visuotactile and visuomotor inputs, is represented by common neural patterns remains to be elucidated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the existence of neural correlates of the sense of body ownership independent of the sensory modalities. Participants received tactile stimulation or executed finger movements while given synchronous and asynchronous visual feedback of their hand. We used multi-voxel patterns analysis (MVPA) to decode the synchronous and asynchronous conditions with cross-classification between two modalities: the classifier was first trained in the visuotactile sessions and then tested in the visuomotor sessions and vice versa. Regions of interest-based and searchlight analyses revealed significant above-chance cross-classification accuracies in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and the left extrastriate body area (EBA). Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the cross-classification accuracy in the left PMv and the difference in subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Our findings revealed the neural representations of the sense of body ownership in the IPS, PMv, and EBA that is invariant to the sensory modalities.

Significance StatementPrevious studies have shown neural correlates of the sense of body ownership in parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices. However, whether the sense of body ownership induced by different sensory inputs is represented in common neural patterns remains unelucidated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we investigated neural representations of the sense of body ownership invariant to modalities. Decoding neural patterns for visuotactile and visuomotor modalities revealed successful cross-classification accuracies in intraparietal sulcus (IPS), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and extrastriate body area (EBA). Furthermore, cross-classification accuracy in PMv was positively correlated with subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership. These findings demonstrate that supramodal representations in parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices underlie the sense of body ownership.
