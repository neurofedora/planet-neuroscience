              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09351">The Third Visual Pathway for Social Perception</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influential models of primate visual cortex describe two functionally distinct pathways: a ventral pathway for object recognition and the dorsal pathway for spatial and action processing. However, recent human and non-human primate research suggests the existence of a third visual pathway projecting from early visual cortex through the motion-selective area V5/MT into the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here we integrate anatomical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence demonstrating that this pathway specializes in processing dynamic social cues such as facial expressions, eye gaze, and body movements. This third pathway supports social perception by computing the actions and intentions of other people. These findings enhance our understanding of visual cortical organization and highlight the STS's critical role in social cognition, suggesting that visual processing encompasses a dedicated neural circuit for interpreting socially relevant motion and behavior.

                arXiv:2512.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09524">NeuroSketch: An Effective Framework for Neural Decoding via Systematic Architectural Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding. Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/NeuroSketch.

                arXiv:2512.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive behavior across species via reward prediction errors (RPEs), but the neural origins of species-specific adaptability remain unknown. Integrating RL modeling, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging during reversal learning, we discovered convergent RPE signatures - shared monoaminergic/synaptic gene upregulation and neuroanatomical representations, yet humans outperformed macaques behaviorally. Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity.

                arXiv:2511.02766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes

                arXiv:2512.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241">Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.02241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08951">AI Co-Artist: A LLM-Powered Framework for Interactive GLSL Shader Animation Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative coding and real-time shader programming are at the forefront of interactive digital art, enabling artists, designers, and enthusiasts to produce mesmerizing, complex visual effects that respond to real-time stimuli such as sound or user interaction. However, despite the rich potential of tools like GLSL, the steep learning curve and requirement for programming fluency pose substantial barriers for newcomers and even experienced artists who may not have a technical background. In this paper, we present AI Co-Artist, a novel interactive system that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to support the iterative evolution and refinement of GLSL shaders through a user-friendly, visually-driven interface. Drawing inspiration from the user-guided evolutionary principles pioneered by the Picbreeder platform, our system empowers users to evolve shader art using intuitive interactions, without needing to write or understand code. AI Co-Artist serves as both a creative companion and a technical assistant, allowing users to explore a vast generative design space of real-time visual art. Through comprehensive evaluations, including structured user studies and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate that AI Co-Artist significantly reduces the technical threshold for shader creation, enhances creative outcomes, and supports a wide range of users in producing professional-quality visual effects. Furthermore, we argue that this paradigm is broadly generalizable. By leveraging the dual strengths of LLMs-semantic understanding and program synthesis, our method can be applied to diverse creative domains, including website layout generation, architectural visualizations, product prototyping, and infographics.

                arXiv:2512.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical neural networks are known for their ability to approximate mappings between finite-dimensional spaces, but they fall short in capturing complex operator dynamics across infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.

Abstract: We extend recent 256 SSE vector work to 512 AVX giving a four fold speedup. We use MAGPIE (Machine Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) to speedup a C++ linear genetic programming interpreter. Local search is provided with three alternative hand optimised codes, revision history and the Intel 512 bit AVX512VL documentation as C++ XML. Magpie is applied to the new Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel interpreter for Peter Nordin's linear genetic programming GPengine.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09209">Beyond Algorithm Evolution: An LLM-Driven Framework for the Co-Evolution of Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithms and Prompts</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of automated algorithm design has been advanced by frameworks such as EoH, FunSearch, and Reevo. Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution.

                arXiv:2512.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel predict-then-optimize framework for maritime search operations that integrates trajectory forecasting with UAV deployment optimization-an end-to-end approach not addressed in prior work. A large language model predicts the drifter's trajectory, and spatial uncertainty is modeled using Gaussian-based particle sampling. Unlike traditional static deployment methods, we dynamically adapt UAV detection radii based on distance and optimize their placement using meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments on real-world data from the Korean coastline demonstrate that our method, particularly the repair mechanism designed for this problem, significantly outperforms the random search baselines. This work introduces a practical and robust integration of trajectory prediction and spatial optimization for intelligent maritime rescue.

                arXiv:2512.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm.

                arXiv:2512.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.

                arXiv:2512.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.

                arXiv:2505.17863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.

                arXiv:2510.25781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), whose design is merely inspired, rather than dictated, by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape. By collecting and categorizing a large set of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting modern KAN development. We organize the review around four core themes:
  (i) presenting a precise history of Kolmogorov's superposition theory toward neural-network formulations; (ii) establishing the formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs; (iii) analyzing the critical role of basis functions; and (iv) organizing recent advancements in accuracy, efficiency, regularization, and convergence.
  Finally, we provide a practical Choose-Your-KAN guide to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate architectures, and we close by identifying current research gaps and future directions. The associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review) complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 11 December 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67440-x">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67440-x</a></p>Catalytic enantioselective hydroarylation of alkynes is a concise protocol towards axial, helical, and planar chirality, but most reactions involve noble-metal catalysts. Here, the authors report a copper-catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective hydroarylation of 1-alkynylindoles with (hetero)arenes, affording C─N axially chiral carbazolyl and phenanthryl indoles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v5?src=rss">Association between perceived oral health and oral health–related quality of life among hospital staff [version 5; peer review: 5 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Oral health is closely linked to well-being at work; however, evidence in hospital personnel remains limited. Methods Cross-sectional study in a Level II-1 hospital (n = 72). Oral-health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) was measured with OHIP-14 and perceived oral health (POH) with a modified HU-DBI. Bivariate associations were estimated with Spearman’s ρ and 95% confidence intervals; domain-level relationships were examined with proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2). Results OHRQoL was distributed as 38.9% Excellent, 26.4% Fair and 34.7% Poor; POH concentrated in the Low level (52.8%), followed by Excellent (29.2%) and Fair (18.1%). POH correlated positively with OHRQoL (ρ = 0.391; 95% CI 0.18–0.57; p = 0.001). Domain-level analyses showed the strongest links for psychological discomfort (ρ = 0.421; p < 0.001; pseudo-R2 = 0.111; p = 0.027) and physical disability (ρ = 0.319; p = 0.006; pseudo-R2 = 0.167; p = 0.004); social disability (ρ = 0.242; p = 0.040; pseudo-R2 = 0.124; p = 0.017) and handicap (ρ = 0.298; p = 0.011; pseudo-R2 = 0.131; p = 0.013) were smaller but significant, whereas functional limitation was non-significant (ρ = 0.096; p = 0.424; pseudo-R2 = 0.014; p = 0.6). Conclusions Better perceived oral health is significantly associated with higher oral-health-related quality of life among hospital staff. Consequently, targeted workplace strategies, including education for self-care, pain management, and functional support, could enhance oral well-being. Moreover, open instruments and pilot reliability outputs are available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

                <p>Loss of function variants of <I>SCN1B</I> are associated with a range of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), including Dravet syndrome. These DEEs feature a wide range of severe neurological disabilities, including changes to social, motor, mood, sleep, and cognitive function which are notoriously difficult to treat, and high rates of early mortality. While the symptomology of <I>SCN1B</I>-associated DEEs indicates broad changes in neural function, most research has focused on epilepsy-related brain structures and function. Mechanistic studies of <I>SCN1B</I>/<I>Scn1b</I> have delineated diverse roles in development and adult maintenance of neural function, via cell adhesion, ion channel regulation, and other intra- and extra-cellular actions. However, use of mouse models is limited as knock-out of <I>Scn1b</I>, globally and even in some cell-specific models (e.g., parvalbumin+ interneuron-specific knock-out) in adult mice, leads to severe and progressive epilepsy, health deterioration, and 100% mortality within weeks. Here, we report findings using male and female mice of a novel transgenic line in which <I>Scn1b</I> was specifically deleted in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Unlike most existing models, these mice survive and thrive. However, we quantified marked decrements to Purkinje cell physiology as well as motor, social, and cognitive dysfunction. Our data indicates that cerebellar Purkinje cells are an important node for dysfunction and neural disabilities in <I>SCN1B</I>-related DEEs and combined with previous work identify this as a potentially vital site for understanding mechanisms of DEEs and developing therapies that can treat these disorders holistically.</p>

                <p>Heterogeneity of presynaptic input and postsynaptic intrinsic excitability are two major variables that regulate neuronal firing rates and patterns. Yet, little is known about how these variables interplay to diversify the fidelity of excitation-spike coupling. To investigate their reciprocal relationship, we took advantage of the one-to-one innervation of mature calyx of Held&ndash;principal neuron synapses at the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the auditory brainstem of male and female mice. Given that sustainability of synaptic drive is directly correlated with the morphological complexity of presynaptic calyces, we characterized the intrinsic excitability of postsynaptic neurons with morphologically identified inputs. We discovered that morphologically simple calyces (stalks and &le;10 swellings) providing weaker synaptic drive preferentially innervate principal neurons that exhibit lower stimulation-spike coupling fidelity and display phasic firing patterns, while neurons contacted by complex calyces (stalks and &gt;20 swellings) providing stronger synaptic drive exhibit higher stimulation-spike coupling fidelity and are predominantly associated with tonic firing. Phasic and tonic firing neurons have similar action potential shape and composition of low-threshold Kv1 and high-threshold Kv3 potassium currents but display marked differences in their input resistance and resting potassium conductance. Our results support a model in which a postsynaptic gradient of leak potassium channel density complements the presynaptic morpho-functional continuum to create an extended dynamic range of MNTB outputs. This synergy expands the coding capacity within a single population of neurons and supports multiple streams of auditory processing.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<I><sup></sup></I> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>

                <p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal maps and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) value and goal representations support foraging in continuous spaces. How might hippocampal&ndash;vPFC interactions control the balance between behavioral exploration and exploitation? Using fMRI and reinforcement learning modeling, we investigated vPFC and hippocampal responses as humans (38 female, 34 male) explored and exploited a continuous one-dimensional space, with out-of-session and out-of-sample replication (23 female, 20 male). The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC&ndash;hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration. Considered alongside electrophysiological studies, our findings suggest that exploration targets are identified through coordinated activity binding prefrontal default network value representations to posterior hippocampal maps.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/50/e0508252025?rss=1">Experience-Dependent Plasticity to Visual Sequences in Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reflects Familiarity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity ("sequence plasticity") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that "sequence plasticity" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/50/e0636252025?rss=1">Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>

                <p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>

                <p>The role of P2X4, one of the most abundant ionotropic purinergic receptors in the central nervous system, is explored in the context of auditory function. We observed, by using constitutive and conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in adult mouse models of either sex, a specific high expression of mCherry-tagged P2X4 in living cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), from immature postnatal stages to adulthood. This P2X4-mCherry expression, confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in wild-type (WT) mice, was mainly concentrated in the intracellular apical region of OHCs, in the area of Hensen's body, a lysosomal-rich region, specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye lysotracker. In addition, the basal cholinergic efferent synaptic region of the OHCs was found to express P2X4 at the cell membrane. Surprisingly, the assessment of the hearing function in constitutive P2X4 knock-out (P2X4KO) mice showed improved auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) with smaller latencies and lower thresholds. These P2X4KO mice, as well as conditional Myo15-Cre:P2X4KO mice, displayed enhanced distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), suggesting an improved electromechanical "amplification" activity by OHCs. These mutant animals showed reduced inhibition of DPOAEs by contralateral noise, consistent with a weaker inhibitory effect of the medial cholinergic olivocochlear (MOC) efferent circuit on OHCs. When P2X4KO mice were exposed to noise (white noise 95&nbsp;dB SPL, 12&nbsp;h), ABRs decreased and partially recovered much like WT mice, but DPOAEs showed faster recovery. We concluded that the MOC negative feedback modulation of cochlear micromechanics, in addition to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable &alpha;9/&alpha;10 nicotinic receptors, also requires the activation of postsynaptic P2X4 receptors in OHCs.</p>

                <p>GPR85/SREB2 is an exceptionally conserved orphan seven-transmembrane receptor with poorly understood biological function. Here, we combine genetic, imaging, transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches in zebrafish to uncover the properties and roles of Gpr85 across development and adulthood. We show that, as in mammals, <I>gpr85</I> is expressed in diverse neuronal populations within the central nervous system, retina, and intestine. Using a fluorochrome-tagged Gpr85 construct expressed in native domains, we provide the first in vivo evidence that Gpr85 is enriched at synaptic sites in both the brain and retina. Transcriptomic profiling of cerebellar granule cells (GCs) lacking Gpr85 reveals gene expression changes consistent with increased neuronal activity. Electrophysiological recordings from cerebellar slices confirm that Gpr85-deficient GCs exhibit heightened excitability. Functionally, Gpr85 loss enhances light-triggered motor responses in larval zebrafish. Together, these findings position Gpr85 as a synapse-enriched modulator of neuronal excitability and sensory-driven behavior, offering new insight into its roles.</p>

                <p>Humans are skilled at recognizing everyday objects from pictures, even if we have never encountered the depicted object in real life. However, if we have encountered an object, how does that real-world experience affect the representation of its photographic image in the human brain? We developed a paradigm that involved brief real-world manual exploration of everyday objects prior to the measurement of brain activity with fMRI while viewing pictures of those objects (40 participants, 28 females). We found that while object-responsive regions in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal cortex contained robust visual representations of specific objects, those representations were not modulated by brief real-world exploration. However, there was an effect of visual experience in object-responsive regions in the form of repetition suppression of the BOLD response over repeated presentations of the object images. Real-world experience with an object produced foci of increased activation in the medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex, regions that have previously been associated with the encoding and retrieval of remembered items in explicit memory paradigms. Our discovery that these regions are engaged during spontaneous recognition of real-world objects from their 2D image demonstrates that modulation of activity in medial regions by familiarity is neither stimulus nor task-specific. Overall, our results support separable coding in the human brain of the visual appearance of an object from the associations gained via real-world experience. The richness of object representations beyond their photographic image has important implications for understanding object recognition in the human brain and in computational models.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by high relapse rates, underscoring an urgent need to identify neurobiological mechanisms of opioid seeking. The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is a key brain region implicated in drug seeking in humans and rodents. While the role of its downstream targets is beginning to be clarified, the upstream inputs that regulate PVT activity during opioid seeking remain poorly understood. The prelimbic cortex (PL) provides substantial excitatory input to the PVT and has a well-established role in cue-guided behaviors and drug seeking. However, the contribution of the PL -&gt; PVT pathway to heroin seeking is yet to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we trained male and female rats to self-administer heroin for 12&nbsp;d and then used a pathway-specific chemogenetic approach to transiently inhibit PL -&gt; PVT projections during a cued heroin seeking test following 14&nbsp;d of abstinence. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway significantly reduced heroin seeking. We next examined synaptic plasticity at PL -&gt; PVT synapses ex vivo on withdrawal day 14 and found that abstinence from heroin self-administration induced an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio compared with saline controls. Importantly, the increase in synaptic strength was normalized by applying an ex vivo optogenetic long-term depression (LTD) protocol. Finally, we applied the same optogenetic LTD protocol in vivo immediately before the cued seeking test and found that depotentiation of PL -&gt; PVT synaptic activity significantly reduced heroin seeking. These findings identify PL -&gt; PVT inputs as key drivers of heroin seeking and demonstrate that weakening this pathway reduces opioid seeking.</p>

                <p>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the extended amygdala, integrates emotional and arousal-related signals. While GABAergic BNST (GABA<sup>BNST</sup>) neurons have been implicated in promoting transitions from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to wakefulness, their downstream mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit through which GABA<sup>BNST</sup> neurons promote arousal via projections to a midbrain region known as the deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe), located within the broader mesencephalic reticular formation. In male mice, we used a combination of optogenetics, fiber photometry, neural ablation, and tracing approaches to dissect this circuit. Optogenetic stimulation of GABA<sup>BNST</sup> terminals in the DpMe during NREM sleep elicited rapid transitions to wakefulness and increased activity of glutamatergic DpMe (GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup>) neurons, as assessed by <I>c-fos</I> mRNA expression and calcium imaging. Similarly, an aversive air-puff activated GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons, suggesting engagement by emotionally salient stimuli. Ablation of GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons markedly attenuated arousal responses triggered by GABA<sup>BNST</sup> stimulation, underscoring their essential role in this circuit. While monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed local input neurons to GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> cells, in situ hybridization identified few <I>Vgat-</I>positive interneurons among them. These findings suggest that GABA<sup>BNST</sup> neurons may influence GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons through noncanonical GABAergic mechanisms or via more complex local circuits beyond a simple disinhibition model. Together, these findings delineate a previously uncharacterized BNST&ndash;DpMe circuit that allows emotionally relevant stimuli to override sleep and promote arousal. This pathway may contribute to stress-related sleep disturbances and represents a potential target for therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders associated with emotional dysregulation.</p>

                <p>Impaired GABAergic inhibition, so-called neural disinhibition, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has been linked to cognitive deficits. The novel object recognition (NOR) task has been used widely to study cognitive deficits in rodents. However, the contribution of prefrontal cortical and hippocampal GABAergic inhibition to NOR task performance has not been established. Here, we investigated NOR task performance in male Lister hooded rats following regional neural disinhibition or functional inhibition, using intracerebral microinfusion of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist muscimol, respectively. Our infusion targets were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and ventral hippocampus (VH). Using a within-subject design, we compared NOR task performance (1&nbsp;min retention delay) following bilateral regional saline, picrotoxin, or muscimol infusions made before the acquisition phase. In mPFC, neither functional inhibition nor neural disinhibition affected object recognition memory. However, in both the DH and VH, neural disinhibition impaired NOR relative to saline control, mainly by reducing novel object exploration time. In addition, functional inhibition of the DH impaired NOR, whereas VH functional inhibition tended to reduce novel object exploration at the highest dose used (alongside substantial nonspecific behavioral effects). Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal, but not prefrontal, GABAergic inhibition contributes to NOR at a 1&nbsp;min retention delay. Moreover, such NOR performance likely requires balanced neural activity in the DH, with both too little and too much DH activity impairing NOR memory. Our findings support that the NOR task can be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models.</p>

                <p>The synaptic circuits established by thalamocortical axons from the ventral posteromedial (VPM) and posterior (Po) nuclei in the first somatosensory cortex have been mapped in high detail as they are a prime model in functional and modeling studies of the interactions between the thalamus and cerebral cortex. In addition, VPM and Po neurons innervate the second somatosensory area (S2), but the synaptic organization of their axons in this area remained essentially unknown. On adult male mice, we combined axon labeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to measure and compare functionally relevant structural parameters of synaptic boutons (SBs), e.g., bouton and mitochondrial volume, vesicle pool size, as well as postsynaptic density (PSD) distribution and size. We report that SBs established by caudal VPM and rostral Po synapses resemble each other in their pre- and postsynaptic ultrastructure, while caudal Po SBs are on average 50% smaller in size, number of synaptic vesicles, and total PSD area. We observed a high prevalence (&gt;20%) of small synaptic contacts located in axon intervaricose regions that selectively contact thin, headless dendritic spines (a morphology associated with functionally "silent" synapses). In addition, comparison of the S2 SBs with our previous quantitative data on VPM and Po S1 SBs reveals that the wiring of thalamocortical synapses in Areas S2 and S1 is similar, supporting the view that both areas can process in parallel specific somatosensory signal streams.</p>

                <p>Studies of cognitive flexibility suggest that switching between different tasks can entail a transient switch cost. Here, we asked whether analogous switch costs exist in the context of switching between different motor skills. We tested whether participants (23 males and 12 females) could switch between a newly learned skill associated with a novel visuomotor mapping and an existing skill associated with an intuitive mapping. Participants showed increased errors in trials immediately following a switch between mappings. These errors were attributable to persisting with the preswitch policy rather than imperfect implementation or retrieval of the postswitch policy. A subset of our participants further learned a second new skill. Switching between these two novel skills was initially very challenging but improved with further training. Our findings suggest that switching between newly learned motor skills can be challenging and that errors in the context of switching between skills are primarily attributable to perseveration with the wrong control policy.</p>

                <p>Nociceptive afferents and dorsal horn neurons undergo significant functional changes in pathological pain conditions. The structural remodeling of synapses of C afferents, which may contribute to the long-term maintenance of these changes, is not well understood. To investigate this issue, we used quantitative immuno-electron microscopy with serial sections to examine the structural changes of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunopositive (+) and isolectin-B4+ (IB4+) axon terminals (boutons) and their pre- and postsynaptic elements in the rat medullary dorsal horn (MDH, trigeminal caudal nucleus). The study was conducted at 4&nbsp;d (CFA 4-day) and 21&nbsp;d (CFA 21-day) following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into the vibrissa pad of the male Sprague Dawley rats, when thermal hyperalgesia was severe and had recovered, respectively. The ultrastructural parameters correlated with synaptic strength (bouton volume, mitochondrial volume, docked vesicle number, postsynaptic density area, dendritic spine number and size) in CGRP+ and IB4+ boutons and their postsynaptic dendrites increased significantly in the CFA 4-day group compared with control. The fraction of IB4+ boutons receiving axoaxonic synapses and the number of GAD65/67+ boutons involved in pre- and postsynaptic inhibition decreased significantly in the CFA 4-day group compared with control; these changes were restored to control levels in the CFA 21-day group. These structural changes in the C afferents and their pre- and postsynaptic elements in the MDH following inflammation may provide the morphological basis for the development and long-term maintenance of craniofacial inflammatory pain.</p>

                <p>Sleep and feeding&mdash;typically mutually exclusive behaviors that are vital for survival and health&mdash;are intricately linked. Across species, chronic sleep loss or deprivation is associated with increased caloric intake, while fasting typically induces sleep suppression. Despite evidence for a dynamic relationship between these behaviors, how sleep affects eating habits and how changes in feeding behavior and nutrition alter sleep are not completely understood. Distinct neuronal manipulations in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> can dissociate sleep loss from subsequent homeostatic rebound, offering an optimal platform to examine the precise interplay between these fundamental behaviors. Here, we investigated concomitant changes in sleep and food intake in individual flies, as well as respiratory metabolic expenditure that accompany behavioral and neuronal manipulations that induce sleep loss in males. We find that sleep disruptions resulting in energy deficit through increased metabolic expenditure and manifesting as increased food intake were consistently followed by rebound sleep. In contrast, sleep loss that does not induce rebound sleep was not accompanied by increased metabolism and food intake. Our results suggest that homeostatic sleep rebound is linked to energy deficit accrued during sleep loss. Collectively, these findings support the notion that sleep functions to conserve energy and highlight the need to examine the effects of metabolic therapeutics on sleep. Our findings also stress the importance of precise measurements of sleep and the value of considering multiple indicators of energy balance, including metabolism and food intake.</p>

                <p>A diapause program that anticipates harsh seasonal environments contributes to flexible seasonal adaptation of organisms. Many animals use the photoperiod as a cue for seasonal sensing, and a circadian clock system is suggested to be important for photoperiodic physiological regulation. Although brain regions that are important for photoperiodic responses have been reported, the detailed system linking the circadian clock to photoperiodic diapause switching remains unclear. Here, we show the circadian clock-based neural mechanism for diapause switching by the female insect <I>Riptortus pedestris</I>, which enters reproductive diapause. This study focused on the insect neuroendocrine center, pars lateralis (PL), and analyzed its role in the photoperiodic control of diapause. PL neurons mainly express two types of neuropeptides: corazonin or short neuropeptide F (sNPF). RNA interference (RNAi) has demonstrated the importance of these neuropeptides in controlling diapause. Corazonin is essential for diapause induction under short photoperiod, and sNPF contributes to the appropriate determination of diapause according to the photoperiod. Additionally, electrophysiological analyses revealed that PL peptidergic neurons photoperiodically changed their neural activity, switching from active to silent mode by diapause-averting long photoperiod. We demonstrated that positive and negative regulators of the circadian clock are reciprocally involved in switching of PL activity and diapause. RNAi of a positive regulator <I>cycle</I> activates PL activity and induces reproductive diapause under long photoperiod, whereas that of a negative regulator <I>period</I> silences PL activity and averts diapause under short photoperiod. Our findings highlight that PL peptidergic neurons mediate the circadian clock system and the photoperiodic control of diapause.</p>

                <p>Across brain regions and species, the dynamics and balance of excitation and inhibition critically determine neuronal firing. The hippocampal dentate gyrus is a brain area thought to be strongly regulated by inhibition. In vivo, it exhibits remarkably sparse activity, a characteristic proposed to underlie computational tasks like pattern separation. Several populations of interneurons mediate strong feedforward as well as feedback inhibition onto granule cells. However, how the dynamics of inhibition controls granule cell activity in vivo is insufficiently studied. Using two-photon in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in mice of either sex, we show that sensory stimulation activates only a small number of dentate gyrus granule cells, while inducing widespread inhibition across the remaining granule cell population. Dual-color imaging of both bulk medial perforant path activity and individual granule cell activity allowed us to probe input&ndash;output conversion in this pathway. To examine the interplay of MPP-evoked excitation and inhibition at the cellular level, we used in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, while simultaneously photo-activating MPP inputs. Our findings reveal that MPP-triggered inhibition is fast, significantly larger than excitation, and long-lasting. These results reveal specific properties of inhibition in the dentate gyrus inhibition that are likely crucial for its computational functions, in maintaining sparse activity with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

                Purpose Game-based learning enhances eye health education and skill acquisition but poses distinct challenges in developing effective educational games. The present study aims to demonstrate the developmental challenges encountered at various stages of creating e-learning game prototypes for training eye health professionals. Methods Structured focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted involving all the stakeholders involved in game development, the subject experts, and the technical experts. The four phases of FGDs were as follows: i) Ideation and team development; ii) Identifying the competencies and mapping these with cognition; iii) Concept to prototype development; a) Defining questions and data points; b) Accumulating content; and iv) Prototype testing and feedback. The FGDs were audio recorded, the descriptive data were transcribed verbatim, and the data were thematically analysed. Results The challenges differed in every phase of the game development. Data on the strengths and weaknesses of the game development were collected via participant recall. Throughout the project, the technical team had to understand the requirements of the subject experts and vice versa. Participants’ understanding of e-learning games varied across the teams. Choosing appropriate topics for game development, identifying and mapping underlying cognition to exit competency, generating data, translating concepts into games, determining the role of communication in maintaining team dynamics, and seeking early feedback from end-users were some of the challenges encountered. Conclusion The lessons learned from overcoming procedural challenges in this study may be applied by others who are developing game-based educational tools for eye health education.

                Background Malaria is a life-threatening vector-borne disease caused by five species of the genus Plasmodium (P.) It can present as mixed infections that remain underreported and pose diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic challenges. The objective of the present study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and biological features of four cases of mixed Plasmodium infection. Methods This retrospective descriptive study included cases of mixed Plasmodium infections diagnosed at the Parasitology Laboratory of the Military Hospital of Tunis between 2022 and 2025. Diagnosis was established using May–Grünwald–Giemsa–stained thin blood smears, Giemsa–stained thick smears, and rapid diagnostic tests. Plasmodium species were identified according to standard microscopic morphological criteria. Results We report four cases of mixed Plasmodium infection diagnosed in military personnel returning from deployment in Central Africa. The patients were aged 31–52 years (mean age 38.8 years) with sex ratio 3. They presented within 10–30 days post-return with fever (38–42 °C) associated with headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and/or vomiting. All had adhered to malaria chemoprophylaxis, and three reported no prior malaria episodes, while one patient had a history of six previous attacks. Rapid diagnostic tests were positive for pan-Plasmodium pLDH in all cases; two patients were also positive for HRP2. Peripheral blood smears confirmed mixed infections. Parasitemia was generally low (<1% in three cases, 1% in one case). Treatment consisted of artemether–lumefantrine (Coartem®) for all patients, combined with primaquine for those with P. ovale infection. Clinical evolution was favorable in all cases, and follow-up blood smears on days 3, 7, and 28 confirmed parasitological clearance, with only rare degenerated trophozoites observed in one patient on day 3. Conclusion Mixed Plasmodium infections can influence disease severity, treatment outcomes, and drug resistance. Accurate diagnosis and radical therapy are keys to preventing relapses.

                <p>by Davide Luciano, F. Emil Thomasen, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Gaston Courtade</p>

The activity of GT-B glycosyltransferases depends on their conformational flexibility and high substrate specificity, but the molecular basis of these features is still not well defined. The GT70 family contains a single well-characterized enzyme, GumK, a glucuronosyltransferase from <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> required for xanthan gum biosynthesis. Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, whereas donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for UDP-glucuronate is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation. Comparative analysis highlights GumK-specific motifs that distinguish it from homologous GTs. This work provides mechanistic insight into the GT70 family and the dynamic behavior of GT-B enzymes, establishing principles for the rational engineering of GumK to modify the monosaccharide composition of xanthan gum.

Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models—entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models—have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavioral, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.

                <p>by Ian K. Gingerich, Brittany A. Goods, H. Robert Frost</p>

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides critical insights into the spatial organization of gene expression, enabling researchers to unravel the intricate relationship between cellular environments and biological function. Identifying spatial domains within tissues is key to understanding tissue architecture and mechanisms underlying development and disease progression. Here, we present Randomized Spatial PCA (RASP), a novel spatially-aware dimensionality reduction method for ST data. RASP is designed to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing techniques, scale to datasets with 100,000+ locations, support flexible integration of non-transcriptomic covariates, and reconstruct de-noised, spatially-smoothed gene expression values. RASP itself is not a clustering or domain detection method; cell types and spatial regions are obtained by clustering the RASP PCs, and the effective cluster resolution depends on the K-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph and a smoothing parameter <i>β</i>. It employs a randomized two-stage PCA framework and configurable spatial smoothing. RASP was compared to BASS, GraphST, SEDR, SpatialPCA, STAGATE, and CellCharter using diverse ST datasets (10x Visium, Stereo-Seq, MERFISH, 10x Xenium) on human and mouse tissues. In these benchmarks, RASP delivers comparable or superior accuracy in tissue-domain detection while achieving substantial improvements in computational speed. Its efficiency not only reduces runtime and resource requirements but also makes it practical to explore a broad range of spatial-smoothing parameters in a high-throughput fashion. By enabling rapid re-analysis under different parameter settings, RASP empowers users to fine-tune the balance between resolution and noise suppression on large, high-resolution subcellular datasets—a critical capability when investigating complex tissue architecture.

                <p>by Adhithi Lakshmikanthan, Minnie Kay, Pim J.A. Oomen</p>

Biological sex plays a crucial role in the outcomes of cardiac health and therapies. Sex hormones are known to strongly influence cardiac remodeling through intracellular signaling pathways, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this need, we developed and validated a logic-based systems biology model of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy that, for the first time, incorporates the effects of both estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) alongside well-established hypertrophic stimuli (Strain, angiotensin II (AngII), and endothelin-1 (ET-1)). We qualitatively validated the model to literature data with 82% agreement. Quantitative validation was done by simulating the impact of the inputs (E2, T, Strain, AngII, and ET-1) on cardiac hypertrophy, captured as change in CellArea. We perturbed the validated model to examine the differential response to hypertrophy and identify changes in influential and sensitive downstream nodes for a pre-menopausal female, post-menopausal female, younger male, and older male condition. Our model shows how T and E2 interact with each other and other hypertrophic stimuli, with T demonstrating a more potent hypertrophic effect than E2. This model increases our understanding of the mechanisms through which sex hormones influence cardiac hypertrophy and can aid with developing more effective cardiac therapies for all patients.

The mammalian brain exhibits notable interspecies variation. Microanatomical and molecular differences in homologous neurons, those with similar locations and developmental origins across species, are best characterized in the neocortical mantle, the center of complex brain functions; however, the purpose of these differences remains unclear. We performed whole-cell microelectrode recordings along with microanatomical and molecular analyses of human fast-spiking parvalbumin (pvalb)-expressing interneurons in neocortical tissue resected during brain surgery, comparing them with similar data obtained from the mouse neocortex. The action potential (AP) firing threshold was lower in human neurons than in mouse neurons. This was due to a deficiency in low-voltage–activated inhibitory Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 potassium channels in the axon initial segment (AIS), a specialized axonal region that determines AP threshold and initiation, in human cells. In contrast, Kv1 ion channels were prominent in mouse neurons. The AIS was also moderately elongated in humans. Computational simulations of fast-spiking interneurons revealed that the human-type AIS lowers the AP threshold and shortens the time lag for AP initiation. We found that the low membrane AP firing threshold in pvalb neurons is closely linked to slow membrane potential kinetics in the soma. Thus, the human AIS supports fast in–fast out circuit function in human pvalb neurons, compensating for electrically slow somatic membrane responses. When formulating therapeutic strategies that involve fast-spiking neurons, it is crucial to take into account the molecular and functional species differences.

                This study applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to analyse job applicant data at a construction consulting firm. Considering three main variables—AutoCAD drawing skills, planning and supervision report writing skills, and adaptability—this study aims to categorize job applicants into three groups: “Rejected,” “Under Consideration,” and “Accepted.” The clustering process was conducted using the R program with an initial centroid-based approach and visualized through 2D and 3D scatter plots to map the distribution patterns of applicants based on their attributes. The results of the study show that this clustering not only provides a deep understanding of the characteristics of applicants but also supports the company in optimizing data-driven recruitment strategies. Applicants with high scores in all three variables tend to fall into the “Accepted” category, while those with moderate scores are categorized as “Under Consideration.” The visualization of results offers sharper insights into applicant distribution, which can be used to identify training needs or improvements to the selection process. This research contributes to the development of an efficient and objective data-driven recruitment system in the construction sector.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1387/v1?src=rss">Gamification and the development of metacognitive processes: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Gamification has encouraged growing interest in educational research because of its potential to improve motivation, participation, and self-regulated learning. However, its contribution to the development of metacognitive processes has not been studied thoroughly. This systematic literature review examines how gamification-based strategies support metacognitive processes, such as planning, monitoring, and evaluation, in educational contexts (García-López et al., 2023; Gkintoni et al., 2024). Methods This review was conducted using the PRISMA 2020 methodology. Searches were conducted in Scopus and the Web of Science using the terms gamification, education, and metacognition. Only peer-reviewed, open-access articles published between 2019 and 2024 were included. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied during the selection of titles and abstracts and during the full-text review. After removing duplicates (n = 115), 253 records were examined; 181 were excluded because of irrelevance and 71 were included in the final analysis. Thematic analysis was used to extract information on theoretical frameworks, methodologies, metacognitive components, and higher-order cognitive processes. Results The findings revealed that gamification positively contributes to metacognition by activating processes, such as self-regulation, monitoring, and decision-making. The central elements of gamification, such as immediate feedback, progressive challenges, autonomy, and reward systems, support metacognitive awareness, and encourage active participation. Frequently cited theoretical frameworks, including studies, show that gamification promotes higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Conclusions Gamification strengthens metacognitive processes when instructional design integrates meaningful goals, feedback mechanisms, cognitive challenges, and reflection opportunities. Evidence suggests that educational environments based on gamification are effective in promoting the planning, monitoring, and evaluation skills essential for autonomous learning and metacognitive development (Ask et al., 2023). Future research should expand the scope of these databases and include non-open-access studies to reduce potential biases.

                Rouyer et al. reveal that cancer cells leave behind collagen-bound membrane debris during migration along collagen fibrils, which can transfer invasive traits to nearby non-invasive cells. These structures, named collagen tracks, represent a previously unknown way of communication between tumor cells, highlighting a potential target to limit cancer progression.

                Leydig cells are central to the development and homeostasis of male reproductive functions. Yu et al. identify a postnatal Gli1+ progenitor population that gives rise to Leydig cells during puberty and also contributes to their turnover and response to injury, providing a framework for understanding postnatal Leydig cell dynamics.

                Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) arises when DRG M-TRMφs oxidize and release disulfide HMGB1. This alarmin activates neuronal TLR4 to upregulate TRPV1 and drive allodynia. Inhibiting PDIA3 or GSDMD or neutralizing ds-HMGB1 reduces pain without impairing chemotherapy. Patient serum ds-HMGB1 correlates with neuropathic pain severity in OIPN, suggesting a biomarker and target.

                Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder associated with neurological symptoms that have been attributed to mTOR signaling. In this work, Afshar-Saber et al. demonstrate that altered mTOR activity disrupts neuronal differentiation and changes in DNA methylation. This results in rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, being ineffective in rescuing neuronal hyperactivity after maturation.

                Population growth of pathogen-spreading mosquitoes relies on efficient egg laying. Dong et al. report the behavioral reprogramming that occurs after a blood meal: daytime-biting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes becomes hyperactive and show nocturnal humidity-seeking and egg-laying activity. The clock gene cycle is required for the proper timing and efficiency of egg laying.

                da Silva Castanheiro et al. examine the development of individualized brain activity across a person’s life. Rhythmic brain activity distinguishes individuals across age groups, with activity in sensory and motor regions becoming increasingly distinctive in early adulthood. These developmental changes in individualized brain activity align with specific patterns of cortical gene expression.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 10 December 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03829-4">doi:10.1038/d41586-025-03829-4</a></p>The tension of conventional surgical sutures can affect wound healing and is dependent on the surgeon’s experience. Imaging and simulations reveal that slipknots can reproducibly store and release force, enabling precise and consistent surgical knotting without the need for electronic sensors or specialized equipment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106545">Addressing cultural and knowledge barriers to enable preclinical sex inclusive research</a></h4>

              
                For over 30 years, research has highlighted a sex bias in early research, risking the validity of biological knowledge. The first step towards change is effectively challenging misconceptions, allowing researchers to perceive sex inclusive research as doable. Utilising the theory of planned behaviour, we quantified researchers’ intention as a proxy measure for conducting sex inclusive research and explored attitude (value of the behaviour), subjective norm (perceived social pressure), and behavioural control (ability to conduct the behaviour). Additionally, we quantified the knowledge gap, prevalence of misconceptions, and assessed perceived benefits and barriers. We tested a workshop intervention that directly challenges the cultural embedded barriers. The data shows researchers’ intentions were high, but they had weak statistical knowledge and misunderstandings leading to a perception that inclusive research is prohibitive due to cost and animal use. We demonstrate that participation in the training intervention improved knowledge, altered the perceived barriers, and cultural expectations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98063">Dock-and-lock binding of SxIP ligands is required for stable and selective EB1 interactions</a></h4>

              
                End binding protein 1 (EB1) is a key component of the signalling networks at microtubule plus ends. It contains an N-terminal microtubule-binding CH domain and a C-terminal EBH domain interacting with SxIP-containing sequences of other microtubule plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs). Using a series of SxIP-containing peptides derived from the microtubule-actin cross-linking factor (MACF), we demonstrate that the SxIP motif itself binds to EBH with low affinity, and that the full interaction requires contribution of residues following the SxIP motif. Based on the solution structure and dynamics of the EBH/MACF complex, we propose a two-step ‘dock-and-lock’ model for the EBH interaction with targets, where the SxIP motif initially binds to a partially formed EBH pocket. This subsequently induces folding of the unstructured C-terminus and transition to a stable complex. We dissect contributions into the binding and design MACF mutations of the post-SxIP region that enhance the affinity by two orders of magnitude, leading to a nanomolar interaction. We verify the enhanced recruitment of the mutated peptide to the dynamic plus ends of MTs in a live-cell experiment. Our model explains EB1’s interaction with the SxIP-containing ligands and can be used to design small-molecule inhibitors blocking SxIP interaction with EB1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104431">Evidence of centromeric histone 3 chaperone involved in DNA damage repair pathway in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The centromeric protein-A (CENP-A) is an evolutionarily conserved histone H3 variant that marks the identity of the centromeres. Several mechanisms regulate the centromeric deposition of CENP-A as its mislocalization causes erroneous chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy-based diseases, including cancers. The most crucial deposition factor is a CENP-A specific chaperone, HJURP (Scm3 in budding yeast), which specifically binds to CENP-A. However, the discovery of HJURP as a DDR (DNA damage repair) protein and evidence of its binding to Holliday junctions in vitro indicate a CENP-A-deposition-independent role of these chaperones. In this study, using budding yeast, we demonstrate that Scm3 is crucial for the DDR pathway as Scm3-depleted cells are sensitive to DNA damage. We further observe that Scm3 depletion genetically interacts with the <i>rad52</i> DDR mutant and is compromised in activating DDR-mediated arrest. We demonstrate that Scm3 associates with DNA damage sites and undergoes posttranslational modifications upon DNA damage. Overall, from this report and earlier studies on HJURP, we conclude that DDR functions of CENP-A chaperones are conserved across eukaryotes. The revelation that these chaperones promote genome stability in more than one pathway has clinical significance.

                Understanding cortical circuit development requires tracking neuronal activity across days in the growing brain. While in vivo calcium imaging now enables such longitudinal studies, automated tools for reliably tracking large populations of neurons across sessions remain limited. Here, we present a novel cell tracking method based on sequential image registration, validated on calcium imaging data from the barrel cortex of mouse pups over 1 postnatal week. Our approach enables robust long-term analysis of several hundreds of individual neurons, allowing quantification of neuronal dynamics and representational stability over time. Using this method, we identified a key developmental transition in neuronal activity statistics, marking the emergence of arousal state modulation. Beyond this key finding, our method provides an essential tool for tracking developmental trajectories of individual neurons, which could help identify potential deviations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97751">The impact of different antimicrobial exposures on the gut microbiome in the ARMORD observational study</a></h4>

              
                Better metrics to compare the impact of different antimicrobials on the gut microbiome would aid efforts to control antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The Antibiotic Resistance in the Microbiome – Oxford (ARMORD) study recruited inpatients, outpatients, and healthy volunteers in Oxfordshire, UK, who provided stool samples for metagenomic sequencing. Data on previous antimicrobial use and potential confounders were recorded. Exposures to each antimicrobial were considered as factors in a multivariable linear regression, also adjusted for demographics, with separate analyses for those contributing samples cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Outcomes were Shannon diversity and relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa (<i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, and major anaerobic groups) and antimicrobial resistance genes (targeting beta-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and glycopeptides). 225 adults were included in the cross-sectional analysis, and a subset of 79 patients undergoing haematopoietic cell transplant provided serial samples for longitudinal analysis. Results were largely consistent between the two sampling frames. Recent use of piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, intravenous co-amoxiclav, and clindamycin was associated with large reductions in microbiome diversity and reduced abundance of anaerobes. Exposure to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem was associated with a decreased abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and an increased abundance of <i>Enterococcus</i> and major AMR genes, but there was no evidence that these antibiotics had a greater impact on microbiome diversity than iv co-amoxiclav or oral clindamycin. In contrast, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, antifungals, and antivirals had less impact on microbiome diversity and selection of AMR genes. Simultaneous estimation of the impact of over 20 antimicrobials on the gut microbiome and AMR gene abundance highlighted important differences between individual drugs. Some drugs in the WHO Access group (co-amoxiclav, clindamycin) had similar magnitude impact on microbiome diversity to those in the Watch group (meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam) with potential implications for acquisition of resistant organisms. Metagenomic sequencing can be used to compare the impact of different antimicrobial agents and treatment strategies on the commensal flora.

">KCNK18 c.1107del frameshift in peripheral neuropathy links TRESK dysfunction to neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain is commonly accompanied by hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, which is driven by regulation of several ion channels, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) that stabilize the resting membrane potential. The TWIK-Related Spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, K2p18.1) is predominantly expressed in sensory ganglia, where it provides major background K+ conductance. We describe a heterozygous c.1107del frameshift mutation in KCNK18, encoding TRESK, found in a patient with painful small fiber neuropathy and dysautonomia. This C-terminal c.1107del mutant is predicted to generate an elongated C-terminal domain, with an altered protein sequence. Whole-cell patch calmp recordings showed that the c.1107del variant reduced K+ current density, while heterozygous-like expression resulted in intermediate currents, consistent with a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Confocal imaging revealed decreased plasma membrane expression, indicating a trafficking-dependent loss of function while oligomerization with TRESK (homomeric channels) or TREK1 remained intact. In silico analysis revealed an altered phosphorylation pattern and reduced C-terminal hydrophobicity in the mutant TRESK. Overall, these findings support c.1107del as a pathogenic KCNK18 variant causing TRESK haploinsufficiency, offering mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.

">Taking it slow: A positive feedback chloride current in cone photoreceptors supports slow motion detection</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptors gate and shape visual information. Since perception ultimately guides action, the way photoreceptors transform light into neural signals constrains an animal's behavioural repertoire. Yet, the physiological role of the highly conserved calcium-dependent chloride current in cone photoreceptors has remained elusive. Whereas calcium-activated currents typically provide negative feedback, we identify a counter-intuitive positive feedback mechanism that enhances detection of slow motion. Using genetics, electrophysiology, and behavioural assays in zebrafish, we show that loss of this current exaggerates the biphasic character of cone impulse responses and diminishes their voltage response amplitude to low temporal frequencies (<1 Hz). These changes in photoreceptor properties translate to behaviour, reducing the gain of the optokinetic response to slow-moving stimuli. Mechanistically, the calcium-dependent chloride current acts as a positive feedback loop that sustains the photovoltage response and counteracts strong adaptation within the cone phototransduction cascade.

">Disruption of Striatal Intrinsic Ignition in Huntington's Disease: an In-Silico Perturbational Approach to Emulate Disease Progression and Recovery</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single gene that severely affects motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is ultimately fatal. While disruptions in the structural integrity of the striatum are well documented, less is known about how the underlying functional impairments relate to the disease. We developed a large-scale modeling framework based on intrinsic ignition to uncover functional anomalies during HD progression. We first measured how much a spontaneous event in one brain region influences the rest of the brain, then systematically perturbed the activity of the striatum to predict the empirical changes in functional connectivity (FC) by re-optimizing the model parameters and conducting in-silico experiments. Results showed that disruption of the activity dynamics in the caudate, and to some extent the putamen, are the key factors that explain a substantial amount of the variance in FC alterations during HD progression. We then assessed the ability to recover whole-brain functional activity by driving the caudate and putamen activity towards a healthy-like regime and found that, by tuning the local bifurcation parameter of caudate and putamen, it is possible to recover whole-brain healthy functional activity, albeit moderately. Surprisingly, although the functional disruptions in the caudate better explained the alterations in FC, the recovery of the dynamics was more effective in the putamen. Overall, our results suggest that the disruptions of the dynamics in the striatum can explain the gross functional connectivity changes in HD. Our study demonstrates that computational modeling is an important tool to reveal the underlying patterns behind the observed data and provides an opportunity to test interventional mechanisms in silico.

">Gene Therapy for Efficient Suppression of T-Type Channels in Treating Diabetic Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a chronic and often incurable syndrome, is one of the most common and unpleasant complications of diabetes. Effective clinical interventions for PDN are very limited and already developed approaches are characterized by lack of molecular or cellular target specificity and a short duration of therapeutic effects. Numerous investigations causally link upregulation of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels in peripheral nociceptive neurons to painful symptoms of PDN. Here we suggest an approach to alleviate these symptoms based on implementation of virus-mediated cell-specific delivery of vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Processed by Dicer into specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), they would suppress the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels. In order to experimentally validate this approach, we have initially confirmed the ability of designed Dicer-substrate small interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs) to suppress expression of T-type channels in neurons of primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Target sequences of the effectively interfering DsiRNA were then used to design shRNAs and the coding sequences of shRNAs were cloned into the vector pAAV under U6 promotor. This plasmid was also proved to be effective in interference with expression of the T-type channels in the rat cultured DRG neurons. The expression cassette of this plasmid will be packed into AAV6 particles with tropism to unmyelinated fibers to suppress T-type channel expression in nociceptive DRG neurons and to alleviate painful symptoms of PDN.

">Attentional focus and emotion modulate voice recognition deficits in cerebellar stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum, long regarded as a motor structure, is increasingly recognized for its role in higher-order cognitive and socio-emotional functions. Its contribution to vocal emotion decoding, however, remains insufficiently understood. While prior work has linked the cerebellum to attentional control and predictive coding, direct evidence for its role in modulating prosody recognition under explicit versus implicit attentional demands is lacking. This study investigated how cerebellar stroke, controlled for time since stroke in months, and with an equal number of left- and right-lateralized lesions, alters vocal emotion processing depending on attentional focus. We aimed to disentangle sensory encoding and integration from decisional contributions of the cerebellum by combining behavioral analyses, drift diffusion modeling (DDM), and functional MRI in cerebellar stroke. Fifteen patients with chronic, isolated cerebellar stroke and fifteen matched controls performed two tasks on vocal stimuli expressing anger, happiness, or neutrality. In the explicit task, participants categorized the expressed emotion; in the implicit task, they categorized speaker gender while ignoring emotional tone. Behavioral performance was analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression and DDM (angle model). Functional MRI analyses included conventional contrasts as well as model-based regressors derived from behavioral and computational parameters. Patients showed lower accuracy than controls, with deficits particularly pronounced in the explicit task. Performance also varied by emotion: gender recognition for angry voices (implicit processing) was relatively preserved, whereas happy and neutral voices were more vulnerable. Contrary to predictions, DDM parameters did not differ between groups. Instead, task effects dominated: implicit processing yielded higher drift rates, larger boundary separation, faster non-decision times, and stronger attentional focus compared to explicit recognition, suggesting that explicit evaluation imposes additional cognitive costs. At the neural level, patients recruited extended networks during explicit processing, including orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior insula, and cerebellar lobule IX, alongside cerebello-cortical tracts. Implicit processing was associated with more restricted activations, particularly in frontal opercular and cerebellar regions (lobule IX). Model-based analyses further revealed that successful categorization in patients relied on the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and pre-supplementary motor area, although these effects were not significant when controlling for time since stroke. Our findings demonstrate that the cerebellum does not primarily shape decision dynamics but optimizes sensory representations of prosodic cues for downstream evaluation. When predictive tuning is compromised, patients maintain intact decision processes yet rely on compensatory cortical recruitment, particularly during explicit tasks. This pattern supports predictive coding accounts of cerebellar function in socio-emotional communication and highlights the need to consider subtle socio-affective deficits in cerebellar patients.

">Effective connectivity reveals a shift to left-hemisphere dominance for spatial attention with diminishing arousal</a></h4>

              
                In healthy righthanders, spatial attention typically becomes biased to the right side when alertness wanes. The underlying neural mechanisms of healthy spatial attention and these drowsiness-related spatial biases remain contested. Competing theories propose that attention is governed either by the interaction of two bilateral networks (dual-network model) or by a dominant right hemisphere (right hemisphere dominance model). To adjudicate between these models, we investigated how effective connectivity within the auditory cortical hierarchy is modulated by drowsiness. We recorded high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) in 32 healthy participants performing a lateralised auditory localisation task in both awake and drowsy states. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis revealed that arousal states become decodable approximately 150 ms post-stimulus. We used Parametric Empirical Bayes and Dynamic Causal Modelling to map arousal-dependent changes in effective connectivity between left-sided and right-sided auditory stimuli. Consistent with the right hemisphere dominance model of spatial attention, right-sided stimuli elicited stronger bidirectional information flow between bilateral inferior frontal gyri during wakefulness. However, we observed a significant reduction in right-hemispheric frontoparietal connectivity alongside a strengthening of a left-hemispheric pathway from the inferior parietal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus during drowsiness. This finding supports the dual-network theory and conflicts with the right hemisphere theory's prediction of a bilateral decrease in activity during drowsiness. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how diminishing arousal shifts cortical processing from a bilaterally integrated network to a left-lateralised state. Our results therefore support the dual-network model of spatial attention while retaining elements of the right hemisphere model.

">ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations promote fragility of genes governing excitatory neurotransmission via topoisomerase IIβ impairment</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal TAR DNA/RNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization, aggregation, and pathogenic mutations. Altered excitatory neuronal transmission is an early functional defect in these diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neuronal activity can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting a potential link between altered excitability and genomic instability. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TDP-43 is involved in neuronal activity-induced DSBs. Moreover, we show that ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 mutations (A90V and A315T) disrupt this mechanism, leading to the accumulation of DSBs and altered neuronal activity compared to wild-type TDP-43 protein. Using the BLISS technique, we mapped genome-wide DSBs in primary mouse neurons expressing wild-type or mutant (A90V, A315T) TDP-43 and found enrichment of DSBs within genes regulating excitatory transmission. Mechanistically, the TDP-43 A90V mutation impairs topoisomerase II{beta} function, resulting in enzyme trapping and/or DNA supercoiling that predisposes DNA to breaks. Notably, this impairment is partially rescued by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2) overexpression. These findings uncover a novel mechanism linking aberrant neuronal activity and DNA damage, bridging two key pathological hallmarks of ALS/FTD associated with TDP-43 dysfunction. It also paves the way for developing novel therapeutic approaches that rely on targeted DSB repair and/or modulating topoisomerase II{beta}-DNA complexes.
