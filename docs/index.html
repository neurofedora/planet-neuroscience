                arXiv:2412.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long duration spaceflight missions can affect the cognitive and behavioral activities of astronauts due to changes in gravity. The microgravity significantly impacts the central nervous system physiology which causes the degradation in the performance and lead to potential risk in the space exploration. The aim of this study was to evaluate functional connectivity at simulated space conditions using an unloading harness system to mimic the body-weight distribution related to Earth, Mars, and International Space Station. A unity model with six directional arrows to imagine six different motor imagery tasks associated with arms and legs were designed for the Oculus Rift S virtual reality headset for testing. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were recorded from 10 participants in the distributed weight conditions related to Earth, Mars, and International Space station using the g.Nautilus fNIRS system at sampling rate of 500 Hz. The magnitude squared coherence were estimated from left vs right hemisphere of the brain that represents functional connectivity. The EEG coherence was the higher which shows the strong functional connectivity and fNIRS coherence was lower shows weak functional connectivity between left vs right hemisphere of the brain, during all the tasks and trials irrespective of the simulated space conditions. Further analysis of functional connectivity needed between the intra-regions of the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04172">Neuromodulation and homeostasis: complementary mechanisms for robust neural function</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns. Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections, enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation, proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.

                arXiv:2412.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can perform exquisite sensorimotor skills, both individually and in teams, from athletes performing rhythmic gymnastics to everyday tasks like carrying a cup of coffee. The "predictive brain" framework suggests that mastering these tasks relies on predictive mechanisms, raising the question of how we deploy such predictions for real-time control and coordination. This review highlights two lines of research: one showing that during the control of complex objects people make the interaction with 'tools' predictable; the second one examines dyadic coordination showing that people make their behavior predictable for their partners. These studies demonstrate that to achieve sophisticated motor skills, we play "prediction tricks": we select subspaces of predictable solutions and make sensorimotor interactions more predictable and legible by and for others. This synthesis underscores the critical role of predictability in optimizing control strategies across various contexts and establishes a link between predictive processing and closed-loop control theories of behavior.

Abstract: We prove a principle of linearized stability for traveling wave solutions to neural field equations posed on the real line. Additionally, we provide the existence of a finite dimensional invariant center manifold close to a traveling wave, this allows to study bifurcations of traveling waves. Finally, the spectral properties of the modulated traveling waves are investigated. Numerical schemes for the computation of modulated traveling waves are provided. We then apply these results and methods to study a neural field model in a inhibitory stabilized regime. We showcase Fold, Hopf and Bodgdanov-Takens bifurcations of traveling pulses. Additionally, we continue the modulated traveling pulses as function of the time scale ratio of the two neural populations and show numerical evidences for snaking of modulated traveling pulses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04366">Artificial intelligence and the internal processes of creativity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating creative outputs are reshaping our understanding of creativity. This shift presents an opportunity for creativity researchers to reevaluate the key components of the creative process. In particular, the advanced capabilities of AI underscore the importance of studying the internal processes of creativity. This paper explores the neurobiological machinery that underlies these internal processes and describes the experiential component of creativity. It is concluded that although the products of artificial and human creativity can be similar, the internal processes are different. The paper also discusses how AI may negatively affect the internal processes of human creativity, such as the development of skills, the integration of knowledge, and the diversity of ideas.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14334">Probabilistic models, compressible interactions, and neural coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2112.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics we often use very simple models to describe systems with many degrees of freedom, but it is not clear why or how this success can be transferred to the more complex biological context. We consider models for the joint distribution of many variables, as with the combinations of spiking and silence in large networks of neurons. In this probabilistic framework, we argue that simple models are possible if the mutual information between two halves of the system is consistently sub--extensive, and if this shared information is compressible. These conditions are not met generically, but they are met by real world data such as natural images and the activity in a population of retinal output neurons. We introduce compression strategies that combine the information bottleneck with an iteration scheme inspired by the renormalization group, and find that the number of parameters needed to describe the distribution of joint activity scales with the square of the number of neurons, even though the interactions are not well approximated as pairwise. Our results also show that this shared information is essentially equal to the information that individual neurons carry about natural visual inputs, which has surprising implications for the neural code.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01107">Brain Morphology Normative modelling platform for abnormality and Centile estimation: Brain MoNoCle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.01107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normative models of brain structure estimate the effects of covariates such as age and sex using large samples of healthy controls. These models can then be applied to e.g. smaller clinical cohorts to distinguish disease effects from other covariates. However, these advanced statistical modelling approaches can be difficult to access, and processing large healthy cohorts is computationally demanding. Thus, accessible platforms with pre-trained normative models are needed.
  We present such a platform for brain morphology analysis as an open-source web application (https://cnnplab.shinyapps.io/BrainMoNoCle/), with six key features: (i) user-friendly web interface, (ii) individual and group outputs, (iii) multi-site analysis, (iv) regional and whole-brain analysis, (v) integration with existing tools, and (vi) featuring multiple morphology metrics.
  Using a diverse sample of 3,276 healthy controls across 21 sites, we pre-trained normative models on various metrics. We validated the models with a small sample of individuals with bipolar disorder, showing outputs that aligned closely with existing literature only after applying our normative modelling. Using a cohort of people with temporal lobe epilepsy, we showed that individual-level abnormalities were in line with seizure lateralisation. Finally, with the ability to investigate multiple morphology measures in the same framework, we found that biological covariates are better explained in specific morphology measures, and for applications, only some measures are sensitive to the disease process.
  Our platform offers a comprehensive framework to analyse brain morphology in clinical and research settings. Validations confirm the superiority of normative models and the advantage of investigating a range of brain morphology metrics together.

                arXiv:2411.05712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition (COR) behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate visual ventral stream (VVS). While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling model size, dataset size, and compute resources improve task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate VVS by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and COR behaviors. We observe that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive bias and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Finally, we develop a scaling recipe, indicating that a greater proportion of compute should be allocated to data samples over model size. Our results suggest that while scaling alone might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream with current architectures and datasets, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain-like models.

                arXiv:2406.16453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.

                arXiv:2406.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of interconnected neurons communicating through spiking signals offer the bedrock of neural computations. Our brains spiking neural networks have the computational capacity to achieve complex pattern recognition and cognitive functions effortlessly. However, solving real-world problems with artificial spiking neural networks (SNNs) has proved to be difficult for a variety of reasons. Crucially, scaling SNNs to large networks and processing large-scale real-world datasets have been challenging, especially when compared to their non-spiking deep learning counterparts. The critical operation that is needed of SNNs is the ability to learn distributed representations from data and use these representations for perceptual, cognitive and memory operations. In this work, we introduce a novel SNN that performs unsupervised representation learning and associative memory operations leveraging Hebbian synaptic and activity-dependent structural plasticity coupled with neuron-units modelled as Poisson spike generators with sparse firing (~1 Hz mean and ~100 Hz maximum firing rate). Crucially, the architecture of our model derives from the neocortical columnar organization and combines feedforward projections for learning hidden representations and recurrent projections for forming associative memories. We evaluated the model on properties relevant for attractor-based associative memories such as pattern completion, perceptual rivalry, distortion resistance, and prototype extraction.

Abstract: We introduce JPC, a JAX library for training neural networks with Predictive Coding. JPC provides a simple, fast and flexible interface to train a variety of PC networks (PCNs) including discriminative, generative and hybrid models. Unlike existing libraries, JPC leverages ordinary differential equation solvers to integrate the gradient flow inference dynamics of PCNs. We find that a second-order solver achieves significantly faster runtimes compared to standard Euler integration, with comparable performance on a range of tasks and network depths. JPC also provides some theoretical tools that can be used to study PCNs. We hope that JPC will facilitate future research of PC.

                arXiv:2412.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) are prevalent in real-world applications, where the evaluation of a single solution requires a significant amount of resources. In our study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in EOPs, we discovered an intriguing phenomenon. Because only a limited number of solutions are evaluated in each iteration, relying solely on these evaluated solutions for evolution can lead to reduced disparity in successive populations. This, in turn, hampers the reproduction operators' ability to generate superior solutions, thereby reducing the algorithm's convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose a strategic approach that incorporates high-quality, un-evaluated solutions predicted by surrogate models during the selection phase. This approach aims to improve the distribution of evaluated solutions, thereby generating a superior next generation of solutions. This work details specific implementations of this concept across various reproduction operators and validates its effectiveness using multiple surrogate models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly enhances the performance of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Compared to mainstream SAEAs and Bayesian optimization algorithms, our approach incorporating the un-evaluated solution strategy shows a marked improvement.

                arXiv:2412.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the issue of intensification/diversification balance in the context of a memetic algorithm for the multiobjective optimization of investment portfolios with cardinality constraints. We approach this issue in this work by considering the selective application of knowledge-augmented operators (local search and a memory of elite solutions) based on the search epoch in which the algorithm finds itself, hence alternating between unbiased search (guided uniquely by the built-in search mechanics of the algorithm) and focused search (intensified by the use of the problem-aware operators). These operators exploit Sharpe index (a measure of the relationship between return and risk) as a source of problem knowledge. We have conducted a sensibility analysis to determine in which phases of the search the application of these operators leads to better results. Our findings indicate that the resulting algorithm is quite robust in terms of parameterization from the point of view of this problem-specific indicator. Furthermore, it is shown that not only can other non-memetic counterparts be outperformed, but that there is a range of parameters in which the MA is also competitive when not better in terms of standard multiobjective performance indicators.

                arXiv:2412.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.

                arXiv:2412.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.

                arXiv:2412.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of conversion-based neuromorphic algorithms for highly accurate and energy-efficient single-snapshot multidimensional harmonic retrieval (MHR). By casting the MHR problem as a sparse recovery problem, we devise the currently proposed, deep-unrolling-based Structured Learned Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (S-LISTA) algorithm to solve it efficiently using complex-valued convolutional neural networks with complex-valued activations, which are trained using a supervised regression objective. Afterward, a novel method for converting the complex-valued convolutional layers and activations into spiking neural networks (SNNs) is developed. At the heart of this method lies the recently proposed Few Spikes (FS) conversion, which is extended by modifying the neuron model's parameters and internal dynamics to account for the inherent coupling between real and imaginary parts in complex-valued computations. Finally, the converted SNNs are mapped onto the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic board, and a comparison in terms of estimation accuracy and power efficiency between the original CNNs deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier and the SNNs is being conducted. The measurement results show that the converted SNNs achieve almost five-fold power efficiency at moderate performance loss compared to the original CNNs.

                arXiv:2412.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Learning (TGL) is crucial for capturing the evolving nature of stock markets. Traditional methods often ignore the interplay between dynamic temporal changes and static relational structures between stocks. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Graph Representation with Contrastive Learning (DGRCL) framework, which integrates dynamic and static graph relations to improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction. Our framework introduces two key components: the Embedding Enhancement (EE) module and the Contrastive Constrained Training (CCT) module. The EE module focuses on dynamically capturing the temporal evolution of stock data, while the CCT module enforces static constraints based on stock relations, refined within contrastive learning. This dual-relation approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of stock market dynamics. Our experiments on two major U.S. stock market datasets, NASDAQ and NYSE, demonstrate that DGRCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TGL baselines. Ablation studies indicate the importance of both modules. Overall, DGRCL not only enhances prediction ability but also provides a robust framework for integrating temporal and relational data in dynamic graphs. Code and data are available for public access.

Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.

                <p>Goal-directed actions require transforming sensory information into motor plans defined across multiple parameters and reference frames. Substantial evidence supports the encoding of target direction in gaze- and body-centered coordinates within parietal and premotor regions. However, how the brain encodes the equally critical parameter of target distance remains less understood. Here, using Bayesian pattern component modeling of fMRI data during a delayed reach-to-target task, we dissociated the neural encoding of both target direction and the relative distances between target, gaze, and hand at early and late stages of motor planning. This approach revealed independent representations of direction and distance along the human dorsomedial reach pathway. During early planning, most premotor and superior parietal areas encoded a target&rsquo;s distance in single or multiple reference frames and encoded its direction. In contrast, distance encoding was magnified in gaze- and body-centric reference frames during late planning. These results emphasize a flexible and efficient human central nervous system that achieves goals by remapping sensory information related to multiple parameters, such as distance and direction, in the same brain areas.</p>

                Background Surgical procedures on the cervical spine are frequently performed to treat spinal diseases such as degenerative disc degeneration, trauma, tumors, and infections. However, postoperative complications are a cause for concern, and the surgical procedure with the lowest complication risk still unknown. Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out in different databases from the beginning of the study to January 2024. Observational studies that reported the incidence of postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF), laminoplasty, laminectomy with fusion, and corpectomy were included in the review. Outcomes like reoperation rates, infections, and nerve injuries were analyzed using random-effects models, with ORs (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 13 studies with 22,874 patients were included. ACDF was associated with higher complication rates versus PCF (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.60) and laminoplasty (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.41). Laminectomy with fusion showed greater pseudarthrosis (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.90) and reoperation rates (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.43) than ACDF. No differences were detected between other procedures. Conclusion Complications risk significantly differs based on surgical strategy and technique, with ACDF potentially having higher rates compared to less invasive methods.

                Fibroblasts, non-hematopoietic cells of mesenchymal origin, are tissue architects which regulate the topography of tissues, dictate tissue resident cell types, and drive fibrotic disease. Fibroblasts regulate the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a 3-dimensional network of macromolecules that comprise the acellular milieu of tissues. Fibroblasts can directly and indirectly regulate immune responses by secreting ECM and ECM-bound molecules to shape tissue structure and influence organ function. In this review, we will highlight recent studies which elucidate the mechanisms by which fibroblast-derived ECM factors (e.g., collagens, fibrillar proteins) regulate ECM architecture and subsequent immune responses, with a focus on macrophages. As examples of fibroblast-derived ECM proteins, we examine Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1 (CTHRC1) and Transforming Growth Factor-β-inducible protein (TGFBI), also known as BIGH3. We address the need for investigation into how diverse fibroblast populations coordinate immune responses by modulating ECM, including the fibroblast-ECM-immune axis and the precise molecular mediators and pathways which regulate these processes. Finally, we will outline how novel research identifying key regulators of ECM deposition is critical for therapeutic development for fibrotic diseases and cancer.

                <p>by Michael Forrester, Sammy Petros, Oliver Cattell, Yi Ming Lai, Reuben D. O’Dea, Stamatios Sotiropoulos, Stephen Coombes</p>

The ready availability of brain connectome data has both inspired and facilitated the modelling of whole brain activity using networks of phenomenological neural mass models that can incorporate both interaction strength and tract length between brain regions. Recently, a new class of neural mass model has been developed from an exact mean field reduction of a network of spiking cortical cell models with a biophysically realistic model of the chemical synapse. Moreover, this new population dynamics model can naturally incorporate electrical synapses. Here we demonstrate the ability of this new modelling framework, when combined with data from the Human Connectome Project, to generate patterns of functional connectivity (FC) of the type observed in both magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. Some limited explanatory power is obtained via an eigenmode description of frequency-specific FC patterns, obtained via a linear stability analysis of the network steady state in the neigbourhood of a Hopf bifurcation. However, direct numerical simulations show that empirical data is more faithfully recapitulated in the nonlinear regime, and exposes a key role of gap junction coupling strength in generating empirically-observed neural activity, and associated FC patterns and their evolution. Thereby, we emphasise the importance of maintaining known links with biological reality when developing multi-scale models of brain dynamics. As a tool for the study of dynamic whole brain models of the type presented here we further provide a suite of C++ codes for the efficient, and user friendly, simulation of neural mass networks with multiple delayed interactions.

                <p>by Gene J. Yu, Federico Ranieri, Vincenzo Di Lazzaro, Marc A. Sommer, Angel V. Peterchev, Warren M. Grill</p>

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.

                <p>by Hind Zaaraoui, Clarisse Schumer, Xavier Duval, Bruno Hoen, Lulla Opatowski, Jérémie Guedj</p>

Households are a major driver of transmission of acute respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza. Until now antiviral treatments have mostly been used as a curative treatment in symptomatic individuals. During an outbreak, more aggressive strategies involving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP or PEP) could be employed to further reduce the risk of severe disease but also prevent transmission to household contacts. In order to understand the effectiveness of such strategies and the factors that may modulate them, we developed a multi-scale model that follows the infection at both the individual-level (viral dynamics) and the population-level (transmission dynamics) in households. Using a simulation study we explored different antiviral treatment strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on reducing the transmission risk and the virological burden in households for a range of virus characteristics (e.g., secondary attack rate—SAR, or time to peak viral load). We found that when the index case can be identified and treated before symptom onset, both transmission and virological burden are reduced by > 75% for most SAR values and time to peak viral load, with minimal benefit to treat additionally household contacts. While treatment initiated after index symptom onset does not reduce the risk of transmission, it can still reduce the virological burden in the household, a proxy for severe disease and subsequent transmission risk outside the household. In that case optimal strategies involve treatment of both index case and household contacts as PEP, with efficacy > 50% when peak viral load occurs after symptom onset, and 30-50% otherwise. In all the considered cases, antiviral treatment strategies were optimal for SAR ranging 20-60%, and for larger household sizes. This study highlights the opportunity of antiviral drug-based interventions in households during an outbreak to minimize viral transmission and disease burden.

                <p>by Nan Zhang, Linan Zhuang, Marco-Felipe King, Hua Qian, Min Zhu</p>

Norovirus, primarily transmitted via fomite route, poses a significant threat to global public health and the economy. Airports, as critical transportation hubs connecting people from around the world, has high potential risk of norovirus transmission due to large number of public surfaces. A total of 21.3 hours of video episodes were recorded across nine functional areas at the airport, capturing 25,925 touches. A surface transmission model based on a Markov chain was developed. Using the beta-Poisson dose-response model, the infection risk of norovirus and the effectiveness of various interventions in different airports’ areas were quantified. Without any preventive measures, restaurants at airports exhibited the highest risk of norovirus transmission, with an infection probability of 8.8×10<sup>−3</sup>% (95% CI, 1.5×10<sup>−3</sup>% -2.1×10<sup>−2</sup>%). This means approximately 4.6 (95% CI, 0.8–10.9) out of 51,494 passengers who entered the restaurants would be infected by an infected passenger. Comparing with no surface disinfection, disinfecting public surfaces every 2 hours can reduce the risk of norovirus infection per visit to the airport by 83.2%. In contrast, comparing with no hand washing, handwashing every 2 hours can reduce the infection risk per visit to the airport by only 2.0%, making public surface disinfection significantly more effective than handwashing. If the mask-wearing rate increases from 0% to 50%, the infection risk of norovirus would be decreased by 48.0% (95% CI, 43.5–52.3%). Furthermore, using antimicrobial copper/copper-nickel alloy coatings for most public surfaces could reduce the infection risk by 15.9%-99.2%.

To keep ahead of the evolution of resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes, national malaria control programmes must make use of a range of insecticides, both old and new, while monitoring resistance mechanisms. The outdoor-biting malaria vector <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> is of increasing concern for malaria transmission because it is apparently less susceptible to many indoor control interventions, yet knowledge of its mechanisms of resistance remains limited. Furthermore, comparatively little is known in general about resistance to non-pyrethroid insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl (PM), which are crucial for effective control in the context of globally high resistance to pyrethroids. We performed a genome-wide association study to determine the molecular mechanisms of resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin (commonly used in bednets) and PM (widespread use for indoor spraying), in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> from 2 regions in Tanzania. Genomic regions of positive selection in these populations were largely driven by copy number variants (CNVs) in gene families involved in metabolic resistance. We found evidence of a new gene cluster involved in resistance to PM, identifying a strong selective sweep tied to a CNV in the carboxylesterase genes <i>Coeae2g - Coeae6g</i>. Using complementary data from another malaria vector, <i>An</i>. <i>coluzzii</i>, in Ghana, we show that copy number at this locus is significantly associated with PM resistance. Similarly, for deltamethrin, resistance was strongly associated with a novel CNV allele in the <i>Cyp6aa</i> / <i>Cyp6p</i> cluster (<i>Cyp6aap</i>_Dup33). Against this background of metabolic resistance, resistance caused by mutations in the insecticide target sites was very rare or absent. Mutations in the pyrethroid target site <i>Vgsc</i> were at very low frequency in Tanzania, yet combining these samples with 3 <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> individuals from West Africa revealed a startling evolutionary diversity, with up to 5 independent origins of <i>Vgsc</i>-995 mutations found within just 8 haplotypes. Thus, despite having been first recorded over 10 years ago, <i>Vgsc</i> resistance mutations in Tanzanian <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> have remained at stable low frequencies. Overall, our results provide a new copy number marker for monitoring resistance to PM in malaria mosquitoes, and reveal the complex picture of resistance patterns in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i>.

Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision, which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms in eukaryotes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf598 recognizes collided ribosomes, triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs. However, the impact of RQC and NGD on maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish development. RNA-Seq analysis of zebrafish <i>znf598</i> mutant embryos revealed that Znf598 down-regulates mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) during the MZT. Reporter assays and disome profiling indicated that ribosomes stall and collide while translating tandem C2H2-ZFs, leading to mRNA degradation by Znf598. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF sequences in the vertebrate genome.

                <p>by Grant Kinsler, Yuping Li, Gavin Sherlock, Dmitri A. Petrov</p>

Evolution by natural selection is expected to be a slow and gradual process. In particular, the mutations that drive evolution are predicted to be small and modular, incrementally improving a small number of traits. However, adaptive mutations identified early in microbial evolution experiments, cancer, and other systems often provide substantial fitness gains and pleiotropically improve multiple traits at once. We asked whether such pleiotropically adaptive mutations are common throughout adaptation or are instead a rare feature of early steps in evolution that tend to target key signaling pathways. To do so, we conducted barcoded second-step evolution experiments initiated from 5 first-step mutations identified from a prior yeast evolution experiment. We then isolated hundreds of second-step mutations from these evolution experiments, measured their fitness and performance in several growth phases, and conducted whole genome sequencing of the second-step clones. Here, we found that while the vast majority of mutants isolated from the first-step of evolution in this condition show patterns of pleiotropic adaptation—improving both performance in fermentation and respiration growth phases—second-step mutations show a shift towards modular adaptation, mostly improving respiration performance and only rarely improving fermentation performance. We also identified a shift in the molecular basis of adaptation from genes in cellular signaling pathways towards genes involved in respiration and mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that the genes in cellular signaling pathways may be more likely to provide large, adaptively pleiotropic benefits to the organism due to their ability to coherently affect many phenotypes at once. As such, these genes may serve as the source of pleiotropic adaptation in the early stages of evolution, and once these become exhausted, organisms then adapt more gradually, acquiring smaller, more modular mutations.

                <p>by Lily D. Peck, Theo Llewellyn, Bastien Bennetot, Samuel O’Donnell, Reuben W. Nowell, Matthew J. Ryan, Julie Flood, Ricardo C. Rodríguez de la Vega, Jeanne Ropars, Tatiana Giraud, Pietro D. Spanu, Timothy G. Barraclough</p>

Outbreaks of fungal diseases have devastated plants and animals throughout history. Over the past century, the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium xylarioides</i> severely impacted coffee production across sub-Saharan Africa. To improve the disease management of such pathogens, it is crucial to understand their genetic structure and evolutionary potential. We compared the genomes of 13 historic strains spanning 6 decades and multiple disease outbreaks to investigate population structure and host specialisation. We found that <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> comprised at least 4 distinct lineages: 1 host-specific to <i>Coffea arabica</i>, 1 to <i>C</i>. <i>canephora</i> var. robusta, and 2 historic lineages isolated from various <i>Coffea</i> species. The presence/absence of large genomic regions across populations, the higher genetic similarities of these regions between species than expected based on genome-wide divergence and their locations in different loci in genomes across populations showed that horizontal transfers of effector genes from members of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> species complex contributed to host specificity. Multiple transfers into <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> populations matched different parts of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> mobile pathogenicity chromosome and were enriched in effector genes and transposons. Effector genes in this region and other carbohydrate-active enzymes important in the breakdown of plant cell walls were shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection of <i>C</i>. <i>arabica</i> by the fungal arabica strains. Widespread sharing of specific transposons between <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> and <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>, and the correspondence of a putative horizontally transferred regions to a <i>Starship</i> (large mobile element involved in horizontal gene transfers in fungi), reinforce the inference of horizontal transfers and suggest that mobile elements were involved. Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfers contributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1488/v1?src=rss">Addressing common inferential mistakes when failing to reject the null-hypothesis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Failure to reject a null hypothesis may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the absence of an association or inadequate statistical power. Because an estimate (and its variance) can never be exactly zero, traditional statistical tests cannot conclusively demonstrate the absence of an association. Instead, estimates of accuracy should be used to identify settings in which an association and its variability are sufficiently small to be clinically acceptable, directly providing information on safety and efficacy. Post-hoc power calculations should be avoided, as they offer no additional information beyond statistical tests and p-values. Furthermore, post-hoc power calculations can be misleading because of an inability to distinguish between results based on insufficient sample size and results that reflect clinically irrelevant differences. Most multiple testing procedures unrealistically assume that all positive results are false positives. However, in applied settings, results typically represent a mix of true and false positives. This implies that multiplicity corrections do not effectively differentiate between true and false positives. Instead, considering the distributions of p-values and the proportion of significant results can help to identify bodies of evidence unlikely to be driven by false-positive results. In conclusion, rather than attempting to categorize results as true or false, medical research should embrace established statistical methods that focus on estimation accuracy, replication, and consistency.

                Background This paper investigated the connection between transactional leadership styles, contingent rewards, punishments, and employee performance while emphasizing employee engagement’s mediating role. Existing research has predominantly focused on isolated associations between contingent rewards, punishment, and employee performance, leaving gaps in the empirical exploration of these mediating mechanisms. To address this research gap, our study has introduced a conceptual framework to understand the multifaceted connection between contingent rewards, punishment, and their effects on employee performance, with a specific emphasis on the mediating function of employee engagement. Methods We involved 273 full-time non-clinical healthcare professionals employed in NABH-accredited hospitals in Jharkhand, India. A structured survey instrument was employed for data collection from the specific survey participants, with the investigation of the research hypotheses conducted through the application of partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Preliminary findings suggested that contingent rewards and punishment do not directly influence employee performance. Instead, our study highlighted the critical mediating role of employee engagement, particularly its dimensions of Vigor, absorption, and dedication. Conclusions This research has underscored rewards and punishments as essential tools for influencing employee behaviour, motivation, and performance. Employee engagement, as a multifaceted construct, not only benefits individual employees but also significantly impacts overall organizational performance and success.

                Background The practice of preoperative hair removal has been debated regarding its role in Surgical Site Infection (SSI) prevention. This study aimed to compare the different hair removing modalities and investigate the effect of preoperative hair removal on SSI rates. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Three databases—PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library—were searched for relevant studies comparing preoperative hair removal to no hair removal. Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies reporting SSI rates. Odds ratios, mean differences, and p-values were analyzed using a random effect model. Results Seventeen studies involving 5,407 patients were included. No statistically significant difference in SSI rates was found between the hair removal and no removal groups (OR = 1.066, 95% CI 0.646–1.758, p = 0.803). When comparing clipping to no hair removal, there was no significant difference (OR = 0.967, 95% CI 0.642–1.455, p = 0.870). Razor shaving was associated with higher skin damage and slightly increased SSI risk compared to clipping but not statistically significant (OR = 0.749, 95% CI 0.346–1.623, p = 0.464). Depilatory creams, however, were favored over razor shaving (OR = 3.235, 95% CI 1.543–6.785, p = 0.002), as they were linked to less skin damage and easier application. Conclusion Preoperative hair removal does not significantly impact SSI rates. Clipping appears to be a safer alternative to shaving, while depilatory creams show promise as an effective, less damaging option.

                Introduction Given the worldwide prevalence of tooth wear and wear related to dental erosion a baseline understanding of the knowledge of populations related to erosive wear is required to maximize public health campaigns developed to address this condition. This research investigated the awareness of dental erosion, its causes, and protective factors among the general adult population of Trinidad and Tobago. Methods An anonymous de-novo questionnaire, developed using Google Forms and aligned with the CHERRIES framework for web-based surveys, was subjected to face validity to ensure the inclusion of content relevant to erosive tooth wear and clarity of items intended for a general population. The questionnaire was deployed on social media platforms (Facebook) and groups (WhatsApp Community Groups) specific to groups in Trinidad and Tobago for four months. Data was entered into SPSS (Version 29) and analyzed using cross-tabulations and Chi-squared tests. Results Of the 210 respondents, 39.2% had previously been diagnosed with tooth wear, 43.1 % believed they could identify erosive wear and 42.1% believed they could differentiate between predominantly erosive wear and dental caries. Sixty-two point nine percent of respondents identified sensitivity as a symptom of erosive tooth wear. Chi-squared tests on cross-tabulated data showed significant relationships between age and GERD causing erosive wear (p=0.03), heartburn causing erosive wear (p=0.049), eating disorders causing erosive wear (p=0.009), disorders with excessive vomiting causing erosive wear (p=0.005), excessive wine consumption (p=0.004). There were no significant statistical significances for cross-tabulated data on sex and the responses on causative factors. Conclusions Respondents were generally knowledgeable about the various types of foods, beverages, and medical conditions that may cause dental erosion but were unfamiliar with other factors that may influence erosion or protect against dental erosion.

                Background The objective of the research was to analyze e-mails exchanged at Enron, a power company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 following an investigation into unethical operations regarding their financials. Methods Like other researchers, we identify the “most important” employees and detect “communities” using network science methods. In addition, because previous work required that 10 e-mails be sent and received for an e-mail relationship to exist, we analyzed the effect of different “thresholds” on the results. We also performed sentiment analyses on the e-mails to evaluate whether sentiment changed over time. Results We find that the “importance” of a person depends on the centrality measure used; while the communities we detected resembled the formal organizational structure of the company. In addition, we found that centrality results were very dependent on the “threshold” used. Finally, analysis of email sentiment over time = do not give insight into the financial wellbeing of Enron. Conclusion Our results provide insight into how information flowed through Enron, who the key employees were, and e-mail sentiment before and after the crisis.

                Background The extension of hydatid liver cysts into the mediastinum through diaphragmatic hiatus is extremely rare. In this report, we describe a rare case of a hydatid liver cyst with mediastinal extension through Larrey’s hiatus, emphasizing the surgical strategy for successful treatment. In this report, we present the first documented case of a hydatid liver cyst extending into the mediastinum through Larrey’s hiatus. Case presentation We report the case of a 65-year-old male who presented with right-upper-quadrant and left-sided chest pain evolving for two months. Physical examination showed dullnes in the epigastric region. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan, revealed a 13 cm mediastino-abdominal hydatid cyst, centered on the left liver lobe with extension into the mediastinum through the Larray’s diaphragmatic hiatus. The patient underwent surgical management. Both thoracic and visceral surgeons were involved. The surgical management involved both thoracic and visceral surgeons. A Makuuchi incision allowed resection of the hydatid liver cyst. The mediastinal portion of the cyst, resting on the pericardium was aspirated through Larrey’s hiatus, followed by irrigation with a scolicidal solution. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion Transmediastinal hydatid liver cysts are rare and should be operated on in close collaboration between visceral and thoracic surgeons to prevent complications.

                The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic were a global challenge, and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of virus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs has become a common tool to confirm the clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. Available evidence suggests, that Whatman™ Flinders Technology Associates™ (FTA) cards are a reliable option for the safe transport and storage of viral RNA pathogens. In 2021 FTA cards were shown to be suitable for the stable preservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA derived from nasopharyngeal swabs even at elevated storage temperatures. Subsequently, another study identified Whatman filter paper to be a cheaper alternative with respect to the stable storage SARS-CoV-2 RNA at room temperature. This correspondence is meant to discuss the performance of both FTA cards and filter paper also scrutinizing performance calculations and respective evaluations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100446">A novel monomeric amyloid β-activated signaling pathway regulates brain development via inhibition of microglia</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid β (Aβ) forms aggregates in the Alzheimer’s disease brain and is well known for its pathological roles. Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether Aβ also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of Aβ in vitro that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during mouse development in vivo. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor and the heterotrimeric G protein regulator Ric8a in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of Aβ as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Considering the prominence of Aβ and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of Aβ monomer depletion in the development of the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100569">β-1,6-Glucan plays a central role in the structure and remodeling of the bilaminate fungal cell wall</a></h4>

              
                The cell wall of human fungal pathogens plays critical roles as an architectural scaffold and as a target and modulator of the host immune response. Although the cell wall of the pathogenic yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> is intensively studied, one of the major fibrillar components in its cell wall, β-1,6-glucan, has been largely neglected. Here, we show that β-1,6-glucan is essential for bilayered cell wall organization, cell wall integrity, and filamentous growth. For the first time, we show that β-1,6-glucan production compensates the defect in mannan elongation in the outer layer of the cell wall. In addition, β-1,6-glucan dynamics are also coordinated by host environmental stimuli and stresses with wall remodeling, where the regulation of β-1,6-glucan structure and chain length is a crucial process. As we point out that β-1,6-glucan is exposed at the yeast surface and modulate immune response, β-1,6-glucan must be considered a key factor in host–pathogen interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102702">Parallel mechanisms signal a hierarchy of sequence structure violations in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The brain predicts regularities in sensory inputs at multiple complexity levels, with neuronal mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at the sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons, respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99424">Multisensory integration enhances audiovisual responses in the Mauthner cell</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration (MSI) combines information from multiple sensory modalities to create a coherent perception of the world. In contexts where sensory information is limited or equivocal, it also allows animals to integrate individually ambiguous stimuli into a clearer or more accurate percept and, thus, react with a more adaptive behavioral response. Although responses to multisensory stimuli have been described at the neuronal and behavioral levels, a causal or direct link between these two is still missing. In this study, we studied the integration of audiovisual inputs in the Mauthner cell, a command neuron necessary and sufficient to trigger a stereotypical escape response in fish. We performed intracellular recordings in adult goldfish while presenting a diverse range of stimuli to determine which stimulus properties affect their integration. Our results show that stimulus modality, intensity, temporal structure, and interstimulus delay affect input summation. Mechanistically, we found that the distinct decay dynamics of FFI triggered by auditory and visual stimuli can account for certain aspects of input integration. Altogether, this is a rare example of the characterization of MSI in a cell with clear behavioral relevance, providing both phenomenological and mechanistic insights into how MSI depends on stimulus properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91522">When abstract becomes concrete, naturalistic encoding of concepts in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts, involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects, etc. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. First, across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90254">Minimal twister sister-like self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome revealed by deep mutational scanning</a></h4>

              
                Despite their importance in a wide range of living organisms, self-cleaving ribozymes in the human genome are few and poorly studied. Here, we performed deep mutational scanning and covariance analysis of two previously proposed self-cleaving ribozymes (LINE-1 and OR4K15). We found that the regions essential for ribozyme activities are made of two short segments, with a total of 35 and 31 nucleotides only. The discovery makes them the simplest known self-cleaving ribozymes. Moreover, the essential regions are circular permutated with two nearly identical catalytic internal loops, supported by two stems of different lengths. These two self-cleaving ribozymes, which are shaped like lanterns, are similar to the catalytic regions of the twister sister ribozymes in terms of sequence and secondary structure. However, the nucleotides at the cleavage site have shown that mutational effects on two twister sister-like (TS-like) ribozymes are different from the twister sister ribozyme. The discovery of TS-like ribozymes reveals a ribozyme class with the simplest and, perhaps, the most primitive structure needed for self-cleavage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93493">Distinct T-cell receptor (TCR) gene segment usage and MHC-restriction between foetal and adult thymus</a></h4>

              
                Here, we sequenced rearranged TCRβ and TCRα chain sequences in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> single positive (SP4) and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (SP8) thymocyte populations from the foetus and young adult mouse. We found that life-stage had a greater impact on TCRβ and TCRα gene segment usage than cell-type. Foetal repertoires showed bias towards 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ rearrangements in all populations, whereas adult repertoires used more 5’TRAV gene segments, suggesting that progressive TCRα rearrangements occur less frequently in foetal DP cells. When we synchronised young adult DP thymocyte differentiation by hydrocortisone treatment the new recovering DP thymocyte population showed more foetal-like 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ gene segment usage. In foetus we identified less influence of MHC-restriction on α-chain and β-chain combinatorial VxJ usage and CDR1xCDR2 (V region) usage in SP compared to adult, indicating weaker impact of MHC-restriction on the foetal TCR repertoire. The foetal TCRβ repertoire was less diverse, less evenly distributed, with fewer non-template insertions, and all foetal populations contained more clonotypic expansions than adult. The differences between the foetal and adult thymus TCR repertoires are consistent with the foetal thymus producing αβT-cells with properties and functions that are distinct from adult T-cells: their repertoire is less governed by MHC-restriction, with preference for particular gene segment usage, less diverse with more clonotypic expansions, and more closely encoded by genomic sequence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88584">Spinal neural tube formation and tail development in human embryos</a></h4>

              
                Primary and secondary neurulation – processes that form the spinal cord – are incompletely understood in humans, largely due to the challenge of accessing neurulation-stage embryos (3–7 weeks post-conception). Here, we describe findings from 108 human embryos, spanning Carnegie stages (CS) 10–18. Primary neurulation is completed at the posterior neuropore with neural plate bending that is similar, but not identical, to the mouse. Secondary neurulation proceeds from CS13 with formation of a single lumen as in mouse, not coalescence of multiple lumens as in chick. There is no evidence of a ‘transition zone’ from primary to secondary neurulation. Secondary neural tube ‘splitting’ occurs in 60% of proximal human tail regions. A somite is formed every 7 hr in human, compared with 2 hr in mice and a 5 hr ‘segmentation clock’ in human organoids. Termination of axial elongation occurs after down-regulation of <i>WNT3A</i> and <i>FGF8</i> in the CS15 embryonic tailbud, with a ‘burst’ of apoptosis that may remove neuro-mesodermal progenitors. Hence, the main differences between human and mouse/rat spinal neurulation relate to timing. Investigators are now attempting to recapitulate neurulation events in stem cell-derived organoids, and our results provide ‘normative data’ for interpretation of such research findings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92499">PfMORC protein regulates chromatin accessibility and transcriptional repression in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum</a></h4>

              
                The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that <i>Pf</i>MORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggests that <i>Pf</i>MORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of <i>Pf</i>MORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that <i>Pf</i>MORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93004">A conserved cell-pole determinant organizes proper polar flagellum formation</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of cell cycle progression and flagellar synthesis is a complex process in motile bacteria. In γ-proteobacteria, the localization of the flagellum to the cell pole is mediated by the SRP-type GTPase FlhF. However, the mechanism of action of FlhF, and its relationship with the cell pole landmark protein HubP remain unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel protein called FipA that is required for normal FlhF activity and function in polar flagellar synthesis. We demonstrated that membrane-localized FipA interacts with FlhF and is required for normal flagellar synthesis in <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, and <i>Shewanella putrefaciens</i>, and it does so independently of the polar localization mediated by HubP. FipA exhibits a dynamic localization pattern and is present at the designated pole before flagellar synthesis begins, suggesting its role in licensing flagellar formation. This discovery provides insight into a new pathway for regulating flagellum synthesis and coordinating cellular organization in bacteria that rely on polar flagellation and FlhF-dependent localization.

                The gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional signaling between the intestine and the nervous system and is critical for organism-wide homeostasis. Here, we report the identification of a peptidergic endocrine circuit in which bidirectional signaling between neurons and the intestine potentiates the activation of the antioxidant response in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in the intestine. We identify an FMRF-amide-like peptide, FLP-2, whose release from the intestine is necessary and sufficient to activate the intestinal oxidative stress response by promoting the release of the antioxidant FLP-1 neuropeptide from neurons. FLP-2 secretion from the intestine is positively regulated by endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) produced in the mitochondrial matrix by <i>sod-3</i>/superoxide dismutase, and is negatively regulated by <i>prdx-2</i>/peroxiredoxin, which depletes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in both the mitochondria and cytosol. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promotes FLP-2 secretion through the DAG and calcium-dependent protein kinase C family member <i>pkc-2</i> and by the SNAP25 family member <i>aex-4</i> in the intestine. Together, our data demonstrate a role for intestinal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in promoting inter-tissue antioxidant signaling through regulated neuropeptide-like protein exocytosis in a gut-brain axis to activate the oxidative stress response.

                Entorhinal grid cells implement a spatial code with hexagonal periodicity, signaling the position of the animal within an environment. Grid maps of cells belonging to the same module share spacing and orientation, only differing in relative two-dimensional spatial phase, which could result from being part of a two-dimensional attractor guided by path integration. However, this architecture has the drawbacks of being complex to construct and rigid, path integration allowing for no deviations from the hexagonal pattern such as the ones observed under a variety of experimental manipulations. Here, we show that a simpler one-dimensional attractor is enough to align grid cells equally well. Using topological data analysis, we show that the resulting population activity is a sample of a torus, while the ensemble of maps preserves features of the network architecture. The flexibility of this low dimensional attractor allows it to negotiate the geometry of the representation manifold with the feedforward inputs, rather than imposing it. More generally, our results represent a proof of principle against the intuition that the architecture and the representation manifold of an attractor are topological objects of the same dimensionality, with implications to the study of attractor networks across the brain.

                Hematopoietic dysfunction has been associated with a reduction in the number of active precursors. However, precursor quantification at homeostasis and under diseased conditions is constrained by the scarcity of available methods. To address this issue, we optimized a method for quantifying a wide range of hematopoietic precursors. Assuming the random induction of a stable label in precursors following a binomial distribution, estimates depend on the inverse correlation between precursor numbers and the variance of precursor labeling among independent samples. Experimentally validated to cover the full dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice (1–10<sup>5</sup>), we utilized this approach to demonstrate that thousands of precursors, which emerge after modest expansion during fetal-to-adult transition, contribute to native and perturbed hematopoiesis. We further estimated the number of precursors in a mouse model of Fanconi Anemia, showcasing how repopulation deficits can be classified as autologous (cell proliferation) and non-autologous (lack of precursor). Our results support an accessible and reliable approach for precursor quantification, emphasizing the contemporary perspective that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal.

">Octopamine signals coordinate the spatial pattern of presynaptic machineries in the Drosophila mushroom bodies</a></h4>

              
                Neurons possess numerous synaptic terminals. Presynaptic structures in a single motor neuron exhibit heterogeneity that associated with distinct characters of synaptic vesicle release. However, such heterogeneity is scarcely reported in the central nervous system, and its regulatory mechanism remain unknown. Here, we explored the intracellular diversity of presynaptic structures within the Kenyon cells of the Drosophila mushroom bodies. Applying the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated split-GFP tagging, we devised cell-type specific fluorescent labeling of the endogenous active zone scaffold protein, Bruchpilot (Brp). Morphometry of individual Brp clusters revealed heterogenous accumulations among the axon terminal compartments. Mechanistically, the localized octopaminergic signaling along Kenyon cell terminals regulate the Brp heterogeneity via Octbeta2R and cAMP signaling. We further found that acute food deprivation reduced the compartmental heterogeneity of Brp accumulation in an octopaminergic signaling-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with the mushroom body functions in integrating the signals of changing physiological states.

">Synapse profiling of identified neurons in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are highly heterogeneous even within a single motor neuron in Drosophila melanogaster. In the central nervous system (CNS), the degree of stereotypy in the synaptic structure of specific neurons across individuals remains largely unexplored, due to the significant effort required to analyze multiple brain samples. Utilizing the split-GFP fluorescence-tagging, we achieved endogenous labeling of the presynaptic active zone (AZ) scaffold protein Bruchpilot (Brp) in a cell-type-specific manner. This strategy allowed us to devise a high-throughput quantification pipeline to characterize and compare cell-type-specific AZ structures across individuals. We found that multiple structural parameters such as Brp localization and AZ size revealed significant intracellular synaptic heterogeneity and cell-type-dependent stereotypy in the mushroom body (MB) circuit. Furthermore, we found that the AZ organization can be surprisingly local, even at the neighboring AZ level. These findings therefore suggest multi-level organizations of AZs, from neighboring synapses to across individuals.

">Analyzing Differences in Processing Nouns and Verbs in the Human Brain using Combined EEG and MEG Measurements</a></h4>

              
                Language and consequently the ability to transmit and spread complex information is unique to the human species. The disruptive event of the introduction of large language models has shown that the ability to process language alone leads to incredible abilities and, to some extent, to intelligence. However, how language is processed in the human brain remains elusive. Many insights originate from fMRI studies, as the high spatial resolution of fMRI devices provides valid information about where things happen. Nevertheless, the limited temporal resolution prevents us from gaining a deep understanding on the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we performed combined EEG and MEG measurements in 29 healthy right-handed human subjects during the presentation of continuous speech. We compared the evoked potentials (ERPs and ERFs) for different word types in source space and sensor space across the whole brain. We found characteristic spatio-temporal patterns for different word types (nouns, verbs) especially at latencies of 300 ms to 1 s. This is further emphasized by the fact that we observe these effects in two pre-defined sub-samples of the data set (exploration and validation sample). We expect this study to be the starting point for further evaluations of semantic and syntactic processing in the brain.

">Temporal and Hemispheric Dynamics in Neural Processing of Auditory and Speech Stimuli Across Linguistic Complexity: A MEG Source Space Study</a></h4>

              
                In this study we investigated the neural processing of auditory stimuli of varying complexity: a non-linguistic (pure tone), a simple linguistic (phoneme) and a complex linguistic (word) stimulus. We recorded brain activity of 30 healthy, right-handed participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and compared the resulting evoked fields (ERFs) in source space in three different time intervals, i.e. early (0-250ms), mid (250-500ms) and late (500-750ms) responses. Our results reveal a bilateral activation during early response and right-lateralized activation in the mid-phase for all stimuli. Hoewever, the late response exhibited lateralization variations. The pure tone predominantly activated the right hemisphere, consistent with pitch processing theories. The phoneme primarily engaged the left hemisphere, supporting its role in phonemic processing. Notably, the word elicited activation in both hemispheres, reflecting phonemic processing on the left and stress patterns on the right. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between temporal processing and hemispheric lateralization in speech perception, emphasizing the importance of stimulus complexity and temporal dynamics in understanding auditory and speech processing.

	<p>Background and aim: While conventional MS rehabilitation primarily addresses physical and cognitive symptoms, recent advances in VR technology offer immersive environments that facilitate both emotional and cognitive skill development. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of VR-based training on emotional self-efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and examine its association with cognitive function improvement. Additionally, this study aims to explore potential gender differences in these outcomes, hypothesizing that gender may influence the effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation, which could inform more tailored approaches for emotional and cognitive rehabilitation in MS. Method: The present retrospective study analyzed data from 43 MS patients undergoing cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation at the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi &amp;amp;ldquo;Bonino Pulejo&amp;amp;rdquo; in Italy, comparing a VR intervention group (VR-G) and a control group receiving traditional rehabilitation. Emotional self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety were assessed, alongside cognitive function pre- and post-intervention. Results: Findings indicate that the VR-G showed significant improvements in managing negative emotions, reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, and enhanced cognitive performance, particularly in verbal learning and working memory. Gender-based analysis revealed a trend suggesting that females in the VR-G may exhibit greater improvements in positive emotional self-efficacy, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation highlighted associations between emotional self-efficacy and cognitive gains, supporting the potential of VR to foster both emotional and cognitive resilience. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR training may provide a tailored approach for MS rehabilitation, enhancing therapeutic outcomes by integrating emotional and cognitive training in an immersive setting. Further research should investigate long-term effects and neurophysiological correlates of VR training to optimize MS rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>Area TE is required for normal learning of visual categories based on perceptual similarity. To evaluate whether category learning changes neural activity in area TE, we trained two monkeys (both male) implanted with multielectrode arrays to categorize natural images of cats and dogs. Neural activity during a passive viewing task was compared pre- and post-training. After the category training, the accuracy of abstract category decoding improved. Single units became more category selective, the proportion of single units with category selectivity increased, and units sustained their category-specific responses for longer. Visual category learning thus appears to enhance category separability in area TE by driving changes in the stimulus selectivity of individual neurons and by recruiting more units to the active network.</p>

                <p>Although neurons release neurotransmitter before contact, the role for this release in synapse formation remains unclear. Cortical synapses do not require synaptic vesicle release for formation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B90">Verhage et al., 2000</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B71">Sando et al., 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B75">Sigler et al., 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B36">Held et al., 2020</cross-ref>), yet glutamate clearly regulates glutamate receptor trafficking (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B67">Roche et al., 2001</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Nong et al., 2004</cross-ref>) and induces spine formation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B27">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B82">Toni et al., 1999</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B46">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B60">Oh et al., 2016</cross-ref>). Using rat and murine culture systems to dissect molecular mechanisms, we found that glutamate rapidly decreases synapse density specifically in young cortical neurons in a local and calcium-dependent manner through decreasing <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) transport and surface expression as well as cotransport with neuroligin (NL1). Adhesion between NL1 and neurexin 1 protects against this glutamate-induced synapse loss. Major histocompatibility I (MHCI) molecules are required for the effects of glutamate in causing synapse loss through negatively regulating NL1 levels in both sexes. Thus, like acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, glutamate acts as a dispersal signal for NMDARs and causes rapid synapse loss unless opposed by NL1-mediated trans-synaptic adhesion. Together, glutamate, MHCI, and NL1 mediate a novel form of homeostatic plasticity in young neurons that induces rapid changes in NMDARs to regulate when and where nascent glutamatergic synapses are formed.</p>

                <p>While humans typically saccade every ~250&nbsp;ms in natural settings, studies on vision tend to prevent or restrict eye movements. As it takes ~50&nbsp;ms to initiate and execute a saccade, this leaves only ~200&nbsp;ms to identify the fixated object and select the next saccade goal. How much detail can be derived about parafoveal objects in this short time interval, during which foveal processing and saccade planning both occur? Here, we had male and female human participants freely explore a set of natural images while we recorded magnetoencephalography and eye movements. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we demonstrate that future parafoveal images could be decoded at the feature and category level with peak decoding at ~110 and ~165&nbsp;ms, respectively, while the decoding of fixated objects at the feature and category level peaked at ~100 and ~145&nbsp;ms. The decoding of features and categories was contingent on the objects being saccade goals. In sum, we provide insight on the neuronal mechanism of presaccadic attention by demonstrating that feature- and category-specific information of foveal and parafoveal objects can be extracted in succession within a ~200&nbsp;ms intersaccadic interval. These findings rule out strict serial or parallel processing accounts but are consistent with a pipeline mechanism in which foveal and parafoveal objects are processed in parallel but at different levels in the visual hierarchy.</p>

                <p>Behaving as desired requires selecting the appropriate behavior and inhibiting the selection of inappropriate behavior. This inhibitory function involves multiple processes, such as reactive and proactive inhibition, instead of a single process. In this study, two male macaque monkeys were required to perform a task in which they had to sequentially select (accept) or refuse (reject) a choice. Neural activity was recorded from the anterior striatum, which is considered to be involved in behavioral inhibition, focusing on the distinction between proactive and reactive inhibitions. We identified neurons with significant activity changes during the rejection of bad objects. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct groups, of which only one showed increased activity during object rejection, suggesting its involvement in proactive inhibition. This activity pattern was consistent irrespective of the rejection method, indicating a role beyond saccadic suppression. Furthermore, minimal activity changes during the fixation task indicated that these neurons were not primarily involved in reactive inhibition. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the anterior striatum plays a crucial role in cognitive control and orchestrates goal-directed behavior through proactive inhibition, which may be critical in understanding the mechanisms of behavioral inhibition dysfunction that occur in patients with basal ganglia disease.</p>

                <p>There is mounting evidence that the cerebellum impacts hippocampal functioning, but the impact of the cerebellum on hippocampal interneurons remains obscure. Using miniscopes in<I> </I>freely behaving male and female mice, we found optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells alters the calcium activity of a large percentage of CA1 interneurons. This includes both increases and decreases in activity. Remarkably, this bidirectional impact occurs in a coordinated fashion, in line with interneurons&rsquo; functional properties. Specifically, CA1 interneurons activated by cerebellar stimulation are commonly locomotion-active, while those inhibited by cerebellar stimulation are commonly rest-active interneurons. We additionally found that subsets of CA1 interneurons show altered activity during object investigations. Importantly, these interneurons also show coordinated modulation by cerebellar stimulation: CA1 interneurons that are activated by cerebellar stimulation are more likely to be activated, rather than inhibited, during object investigations, while interneurons that show decreased activity during cerebellar stimulation show the opposite profile. We examined two different stimulation locations (IV/V vermis or simplex) and two different stimulation approaches (7&nbsp;Hz or a single 1&nbsp;s light pulse)&mdash;in all cases, the cerebellum induces similar coordinated CA1 interneuron changes congruent with an explorative state. Overall, our data show that CA1 interneurons are impacted by cerebellar manipulation in a bidirectional and coordinated fashion and are therefore likely to play an important role in cerebello&ndash;hippocampal communication.</p>

                <p>Animal vocalizations and human speech are typically characterized by a complex spectrotemporal structure, composed of multiple harmonics, and patterned as temporally organized sequences. However, auditory research often employed simple artificial acoustic stimuli or their combinations. Here we addressed the question of whether the neuronal responses to natural echolocation call sequences can be predicted by manipulated sequences of incomplete constituents at the midbrain inferior colliculus (IC). We characterized the extracellular single-unit activity of IC neurons in the great roundleaf bat, <I>Hipposideros armiger</I> (both sexes), using natural call sequences, various manipulated sequences of incomplete vocalizations, and pure tones. We report that approximately two-thirds of IC neurons exhibited a harmonic interaction. Neurons with high harmonic interactions exhibited greater selectivity to natural call sequences, and the degree of harmonic interaction was robust to the natural amplitude variations between call harmonics. For 81% of the IC neurons, the responses to the natural echolocation call sequence could not be predicted by altered sequences of missing call components. Surprisingly, nearly 70% of the neurons that showed a harmonic interaction were characterized by a single excitatory response peak as revealed by pure tones. Our results suggest that prevalent harmonic processing has already emerged in the auditory midbrain IC in the echolocating bat.</p>

                <p>Mutations in SYNGAP1, a protein enriched at glutamatergic synapses, cause intellectual disability associated with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and sensory dysfunctions. Several studies showed that Syngap1 regulates the time course of forebrain glutamatergic synapse maturation; however, the developmental role of Syngap1 in inhibitory GABAergic neurons is less clear. GABAergic neurons can be classified into different subtypes based on their morphology, connectivity, and physiological properties. Whether <I>Syngap1</I> expression specifically in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing and somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons, which are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), plays a role in the emergence of distinct brain functions remains largely unknown. We used genetic strategies to generate <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency in (1) prenatal interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence, (2) in postnatal PV cells, and (3) in prenatal SST interneurons. We further performed in vivo recordings and behavioral assays to test whether and how these different genetic manipulations alter brain function and behavior in mice of either sex. Mice with prenatal-onset <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency restricted to Nkx2.1-expressing neurons show abnormal cortical oscillations and increased entrainment induced by 40&nbsp;Hz auditory stimulation but lack stimulus-specific adaptation. This latter phenotype was reproduced in mice with <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency restricted to PV, but not SST, interneurons. Prenatal-onset <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency in Nkx2.1-expressing neurons led to impaired social behavior and inability to extinguish fear memories; however, neither postnatal PV- nor prenatal SST-specific mutant mice show these phenotypes. We speculate that <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency in prenatal/perinatal PV interneurons may contribute to cortical activity and cognitive alterations associated with <I>Syngap1</I> mutations.</p>

                <p>In a real-world environment, the brain must integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, including the auditory and olfactory systems. However, little is known about the neuronal circuits governing how odors influence and modulate sound processing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying auditory&ndash;olfactory integration using anatomical, electrophysiological, and optogenetic approaches, focusing on the auditory cortex as a key locus for cross-modal integration. First, retrograde and anterograde viral tracing strategies revealed a direct projection from the piriform cortex to the auditory cortex. Next, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex of awake male or female mice, we found that odors modulate auditory cortical responses to sound. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic manipulations during electrophysiology to demonstrate that olfactory modulation in the auditory cortex, specifically, odor-driven enhancement of sound responses, depends on direct input from the piriform cortex. Together, our results identify a novel role of piriform-to-auditory cortical circuitry in shaping olfactory modulation in the auditory cortex, shedding new light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying auditory&ndash;olfactory integration.</p>

                <p>Single-photon optogenetics enables precise, cell-type&ndash;specific modulation of neuronal circuits, making it a crucial tool in neuroscience. Its miniaturization in the form of fully implantable wide-field stimulator arrays enables long-term interrogation of cortical circuits and bears promise for brain&ndash;machine interfaces for sensory and motor function restoration. However, achieving selective activation of functional cortical representations poses a challenge, as studies show that targeted optogenetic stimulation results in activity spread beyond one functional domain. While recurrent network mechanisms contribute to activity spread, here we demonstrate with detailed simulations of isolated pyramidal neurons from cats of unknown sex that already neuron morphology causes a complex spread of optogenetic activity at the scale of one cortical column. Since the shape of a neuron impacts its optogenetic response, we find that a single stimulator at the cortical surface recruits a complex spatial distribution of neurons that can be inhomogeneous and vary with stimulation intensity and neuronal morphology across layers. We explore strategies to enhance stimulation precision, finding that optimizing stimulator optics may offer more significant improvements than the preferentially somatic expression of the opsin through genetic targeting. Our results indicate that, with the right optical setup, single-photon optogenetics can precisely activate isolated neurons at the scale of functional cortical domains spanning several hundred micrometers.</p>

                <p>The cortex immediately surrounding a brain ischemic lesion, the peri-infarct cortex (PIC), harbors a large part of the potential to recover lost functions. However, our understanding of the neurophysiological conditions in which synaptic plasticity operates remains limited. Here we hypothesized that the chronic imbalance between excitation and inhibition of the PIC prevents the normalization of the gamma rhythm, a waveband of neural oscillations thought to orchestrate action potential trafficking. Probing the local field potential activity of the forelimb primary sensory cortex (S1FL) located in the PIC of male adult mice, we found a constant, deep reduction of low-gamma oscillation power (L-gamma; 30&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz) precisely during the critical time window for recovery (1&ndash;3&nbsp;weeks after stroke). The collapse of L-gamma power negatively correlated with behavioral progress in affected forelimb use. Mapping astrocyte reactivity and GABA-like immunoreactivity in the PIC revealed a parallel high signal, which gradually increased when approaching the lesion. Increasing tonic inhibition with local infusion of GABA or by blocking its recapture reduced L-gamma oscillation power in a magnitude similar to stroke. Conversely, the negative allosteric modulation of tonic GABA conductance using L655,708 or the gliopeptide ODN rescued the L-gamma power of the PIC. Altogether the present data point out that the chronic excess of ambient GABA in the PIC limits the generation of L-gamma oscillations in the repairing cortex and suggests that rehabilitative interventions aimed at normalizing low-gamma power within the critical period of stroke recovery could optimize the restitution of lost functions.</p>

                In the anterior area of the mouth, the interdental papilla is important for dental hygiene and appearance. When it disappears, unpleasant “black triangles” form, which affects patients’ self-confidence in their smiles and makes oral hygiene more difficult. The loss of interdental papilla is caused by several variables such as tooth shape, periodontal disease, and aging. Although surgical treatments have been utilized to restore or retain missing papilla, their predictability remains unknown. In response, researchers have investigated non-invasive procedures, such as the use of fillers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Owing to its capacity to increase tissue volume and bind water, HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide with special rheological qualities, has become a popular choice for use as a dermal filler. It shows promise when used to cure interdental papilla loss; the effects usually last for six–12 months. This review article explores the development and history of papilla rebuilding methods, emphasizing hyaluronic acid as a cutting-edge and successful method for regaining both periodontal health and aesthetics.

                Abstract* Background This study examines the influence of auxiliary lighting configurations and artificial surface textures on the quality of 3D models generated using Structure from Motion (SfM) in an indoor laboratory setting. Method Experiments were conducted by capturing images of concrete, metal, and wooden specimens at a one-meter distance. Various lighting setups, including vertical and adjacent auxiliary lighting models, were tested to determine their impact on model accuracy. In addition, complex artificial textures, such as checkerboard patterns, were applied to the specimens to assess their effect on 3D model precision. Results Our results demonstrate that optimal lighting and artificial textures significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D models, especially for materials with uniform textures, such as painted metal. For materials with more varied textures, such as concrete and wood, improvements were notable but less pronounced. The combination of auxiliary lighting and artificial textures improved model quality by approximately 40% for high-texture materials and up to 60% for uniform-texture materials. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of image file formats in the SfM process. While RAW images stored in TIFF format offered a slight advantage over lossless JPEG in terms of model accuracy, the difference may not be substantial enough to justify the larger file size in situations where submillimeter precision is not required. Conclusions Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of tailored lighting and texturing strategies for achieving high-precision 3D models in SfM applications. These results are particularly relevant for structural testing and other applications that demand high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, providing a foundation for more accurate and reliable models.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Lack of blood supply to the brain can cause tissue death if any of the cerebral veins, carotid arteries, or vertebral arteries are blocked. An ischemic stroke describes this type of event. One of the byproducts of methionine metabolism, the demethylation of methionine, is homocysteine, an amino acid that contains sulfur. During myocardial ischemia, the plasma level of homocysteine (Hcy) increases and plays a role in many methylation processes. Hyperhomocysteinemia has only recently been recognized as a major contributor to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) owing to its effects on atherothrombosis and improvement of oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction, joining the ranks of other known risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and advanced age. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between elevated serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in an Iraqi population of patients with ischemic heart disease. Methods This study was conducted at Madinat al-Imamain Al Kadhmain Hospital’s Cardiology Department in Baghdad, Iraq. The study lasted for six months and was designed as an observational case-control study from November 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024. Results Cases and controls had similar characteristics but differed significantly in serum homocysteine concentration. The mean homocysteine level in case group was 40.21±14.47 mmol/L and 9.23±2.41 mmol/L in control group with p value <0.001. Conclusion In young individuals, hyperhomocysteinemia is positively associated with coronary artery, even when other traditional risk factors are not present.

                <p>by Niloufar Abhari, Caroline Colijn, Arne Mooers, Paul Tupper</p>

Diversity plays an important role in various domains, including conservation, whether it describes diversity within a population or diversity over a set of species. While various strategies for measuring among-species diversity have emerged (e.g. Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), Split System Diversity (SSD) and entropy-based methods), extensions to populations are rare. An understudied problem is how to assess the diversity of a collection of populations where each has its own internal diversity. Relying solely on measures that treat each population as a monomorphic lineage (like a species) can be misleading. To address this problem, we present four population-level diversity assessment approaches: Pooling, Averaging, Pairwise Differencing, and Fixing. These approaches can be used to extend any diversity measure that is primarily defined for a group of individuals to a collection of populations. We then apply the approaches to two measures of diversity that have been used in conservation—Heterozygosity (Het) and Split System Diversity (SSD)—across a dataset comprising SNP data for 50 anadromous Atlantic salmon populations. We investigate agreement and disagreement between these measures of diversity when used to identify optimal sets of populations for conservation, on both the observed data, and randomized and simulated datasets. The similarity and differences of the maximum-diversity sets as well as the pairwise correlations among our proposed measures emphasize the need to clearly define what aspects of biodiversity we aim to both measure and optimize, to ensure meaningful and effective conservation decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012631">A regression based approach to phylogenetic reconstruction from multi-sample bulk DNA sequencing of tumors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Henri Schmidt, Benjamin J. Raphael</p>
Motivation <p>DNA sequencing of multiple bulk samples from a tumor provides the opportunity to investigate tumor heterogeneity and reconstruct a phylogeny of a patient’s cancer. However, since bulk DNA sequencing of tumor tissue measures thousands of cells from a heterogeneous mixture of distinct sub-populations, accurate reconstruction of the tumor phylogeny requires simultaneous deconvolution of cancer clones and inference of ancestral relationships, leading to a challenging computational problem. Many existing methods for phylogenetic reconstruction from bulk sequencing data do not scale to large datasets, such as recent datasets containing upwards of ninety samples with dozens of distinct sub-populations.</p> Results <p>We develop an approach to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from multi-sample bulk DNA sequencing data by separating the reconstruction problem into two parts: a structured regression problem for a fixed tree T, and an optimization over tree space. We derive an algorithm for the regression sub-problem by exploiting the unique, combinatorial structure of the matrices appearing within the problem. This algorithm has both asymptotic and empirical improvements over linear programming (LP) approaches to the problem. Using our algorithm for this regression sub-problem, we develop <i>fastBE</i>, a simple method for phylogenetic inference from multi-sample bulk DNA sequencing data. We demonstrate on simulated data with hundreds of samples and upwards of a thousand distinct sub-populations that <i>fastBE</i> outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sample efficiency, and runtime. Owing to its scalability, <i>fastBE</i> enables both phylogenetic reconstruction directly from indvidual mutations without requiring the clustering of mutations into clones, as well as a new phylogeny constrained mutation clustering algorithm. On real data from fourteen B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, <i>fastBE</i> infers mutation phylogenies with fewer violations of a widely used evolutionary constraint and better agreement to the observed mutational frequencies. Using our phylogeny constrained mutation clustering algorithm, we also find mutation clusters with lower distortion compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we show that on two patient-derived colorectal cancer models, <i>fastBE</i> infers mutation phylogenies with less violation of a widely used evolutionary constraint compared to existing methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614">Predicting proprioceptive cortical anatomy and neural coding with topographic autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Max Grogan, Kyle P. Blum, Yufei Wu, J. Alex Harston, Lee E. Miller, A. Aldo Faisal</p>

Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002935">Local changes in potassium ions regulate input integration in active dendrites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Malthe S. Nordentoft, Naoya Takahashi, Mathias S. Heltberg, Mogens H. Jensen, Rune N. Rasmussen, Athanasia Papoutsi</p>

During neuronal activity, the extracellular concentration of potassium ions ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) increases substantially above resting levels, yet it remains unclear what role these [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> changes play in the dendritic integration of synaptic inputs. We here used mathematical formulations and biophysical modeling to explore the role of synaptic activity-dependent K<sup>+</sup> changes in dendritic segments of a visual cortex pyramidal neuron, receiving inputs tuned to stimulus orientation. We found that the spatial arrangement of inputs dictates the magnitude of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> changes in the dendrites: Dendritic segments receiving similarly tuned inputs can attain substantially higher [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increases than segments receiving diversely tuned inputs. These [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> elevations in turn increase dendritic excitability, leading to more robust and prolonged dendritic spikes. Ultimately, these local effects amplify the gain of neuronal input–output transformations, causing higher orientation-tuned somatic firing rates without compromising orientation selectivity. Our results suggest that local, activity-dependent [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> changes in dendrites may act as a “volume knob” that determines the impact of synaptic inputs on feature-tuned neuronal firing.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) receives visceral information and regulates appetitive, digestive, and cardiorespiratory systems. Within the NTS, diverse processes operate in parallel to sustain life, but our understanding of their cellular composition is incomplete. Here, we integrate histologic and transcriptomic analysis to identify and compare molecular features that distinguish neurons in this brain region. Most glutamatergic neurons in the NTS and area postrema co-express the transcription factors <i>Lmx1b</i> and <i>Phox2b</i>, except for a ventral band of neurons in the far-caudal NTS, which include the <i>Gcg</i>-expressing neurons that produce glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GABAergic interneurons intermingle through the <i>Lmx1b</i>+<i>Phox2b</i> macropopulation, and dense clusters of GABAergic neurons surround the NTS. The <i>Lmx1b</i>+<i>Phox2b</i> macropopulation includes subpopulations with distinct distributions expressing <i>Grp</i>, <i>Hsd11b2, Npff</i>, <i>Pdyn</i>, <i>Pou3f1</i>, <i>Sctr</i>, <i>Th</i>, and other markers. These findings highlight <i>Lmx1b</i>–<i>Phox2b</i> co-expression as a common feature of glutamatergic neurons in the NTS and improve our understanding of the organization and distribution of neurons in this critical brain region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1476/v1?src=rss">Fuzzy Pseudo-ideal in  Pseudo-TM  Alegbra [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Fuzzy sets and ideals play a significant role in the study of algebraic structures, particularly in the context of pseudo-TM algebras, which are non-commutative generalizations of MV-algebras. However, the concept of fuzzy pseudo-ideals within these algebras has not been extensively explored. This paper introduces fuzzy pseudo-ideals in pseudo-TM algebras and investigates their key properties, contributing to the broader understanding of fuzzy algebraic structures. Methods We define fuzzy pseudo-ideals in the framework of pseudo-TM algebras and investigate their properties using level sets. The paper employs techniques from algebraic logic and set theory to characterize fuzzy pseudo-ideals and their interactions with homomorphism’s and Cartesian products. Several theorems are developed to establish the closure of fuzzy pseudo-ideals under intersection, and their relationships with homomorphism’s and Cartesian products are explored. Results The main findings include a comprehensive characterization of fuzzy pseudo-ideals in pseudo-TM algebras, both in terms of their algebraic structure and their behavior under intersections. We also show how these fuzzy pseudo-ideals interact with homomorphism’s and Cartesian products. Concrete examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results, demonstrating the applicability of the concepts to real-world algebraic problems. Conclusions This research enhances the theoretical understanding of fuzzy sets and ideals within pseudo-TM algebras, offering new insights into their properties and interrelationships. The results pave the way for future work, particularly in extending the concepts to fuzzy pseudo-strong ideals and fuzzy pseudo-TM ideals. These extensions could further advance the study of fuzzy algebraic structures, contributing to the broader field of algebraic logic and fuzzy set theory.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1350/v2?src=rss">A Validated Trigonelline-Based Method for the Standardization and Quality Control of Trigonella foenum-graecum L. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds are rich in proteins, lipids, and essential nutrients, and they also contain various phytochemicals, including flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids such as trigonelline. Trigonelline (TG) is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the critical need for a fast, green, and economical method that overcomes inefficiencies, high solvent usage, and sensitivity limitations in the quantification of TG. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield was 5.36 mg/100 mg with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLC-MS/MS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4 ppb (SD = 176.4), with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (mean = 392.7, SD = 132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (mean = 91.9, SD = 83.3 ppb) and ACt (mean = 59.5, SD = 30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

                Carling et al. report that late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk alleles drive cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, in a tau- and sex-dependent manner. Mechanistic insights into interactions among genetic risk, biological aging, and sex differences in LOAD are presented.

                John Hopfield’s model on collective computation linked the recall of memories with interactions and dynamics associated with disordered magnetic systems. Insights from Hopfield’s work catalyzed formulations that link the dynamics and emergent properties of recurrently connected generic neurons with the functional properties and signaling observed from brain circuits.

                Lopes-Bastos et al. report that melanoma in zebrafish initiates without telomerase (or ALT) activation. However, in late progression, telomerase becomes essential for sustained tumor growth. Tumors that fail to re-activate telomerase slow down growth and even regress. This occurs due to tumor-autonomous (genomic instability) and non-tumor-autonomous (immune response) mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91980">Role of the αC-β4 loop in protein kinase structure and dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Although the αC-β4 loop is a stable feature of all protein kinases, the importance of this motif as a conserved element of secondary structure, as well as its links to the hydrophobic architecture of the kinase core, has been underappreciated. We first review the motif and then describe how it is linked to the hydrophobic spine architecture of the kinase core, which we first discovered using a computational tool, local spatial Pattern (LSP) alignment. Based on NMR predictions that a mutation in this motif abolishes the synergistic high-affinity binding of ATP and a pseudo substrate inhibitor, we used LSP to interrogate the F100A mutant. This comparison highlights the importance of the αC-β4 loop and key residues at the interface between the N- and C-lobes. In addition, we delved more deeply into the structure of the apo C-subunit, which lacks ATP. While apo C-subunit showed no significant changes in backbone dynamics of the αC-β4 loop, we found significant differences in the side chain dynamics of K105. The LSP analysis suggests disruption of communication between the N- and C-lobes in the F100A mutant, which would be consistent with the structural changes predicted by the NMR spectroscopy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97184">Cortical beta oscillations map to shared brain networks modulated by dopamine</a></h4>

              
                Brain rhythms can facilitate neural communication for the maintenance of brain function. Beta rhythms (13–35 Hz) have been proposed to serve multiple domains of human ability, including motor control, cognition, memory, and emotion, but the overarching organisational principles remain unknown. To uncover the circuit architecture of beta oscillations, we leverage normative brain data, analysing over 30 hr of invasive brain signals from 1772 channels from cortical areas in epilepsy patients, to demonstrate that beta is the most distributed cortical brain rhythm. Next, we identify a shared brain network from beta-dominant areas with deeper brain structures, like the basal ganglia, by mapping parametrised oscillatory peaks to whole-brain functional and structural MRI connectomes. Finally, we show that these networks share significant overlap with dopamine uptake as indicated by positron emission tomography. Our study suggests that beta oscillations emerge in cortico-subcortical brain networks that are modulated by dopamine. It provides the foundation for a unifying circuit-based conceptualisation of the functional role of beta activity beyond the motor domain and may inspire an extended investigation of beta activity as a feedback signal for closed-loop neurotherapies for dopaminergic disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102467">An annotated introductory reading list for neurodiversity</a></h4>

              
                Since its inception, the concept of neurodiversity has been defined in a number of different ways, which can cause confusion among those hoping to educate themselves about the topic. Learning about neurodiversity can also be challenging because there is a lack of well-curated, appropriately contextualized information on the topic. To address such barriers, we present an annotated reading list that was developed collaboratively by a neurodiverse group of researchers. The nine themes covered in the reading list are: the history of neurodiversity; ways of thinking about neurodiversity; the importance of lived experience; a neurodiversity paradigm for autism science; beyond deficit views of ADHD; expanding the scope of neurodiversity; anti-ableism; the need for robust theory and methods; and integration with open and participatory work. We hope this resource can support readers in understanding some of the key ideas and topics within neurodiversity, and that it can further orient researchers towards more rigorous, destigmatizing, accessible, and inclusive scientific practices.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98148">The transformation of sensory to perceptual braille letter representations in the visually deprived brain</a></h4>

              
                Experience-based plasticity of the human cortex mediates the influence of individual experience on cognition and behavior. The complete loss of a sensory modality is among the most extreme such experiences. Investigating such a selective, yet extreme change in experience allows for the characterization of experience-based plasticity at its boundaries. Here, we investigated information processing in individuals who lost vision at birth or early in life by probing the processing of braille letter information. We characterized the transformation of braille letter information from sensory representations depending on the reading hand to perceptual representations that are independent of the reading hand. Using a multivariate analysis framework in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioral assessment, we tracked cortical braille representations in space and time, and probed their behavioral relevance. We located sensory representations in tactile processing areas and perceptual representations in sighted reading areas, with the lateral occipital complex as a connecting ‘hinge’ region. This elucidates the plasticity of the visually deprived brain in terms of information processing. Regarding information processing in time, we found that sensory representations emerge before perceptual representations. This indicates that even extreme cases of brain plasticity adhere to a common temporal scheme in the progression from sensory to perceptual transformations. Ascertaining behavioral relevance through perceived similarity ratings, we found that perceptual representations in sighted reading areas, but not sensory representations in tactile processing areas are suitably formatted to guide behavior. Together, our results reveal a nuanced picture of both the potentials and limits of experience-dependent plasticity in the visually deprived brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96933">Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rev7 promotes non-homologous end-joining by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities and homologous recombination</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that, in human cancer cells, the tetrameric Shieldin complex (comprising REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3) facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) while blocking homologous recombination (HR). Surprisingly, several eukaryotic species lack SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3 orthologs, suggesting that Rev7 may leverage an alternative mechanism to regulate the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Exploring this hypothesis, we discovered that <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Rev7 physically interacts with the Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) subunits, impedes G-quadruplex DNA synergized HU-induced toxicity, and facilitates NHEJ, while antagonizing HR. Notably, we reveal that a 42-amino acid C-terminal fragment of Rev7 binds to the subunits of MRX complex, protects <i>rev7∆</i> cells from G-quadruplex DNA-HU-induced toxicity, and promotes NHEJ by blocking HR. By comparison, the N-terminal HORMA domain, a conserved protein–protein interaction module, was dispensable. We further show that the full-length Rev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities without affecting the latter’s ATP-binding ability. Combined, these results provide unanticipated insights into the functional interaction between the MRX subunits and Rev7 and highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Rev7 facilitates DSB repair via NHEJ, and attenuation of HR, by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98531">PDGFRα signaling regulates Srsf3 transcript binding to affect PI3K signaling and endosomal trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Signaling through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) plays a critical role in craniofacial development. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt is the primary effector of PDGFRα signaling during mouse skeletal development. We previously demonstrated that Akt phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3) downstream of PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells, leading to its nuclear translocation. We further showed that ablation of <i>Srsf3</i> in the murine neural crest lineage results in severe midline facial clefting and widespread alternative RNA splicing (AS) changes. Here, we demonstrated via enhanced UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of MEPM cells that PDGF-AA stimulation leads to preferential binding of Srsf3 to exons and loss of binding to canonical Srsf3 CA-rich motifs. Through the analysis of complementary RNA-seq data, we showed that Srsf3 activity results in the preferential inclusion of exons with increased GC content and lower intron to exon length ratio. We found that Srsf3 activity downstream of PDGFRα signaling leads to retention of the receptor in early endosomes and increases in downstream PI3K-mediated Akt signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal that growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of an RNA-binding protein underlies gene expression regulation necessary for mammalian craniofacial development.

                As the early step of food ingestion, the swallow is under rigorous sensorimotor control. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying swallow control at a molecular and circuitry level remain largely unknown. Here, we find that mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes <i>nompC</i>, <i>Tmc,</i> or <i>piezo</i> impairs the regular pumping rhythm of the cibarium during feeding of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. A group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons, which co-express the three channels, wrap the cibarium and are crucial for coordinating the filling and emptying of the cibarium. Inhibition of them causes difficulty in food emptying in the cibarium, while their activation leads to difficulty in cibarium filling. Synaptic and functional connections are detected between the pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons and the motor circuit that controls swallow. This study elucidates the role of mechanosensation in swallow, and provides insights for a better understanding of the neural basis of food swallow.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98056">Habitat fragmentation mediates the mechanisms underlying long-term climate-driven thermophilization in birds</a></h4>

              
                Climatic warming can shift community composition driven by the colonization-extinction dynamics of species with different thermal preferences; but simultaneously, habitat fragmentation can mediate species’ responses to warming. As this potential interactive effect has proven difficult to test empirically, we collected data on birds over 10 years of climate warming in a reservoir subtropical island system that was formed 65 years ago. We investigated how the mechanisms underlying climate-driven directional change in community composition were mediated by habitat fragmentation. We found thermophilization driven by increasing warm-adapted species and decreasing cold-adapted species in terms of trends in colonization rate, extinction rate, occupancy rate and population size. Critically, colonization rates of warm-adapted species increased faster temporally on smaller or less isolated islands; cold-adapted species generally were lost more quickly temporally on closer islands. This provides support for dispersal limitation and microclimate buffering as primary proxies by which habitat fragmentation mediates species range shift. Overall, this study advances our understanding of biodiversity responses to interacting global change drivers.

Here we performed simultaneous in vivo local-field potential and multi-unit recordings under light urethane anaesthesia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) of male and female juvenile or adolescent mice, exposed to a resource scarcity model of ELS. We find a developmentally transient low-theta (3-5 Hz) oscillatory hypercoupling within mPFC-BLA networks in juvenile ELS males which seems to result from a precocious development of coupling strength after ELS. In the mPFC, neuronal spiking activity was decreased in juvenile males and the local theta entrainment of spike firing disrupted. In BLA, both sexes showed an increase in firing activity in a subpopulation of neurons after ELS, also confirmed by an increase in deltaFosB-positive neurons in BLA, which we identified to be non-GABAergic. Directed interactions, i.e. the ability to entrain spike firing in mPFC to the theta rhythm in BLA and vice versa, were also impaired predominantly in juvenile males after ELS, while females showed a milder phenotype. These early sex-dependent impairments in the functional development of prefrontal-amygdala circuits may promote abnormal fear learning and anxiety after ELS and may predispose to a disease phenotype later on.

">Microglial cathepsin B promotes neuronal efferocytosis during brain development</a></h4>

              
                Half of all newborn neurons in the developing brain are removed via efferocytosis - the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells. Microglia are brain-resident professional phagocytes that play important roles in neural circuit development including as primary effectors of efferocytosis. While the mechanisms through which microglia recognize potential phagocytic cargo are widely studied, the lysosomal mechanisms that are necessary for efficient digestion are less well defined. Here we show that the lysosomal protease cathepsin B promotes microglial efferocytosis of neurons and restricts the accumulation of apoptotic cells during brain development. We show that cathepsin B is microglia-specific and enriched in brain regions where neuronal turnover is high in both zebrafish and mouse. Myeloid-specific cathepsin B knockdown in zebrafish led to dysmorphic microglia containing undigested dead cells, as well as an accumulation of dead cells in surrounding tissue. These effects where phenocopied in mice globally deficient for Ctsb using markers for apoptosis. We also observed behavioral impairments in both models. Live imaging studies in zebrafish revealed deficits in phagolysosomal fusion and acidification, and live imaging of cultured mouse microglia reveal delayed phagocytosis consistent with impairments in digestion and resolution of phagocytosis rather than initial uptake. These data reveal a novel role for microglial cathepsin B in mediating neuronal efferocytosis during typical brain development.

">Cholinergic interneurons of the dorsomedial striatum mediate winner-loser effects on social hierarchy dynamics in male mice.</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic interneurons of the dorsomedial striatum may play a role in social hierarchy dynamics. A social hierarchy is an organization of individuals by rank that occurs in social animals. Establishing a new social hierarchy involves flexible behavior in deciding whether to be a winner or loser, experience of winning or losing, and stabilization of rank. The neural circuits underlying such flexible behavior have yet to be fully understood, but previous research indicates that cholinergic interneurons in the dorsomedial striatum play a role in behavioral flexibility. We used the dominance tube test to measure ranking within group housed mice, before and after between-cage competitions using the same test. We found that the experience of winning or losing against mice from different cages not only contributes to new social hierarchies among the competitors, but also causally influences the subsequent social hierarchy among their cage mates in the home cage - supporting the hypothesis of winner-loser effects on later social ranking. To test the hypothesis that cholinergic interneurons contribute to social hierarchy dynamics, we made a selective lesion of cholinergic interneurons in the dorsomedial striatum. The lesion did not prevent social hierarchy formation among pairs of similarly ranked individuals from different cages. However, it reduced the loser effect of external competition on the subsequent home-cage rankings in dominant mice. In light of these results we suggest that cholinergic interneurons in dorsomedial striatum increase the flexibility of social hierarchy dynamics.

">Narcissistic and Antisocial Personality Traits are both encoded in the Triple Network: Connectomics evidence</a></h4>

              
                The neural bases of narcissistic and antisocial traits are still under debate. One intriguing question is whether these traits are encoded within the so-called triple network e.g. the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and fronto-parietal (FPN) networks, and whether these traits affect the same networks in a similar manner. Connectome-based analyses were conducted on resting-state scans from 183 participants, examining regional and global graph-theoretic metrics in the DMN, SN, and FPN, with the visual and sensorimotor networks as controls. Our findings revealed a clear involvement of the triple network in narcissistic and antisocial traits, confirming a shared neural substrate for the two traits. Both traits were negatively predicted by the anterior cingulate cortex of the SN, possibly indicating less awareness of dangers and more proneness to engage in risky behaviors. Additionally, both traits were positively predicted by the lateral prefrontal cortex of the FPN, suggesting augmented strategic thinking to manipulate others and increased planning skills to achieve personal goals. Besides similarities, there were also some differences. Specific hubs of the DMN were positively associated with narcissism but negatively related with antisocials, possibly explaining their differences in self-reflection and thinking about the self, largely present in the former, but usually reduced in the latter. These results extend previous findings on the involvement of the triple network in personality disorders and suggest both common and different mechanisms underlying narcissistic and antisocial traits. As such, these findings could pave the way for developing potential biomarkers of personality pathology and identify neurostimulation intervention targets.

">Revealing rhythm categorization in human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Humans across cultures show an outstanding capacity to perceive, learn, and produce musical rhythms. These skills rely on mapping the infinite space of possible rhythmic sensory inputs onto a finite set of internal rhythm categories. What are the brain processes underlying rhythm categorization? We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two inter-onset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs, but, instead, automatically produces categorical representation of rhythms. Surprisingly, despite this automaticity, these rhythm categories do not arise in the earliest stages of the ascending auditory pathway, but show strong similarity between implicit neural and overt behavioral responses. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step towards understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures.

                Medial ganglionic eminence-derived inhibitory GABAergic pallial interneurons (MGE-pINs) are essential regulators of cortical circuits; their dysfunction is associated with numerous neurological disorders. We developed human (h) MGE-pINs from pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Here, we analyzed xenografted hMGE-pINs over the lifespan of host mice using single nuclei RNA sequencing. Comparative transcriptomics against endogenous human brain datasets revealed that 97% of grafted cells developed into somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) subtypes, including populations that exhibit selective vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease. Transplanted hMGE-pINs demonstrated rapid emergence of subclass features, progressing through distinct transcriptional states sequentially involving neuronal migration, synapse organization, and membrane maturation. We present molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological data that collectively confirm the derivation of diverse bona-fide human SST and PVALB subtypes, providing a high-fidelity model to study human MGE-pIN development and functional maturation as well as a compositional atlas for regenerative cell therapy applications.

">Oral supplementation with Nicotinamide Riboside treatment protects RGCs in DBA/2J mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The aim of this study was to test whether oral administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR), the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursors, protect retina ganglion cells (RGCs) from neurodegeneration in DBA/2J (D2) mice, which is a widely used mouse model of age-related inherited glaucoma. Method: Oral NR or NAM administration (NR low dose: 1150mg/kg; NR high dose: 4200mg/kg; NAM low dose group: 500mg/kg; NAM high dose: 2000mg/kg of body weight per day) essentially started when D2 mice were 4 or 9 months old and continued up to 12 months old. Control cohort identically received food/water without NAM or NR. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured every month until experiment completion. Pattern electroretinography (PERG) was recorded. Retinas were harvested for whole mount immunofluorescence staining with RGCs marker Brn3a and imaged by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Optic nerves were harvested for axon staining and quantification. Retinal NAD+ levels were enzymatically assayed. Results: NR oral supplementary treatment started at 4 months old robustly increased retinal NAD+ levels in D2 mice (NRHigh vs. vehicle: 273.7{+/-}23.59% vs. 108.70{+/-}12.10%, p<0.001). In aged vehicle group (12 months old), there was significantly diminution of the P1 and N2 components of PERG response compare with na&iumlve group (na&iumlve vs. vehicle: P1: 7.82{+/-} 0.70uV vs 1.63{+/-} 0.17uV, p<0.0001; N2: -13.29{+/-} 0.83uV 2 vs. -3.22{+/-} 0.27uV, p<0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test). NR treatment preserved aged D2 visual function when mice were 9 and 12 months old. In addition, long-term NR high dose treatment significantly protected against total RGCs loss and optic nerve atrophy (RGC: NRHigh vs. vehicle: 1412{+/-}62.00vs 475.2{+/-}94.68 cells/field, p<0.00001; axon numbers: NRHigh vs. vehicle: 23990{+/-}1159 vs 8573{+/-}1160, n=41-53, p<0.0001). Furthermore, long-term NR supplementation prevent iris depigmentation and delayed IOP elevation. Conclusion: NR oral supplementary treatment significantly preserved RGC and axon numbers, potentially preserves retinal function via elevated retinal NAD+ level in aged D2 mice. Interestingly, NR treatment also prevented iris atrophy, delayed IOP elevation associated with this glaucoma model. NR oral supplementation thus treated several aspects of murine pigment dispersion glaucoma. Given parallels between this model and glaucoma in human, out data indicate that NR is worth exploring as a therapeutic candidate in treatment of glaucoma.

">Cortical dynamics in hand/forelimb S1 and M1 evoked by brief photostimulation of the mouses hand</a></h4>

              
                Spiking activity along synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (Yamawaki et al., 2021). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas in the same system. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short (~25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Response amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated to approximately a third of those in S1. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three-quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. These results provide quantitative measures of spiking dynamics of cortical activity along the hand/forelimb-related transcortical loop; demonstrate a prominent and mechanistic role for PV neurons in each phase of the response; and, support a conceptual model in which somatosensory signals reach S1 via high-speed subcortical circuits to generate characteristic barrages of cortical activity, then reach M1 via densely polysynaptic corticocortical circuits to generate a similar but delayed and attenuated profile of activity.

">Individual differences in probabilistic learning and updating predictive representations in individuals with obsessive-compulsive tendencies</a></h4>

              
                Obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies involve intrusive thoughts and rigid, repetitive behaviours that also manifest at the subclinical level in the general population. The neurocognitive factors driving the development and persistence of the excessive presence of these tendencies remain highly elusive, though emerging theories emphasize the role of implicit information processing. Despite various empirical studies on distinct neurocognitive processes, the incidental retrieval of environmental structures in dynamic and noisy environments, such as probabilistic learning, has received relatively little attention. In this study, we aimed to unravel potential individual differences in implicit probabilistic learning and the updating of predictive representations related to OC tendencies in the general population. We conducted two independent online experiments (NStudy1 = 164, NStudy2 = 257) with young adults. Probabilistic learning was assessed using a reliable implicit visuomotor probabilistic learning task, which involved sequences with second-order non-adjacent dependencies. Our findings revealed that even among individuals displaying a broad spectrum of OC tendencies within a non-clinical population, implicit probabilistic learning remained remarkably robust. Furthermore, the results highlighted effective updating capabilities of predictive representations, which were not influenced by OC tendencies. These results offer new insights into individual differences in probabilistic learning and updating in relation to OC tendencies, contributing to theoretical, methodological, and practical approaches for understanding the maladaptive behavioural manifestations of OC disorder and subclinical tendencies.

">Temporal Configuration as a New Feature of Sound: Psychological and Neurophysiological Evidence, Cross-species Consistency and Underlying Neuronal Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Temporal integration is crucial for auditory perception, yet the mechanisms underlying its role are not fully elucidated. This study examines the perceptual discrimination of click trains with varied temporal configurations to determine if they can be perceived as distinct auditory objects, potentially introducing a novel dimension to sound perception. In humans, psychological experiments using a delayed match-to-sample task revealed that participants could distinctly discriminate between click trains with different temporal configurations, suggesting that temporal configuration significantly influences auditory perception. This was supported by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings showing robust mismatch negativity (MMN) signals, indicating that the auditory system differentiates standard from deviant sounds based on their temporal characteristics. Parallel electrocorticography (ECoG) studies in rats demonstrated similar discriminatory abilities, suggesting a cross-species consistency. Neuronal recordings showed pronounced stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) in the primary auditory cortex (A1) but minimal SSA in lower auditory areas such as the inferior colliculus (IC) and medial geniculate body (MGB), indicating that A1 uniquely integrates temporal features and discriminates complex temporal patterns. This research advances our understanding of how temporal configurations are processed in the auditory system and suggests a new feature of sound perception.

">An investigation of the effects of α and β-frequency neural entrainment using tACS on phase-aligned TMS-evoked corticospinal excitability</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation [DBS] is an effective treatment for many brain disorders, has a favourable adverse effect profile, and can be particularly effective for individuals with treatment resistant symptoms. DBS is, however, inaccessible for most individuals, is extremely expensive, and is not considered suitable for children and adolescents. For these reasons, non-invasive alternatives to DBS, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS], are increasingly being sought to treat brain health conditions. Unfortunately, current TMS approaches exhibit large intra- and inter-subject variability in their efficacy, which limits their use clinically. One likely reason for this is that TMS is invariably delivered without reference to ongoing brain activity (i.e., open loop). We propose that the efficacy of stimulation might be improved, and the variability of its effects reduced, if stimulation could be synchronised with ongoing brain activity. To investigate this, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to induce entrainment of brain activity at two frequencies (=10 Hz and {beta}=20 Hz), and we delivered single pulse TMS that was temporally aligned with the phase of each tACS oscillation. To investigate the effects of tACS-phase-aligned TMS we measured motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Our findings confirm that for -tACS and {beta}-tACS both corticospinal excitability and inter-trial variability varied as a function of tACS phase. Importantly, however, the tACS phase angle that produced maximum TMS-evoked excitability was different for -tACS and {beta}-tACS; coinciding with the negative peak (trough) for -tACS and the positive peak (peak) for {beta}-tACS. These findings confirm that aligning non-invasive brain stimulation to ongoing brain activity may increase the efficacy of TMS and reduce the variability of its effects. However, our results illustrate that the optimal phase of the tACS cycle at which to deliver TMS may vary for different tACS frequencies.

">Temporal Lobe Epilepsy is dominated by Region Specific Interictal Cortical Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is typically characterized by excessive neuronal excitability, manifesting as seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the EEG. However, the dynamics of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage the aperiodic exponent of the EEG power spectrum--a marker indicative of synaptic inhibition--to investigate shifts in E/I balance during antiseizure medication (ASM) tapering in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We analyzed EEG data from 28 TLE patients and 25 controls with non-epileptic episodes (NEE) undergoing presurgical video EEG monitoring. Unexpectedly, TLE patients showed a localized increase in the aperiodic exponent in the ipsilesional temporal lobe during ASM tapering, absent in controls. This inhibition increase correlated with seizure latency and predicted seizure occurrence. Intracranial recordings from 10 TLE patients revealed higher aperiodic exponents in the lateral temporal cortex compared to the hippocampus, suggesting stronger inhibition in the lateral cortex. Notably, hippocampal IEDs triggered transient inhibitory responses in the lateral cortex, accompanied by increased high-frequency activity and disrupted hippocampus-to-lateral connectivity. These findings suggest that TLE likely involves complex inhibitory mechanisms beyond the epileptic focus in the interictal period, with neocortical inhibition potentially containing epileptic activity, and offers a new tool to map epileptic brain regions.

">The sparse driver system for in vivo single-cell labeling and manipulation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In this protocol, we introduce a sparse driver system for cell-type specific single-cell labeling and manipulation in Drosophila, enabling complete and simultaneous expression of multiple transgenes in the same cells. The system precisely controls expression probability and sparsity via mutant FRT sites with reduced recombination efficiency and tunable FLP levels adjusted by heat-shock durations. We demonstrate that this generalizable toolkit enables tunable sparsity, multi-color staining, single-cell trans-synaptic tracing, single-cell manipulation, and in vivo analysis of cell-autonomous gene function.

For details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Xu et al. 2024.

">Emotional content effects the precision of visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                ObjectivesOur working memory (WM) is susceptible to errors influenced by various sources. Recent research has illuminated the intricate relationship between emotional valence and working memory performance. This study aims to comprehensively investigate memory recall biases across different emotional categories.

MethodTo explore this relationship, we designed and implemented a delayed-reproduction facial emotion n-back task. Participants were tasked with recalling the emotional valence of target faces across various n-back conditions, selecting their responses from a continuum of 19 morphed faces ranging from sad to happy.

ResultsOur findings indicate that participants generally exhibit a negativity bias, struggling more with happy faces. Interestingly, they also perceive happy faces as less happy and sad faces as less sad, suggesting both positive and negative reappraisal in their emotional valence perception. This underscores the complex interplay between emotional valence and cognitive performance. Notably, recall of neutral images remained stable and was unaffected by preceding emotional contexts.

ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that emotional content in working memory significantly impacts errors during WM tasks, with more emotionally charged faces leading to a greater drift toward the lower valence axis. This highlights the need for further exploration of how emotional factors influence cognitive processes in working memory.

">Beyond stimulus onset: Ongoing fixations within an object do not re-evoke category representations during free-viewing.</a></h4>

              
                Human visual perception in natural conditions involves multiple fixations within single objects. While traditional studies focus on transient neural responses to initial stimuli, this study investigates how object-category representations evolve across sequential fixations on an object. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking, we analyzed fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode neural representations of faces and watches during prolonged viewing. Results revealed robust category-selective responses, including the N170 component, at stimulus onset, with sustained representations persisting throughout object presentation. Temporal signal deconvolution showed that subsequent fixations did not re-evoke the N170 but elicited transient occipital responses, likely reflecting low-level differences. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between transient and sustained neural processes during naturalistic vision and highlight the importance of disentangling overlapping neural signals during free viewing.

">The respiratory phase modulates task-related neural representations of visual stimuli</a></h4>

              
                We investigate how respiration influences cognition by examining the interaction between respiratory phase and task-related brain activity during two visual categorization tasks. While prior research shows that cognitive performance varies along the respiratory cycle, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Though some studies have shown that large-scale neural activity reflecting changes in the excitation-inhibition balance is co-modulated with the respiratory cycle, it remains unclear whether respiration directly shapes the quality by which task-relevant sensory information is encoded. We address this gap by applying single-trial multivariate analyses to EEG data obtained in humans, allowing us to track how respiration modulates the sensory evidence in this neurophysiological signal. Confirming previous studies, our data show that participants performance varies with the respiratory phase prior and during a trial. Importantly, they also suggest that respiration directly influences the sensory evidence carried by parieto-occipital processes emerging around 300 to 200 ms prior to participants responses. Hence, respiration and sensory-cognitive processes are not only highly intertwined but respiration directly facilitates the representation of behaviourally-relevant signals in the brain.

Multivariate pattern analysis, Bayesian inference, and a tightly controlled experimental design were used to identify the neural activity that differentiates between memory and imagination of the same events. The results showed that large swaths of the default mode network exhibited identical patterns of activity in recollection and imagination; several frontal areas were involved in imagination (but not in recollection). Representational similarity analysis revealed that the left ventral precuneus exhibited different patterns of memory and imagination. Further examination revealed that this subarea may be especially important for recollection of specific episodes.

We investigate single-trial neural tracking of slow frequency modulations in speech using electroencephalography. Participants briefly listened to unfamiliar single speakers, and in addition, they performed a cocktail party comprehension task. Quantified through stimulus reconstruction methods, robust tracking was found in neural responses to slow (delta-theta range) modulations of frequency contours in the fourth and fifth formant band, equivalent to the 3.5–5 KHz audible range. The spectral spacing between neighboring instantaneous frequency contours (Δ<span style="font-style:italic;">F</span>), which also yields indexical information from the vocal tract, was similarly decodable. Moreover, EEG evidence of listeners’ spectral tracking abilities predicted their chances of succeeding at selective listening when faced with two-speaker speech mixtures. In summary, the results indicate that the communicating brain can rely on locking of cortical rhythms to major changes led by upper resonances of the vocal tract. Their corresponding articulatory mechanics hence continuously issue a fundamental credential for listeners to target in real time.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Spinal astrocytomas (SA) represent 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of all intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCTs) and present significant clinical challenges due to their aggressive behavior and potential for recurrence. We aimed to pool the evidence on SA and investigate predictors of regrowth or recurrence after surgical resection. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on peer-reviewed human studies from several databases covering the field of SA. Data were collected including sex, age, tumor location, extent of resection, histopathological diagnosis, and adjuvant therapy to identify predictors of SA recurrence. Recurrence was defined as failure of local tumor control or regrowth after treatment. Results: A total of 53 studies with 1365 patients were included in the meta-analysis. A postoperative deterioration in neurological outcomes, as assessed by the modified McCormick scale, was noted in most of the patients. The overall recurrence rate amounted to 41%. On meta-analysis, high-grade WHO tumors were associated with higher odds of recurrence (OR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.87, 3.76; p = 0.001). Similarly, GTR was associated with lower odds of recurrence compared to STR (OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.60; p = 0.0003). Sex (p = 0.5848) and tumor location (p = 0.3693) did not show any significant differences in the odds of recurrence. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was described in 8 studies and adjuvant radiotherapy in 41 studies. Conclusions: The results highlight the significant importance of tumor grade and extent of resection in patient prognosis. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy remains unclear, with most studies suggesting no differences in outcomes, with limitations due to potential confounders.</p>

                Climate change significantly affects smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods are closely tied to the environment. This study explores factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impact on crop productivity among small-scale farmers in Nyimba District, Zambia. Data were collected from 194 households across 12 villages, and logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed to identify key factors and evaluate CSA’s effects on crop yields. Findings revealed that CSA adoption is influenced by factors such as education level, household size, fertilizer use, age, gender, farming experience, livestock ownership, income, farmland size, marital status, and access to climate-related information. CSA adopters experienced a 20.20% increase in overall crop yields compared to non-adopters, with a 21.50% increase in maize yields specifically. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions to support CSA adoption through education, improved dissemination of climate information, and access to critical resources such as improved seeds and financial services. This research offers insights for policymakers and extension services to develop evidence-based strategies enhancing resilience and productivity among smallholder farmers in response to climate challenges.

                <p>by Elif Köksal-Ersöz, Pascal Benquet, Fabrice Wendling</p>

Neuroplasticity refers to functional and structural changes in brain regions in response to healthy and pathological activity. Activity dependent plasticity induced by epileptic activity can involve healthy brain regions into the epileptogenic network by perturbing their excitation/inhibition balance. In this article, we present a new neural mass model, which accounts for neuroplasticity, for investigating the possible mechanisms underlying the epileptogenic network expansion. Our multiple-timescale model is inspired by physiological calcium-mediated synaptic plasticity and pathological extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) dependent plasticity dynamics. The model highlights that synaptic plasticity at excitatory connections and structural changes in the inhibitory system can transform a healthy region into a secondary epileptic focus under recurrent seizures and interictal activity occurring in the primary focus. Our results suggest that the latent period of this transformation can provide a window of opportunity to prevent the expansion of epileptogenic networks, formation of an epileptic focus, or other comorbidities associated with epileptic activity.

                <p>by Ikram Mahmoudi, Chloé Quignot, Carla Martins, Jessica Andreani</p>

Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and π-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are linked to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer make interface contacts in the interolog, a phenomenon we term “interface switching out”. We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarios of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.

Sensorimotor learning is supported by multiple competing processes that operate concurrently, making it a challenge to elucidate their neural underpinnings. Here, using human functional MRI, we identify 3 distinct axes of connectivity between the motor cortex and other brain regions during sensorimotor adaptation. These 3 axes uniquely correspond to subjects’ degree of implicit learning, performance errors and explicit strategy use, and involve different brain networks situated at increasing levels of the cortical hierarchy. We test the generalizability of these neural axes to a separate form of motor learning known to rely mainly on explicit processes and show that it is only the Explicit neural axis, composed of higher-order areas in transmodal cortex, that predicts learning in this task. Together, our study uncovers multiple distinct patterns of functional connectivity with motor cortex during sensorimotor adaptation, the component processes that these patterns support, and how they generalize to other forms of motor learning.

Genomic data collected from viral outbreaks can be exploited to reconstruct the dispersal history of viral lineages in a two-dimensional space using continuous phylogeographic inference. These spatially explicit reconstructions can subsequently be used to estimate dispersal metrics that can be informative of the dispersal dynamics and the capacity to spread among hosts. Heterogeneous sampling efforts of genomic sequences can however impact the accuracy of phylogeographic dispersal metrics. While the impact of spatial sampling bias on the outcomes of continuous phylogeographic inference has previously been explored, the impact of sampling intensity (i.e., sampling size) when aiming to characterise dispersal patterns through continuous phylogeographic reconstructions has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. In our study, we use simulations to evaluate the robustness of 3 dispersal metrics — a lineage dispersal velocity, a diffusion coefficient, and an isolation-by-distance (IBD) signal metric — to the sampling intensity. Our results reveal that both the diffusion coefficient and IBD signal metrics appear to be the most robust to the number of samples considered for the phylogeographic reconstruction. We then use these 2 dispersal metrics to compare the dispersal pattern and capacity of various viruses spreading in animal populations. Our comparative analysis reveals a broad range of IBD patterns and diffusion coefficients mostly reflecting the dispersal capacity of the main infected host species but also, in some cases, the likely signature of rapid and/or long-distance dispersal events driven by human-mediated movements through animal trade. Overall, our study provides key recommendations for the use of lineage dispersal metrics to consider in future studies and illustrates their application to compare the spread of viruses in various settings.

                <p>by Benedict G. Hogan, Mary Caswell Stoddard</p>

Hyperspectral imaging—a technique that combines the high spectral resolution of spectrophotometry with the high spatial resolution of photography—holds great promise for the study of animal coloration. However, applications of hyperspectral imaging to questions about the ecology and evolution of animal color remain relatively rare. The approach can be expensive and unwieldy, and we lack user-friendly pipelines for capturing and analyzing hyperspectral data in the context of animal color. Fortunately, costs are decreasing and hyperspectral imagers are improving, particularly in their sensitivity to wavelengths (including ultraviolet) visible to diverse animal species. To highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging for animal coloration studies, we developed a pipeline for capturing, sampling, and analyzing hyperspectral data (here, in the 325 nm to 700 nm range) using avian museum specimens. Specifically, we used the pipeline to characterize the plumage colors of the King bird-of-paradise (<i>Cicinnurus regius</i>), Magnificent bird-of-paradise (<i>C</i>. <i>magnificus</i>), and their putative hybrid, the King of Holland’s bird-of-paradise (<i>C</i>. <i>magnificus x C</i>. <i>regius</i>). We also combined hyperspectral data with 3D digital models to supplement hyperspectral images of each specimen with 3D shape information. Using visual system-independent methods, we found that many plumage patches on the hybrid King of Holland’s bird-of-paradise are—to varying degrees—intermediate relative to those of the parent species. This was true of both pigmentary and structurally colored plumage patches. Using visual system-dependent methods, we showed that only some of the differences in plumage patches among the hybrid and its parent species would be perceivable by birds. Hyperspectral imaging is poised to become the gold standard for many animal coloration applications: comprehensive reflectance data—across the entire surface of an animal specimen—can be obtained in a matter of minutes. Our pipeline provides a practical and flexible roadmap for incorporating hyperspectral imaging into future studies of animal color.
