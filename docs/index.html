              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Median Raphe Nonserotonergic Neurons Modulate Hippocampal Theta Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal theta oscillations (HTOs) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep play an important role in mnemonic processes by coordinating hippocampal and cortical activities. However, it is not fully understood how HTOs are modulated by subcortical regions, including the median raphe nucleus (MnR). The MnR is thought to suppress HTO through its serotonergic outputs. Here, our study on male mice revealed a more complex framework indicating roles of nonserotonergic MnR outputs in regulating HTO. We found that nonselective optogenetic activation of MnR neurons at theta frequency increased HTO amplitude. Granger causality analysis indicated that MnR theta oscillations during REM sleep influence HTO. By using three transgenic mouse lines, we found that MnR serotonergic neurons exhibited little or no theta-correlated activity during HTO. Instead, most MnR GABAergic neurons and Vglut3 neurons respectively increased and decreased activities during HTO and exhibited hippocampal theta phase-locked activities. Although MnR GABAergic neurons do not directly project to the hippocampus, they could modulate HTO through local Vglut3 and serotonergic neurons as we found that MnR GABAergic neurons monosynaptically targeted Vglut3 and serotonergic neurons. Additionally, pontine wave recorded from the MnR during REM sleep accompanied nonserotonergic activity increase and HTO acceleration. These results suggest that MnR nonserotonergic neurons modulate hippocampal theta activity during REM sleep, which regulates memory processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The MnR is the major source of serotonergic inputs to multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and medial septal area. It has long been thought that those serotonergic outputs suppress HTOs. However, our results revealed that MnR serotoninergic neurons displayed little firing changes during HTO. Instead, MnR Vglut3 neurons were largely silent during HTO associated with REM sleep. Additionally, many MnR GABAergic neurons fired rhythmically phase-locked to HTO. These results indicate an important role of MnR nonserotonergic neurons in modulating HTO.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brief Stimuli Cast a Persistent Long-Term Trace in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual processing is strongly influenced by recent stimulus history, a phenomenon termed adaptation. Prominent theories cast adaptation as a consequence of optimized encoding of visual information by exploiting the temporal statistics of the world. However, this would require the visual system to track the history of individual briefly experienced events, within a stream of visual input, to build up statistical representations over longer timescales. Here, using an openly available dataset from the Allen Brain Observatory, we show that neurons in the early visual cortex of the mouse indeed maintain long-term traces of individual past stimuli that persist despite the presentation of several intervening stimuli, leading to long-term and stimulus-specific adaptation over dozens of seconds. Long-term adaptation was selectively expressed in cortical, but not in thalamic, neurons, which only showed short-term adaptation. Early visual cortex thus maintains concurrent stimulus-specific memory traces of past input, enabling the visual system to build up a statistical representation of the world to optimize the encoding of new information in a changing environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the natural world, previous sensory input is predictive of current input over multisecond timescales. The visual system could exploit these predictabilities by adapting current visual processing to the long-term history of visual input. However, it is unclear whether the visual system can track the history of individual briefly experienced images, within a stream of input, to build up statistical representations over such long timescales. Here, we show that neurons in early visual cortex of the mouse brain exhibit remarkably long-term adaptation to brief stimuli, persisting over dozens of seconds, and despite the presentation of several intervening stimuli. The visual cortex thus maintains long-term traces of individual briefly experienced past images, enabling the formation of statistical representations over extended timescales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Conditioned Place Preference for Heroin Is Signaled by Increased Dopamine and Direct Pathway Activity and Decreased Indirect Pathway Activity in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repeated pairing of a drug with a neutral stimulus, such as a cue or context, leads to the attribution of the drug's reinforcing properties to that stimulus, and exposure to that stimulus in the absence of the drug can elicit drug-seeking. A principal role for the NAc in the response to drug-associated stimuli has been well documented. Direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs) have been shown to bidirectionally regulate cue-induced heroin-seeking in rats expressing addiction-like phenotypes, and a shift in NAc activity toward the direct pathway has been shown in mice following cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). However, how NAc signaling guides heroin CPP, and whether heroin alters the balance of signaling between dMSNs and iMSNs, remains unknown. Moreover, the role of NAc dopamine signaling in heroin reinforcement is unclear. Here, we integrate fiber photometry for <I>in vivo</I> monitoring of dopamine and dMSN/iMSN calcium activity with a heroin CPP procedure in rats to begin to address these questions. We identify a sensitization-like response to heroin in the NAc, with prominent iMSN activity during initial heroin exposure and prominent dMSN activity following repeated heroin exposure. We demonstrate a ramp in dopamine activity, dMSN activation, and iMSN inactivation preceding entry into a heroin-paired context, and a decrease in dopamine activity, dMSN inactivation, and iMSN activation preceding exit from a heroin-paired context. Finally, we show that buprenorphine is sufficient to prevent the development of heroin CPP and reduce Fos activation in the NAc after conditioning. Together, these data support the hypothesis that an imbalance in NAc activity contributes to the development of drug-cue associations that can drive addiction processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The attribution of the reinforcing effects of drugs to neutral stimuli (e.g., cues and contexts) contributes to the long-standing nature of addiction, as re-exposure to drug-associated stimuli can reinstate drug-seeking and -taking even after long periods of abstinence. The NAc has an established role in encoding the value of drug-associated stimuli, and dopamine release into the NAc is known to modulate the reinforcing effects of drugs, including heroin. Using fiber photometry, we show that entering a heroin-paired context is driven by dopamine signaling and NAc direct pathway activation, whereas exiting a heroin-paired context is driven by NAc indirect pathway activation. This study provides further insight into the role of NAc microcircuitry in encoding the reinforcing properties of heroin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Interruption of Auditory Interhemispheric Cross Talk Impairs Discrimination Learning of Frequency-Modulated Tone Direction But Not Gap Detection and Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Functional hemispheric lateralization is a basic principle of brain organization. In the auditory domain, the right auditory cortex (AC) determines the pitch direction of continuous auditory stimuli whereas the left AC discriminates gaps in these stimuli. The involved functional interactions between the two sides, mediated by commissural connections, are poorly understood. Here, we selectively disrupted the interhemispheric cross talk from the left to the right primary AC and vice versa using chromophore-targeted laser-induced apoptosis of the respective projection neurons, which make up 6&ndash;17% of all AC neurons in Layers III, V, and VI. Following photolysis, male gerbils were trained in a first experimental set to discriminate between rising and falling frequency-modulated (FM) tone sweeps. The acquisition of the task was significantly delayed in lesioned animals of either lesion direction. However, the final discrimination performance and hit rate was lowest for animals with left-side lesioned commissural neurons, demonstrating that also information from the left AC is relevant for FM direction learning. Photolysis after successful learning did not affect the retrieval of the learned task, indicating that the disruption during learning was not because of a general functional impairment. In a second experimental set, the gerbil's ability to detect and discriminate small silent gaps of varying length within FM sweeps was tested. This ability was also preserved after interhemispheric disruption. Taken together, interhemispheric communication between the left and right AC is important for the acquisition of FM tone direction learning but not for its retrieval and for gap detection and gap duration discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hemispheric lateralization of neuronal functions such as speech and music processing in humans are common throughout the brain; however, the involved interhemispheric interactions are ill-defined. Here, we show that the selective photolytic disruption of auditory cortical commissural connections in rodents impairs the acquisition but not retrieval of a frequency-modulated tone direction discrimination task. The final discrimination performance and hit rate was lowest for animals with lesioned left-to-right-side projections; thus, although right auditory cortex is dominant, left auditory cortex is also relevant for learning this task. The detection and discrimination of small gaps within the tone sweeps remain intact, suggesting a pathway for the processing of these temporal structures, which could be independent from the lesioned interhemispheric cross talk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Opposing Roles of the Dorsolateral and Dorsomedial Striatum in the Acquisition of Skilled Action Sequencing in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The shift in control from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum during skill and habit formation has been well established, but whether striatal subregions orchestrate this shift cooperatively or competitively remains unclear. Cortical inputs have also been implicated in the shift toward automaticity, but it is unknown whether they mirror their downstream striatal targets across this transition. We addressed these questions using a five step heterogeneous action sequencing task in male rats that is optimally performed by automated chains of actions. By optimizing automatic habitual responding, we discovered that loss of function in the dorsomedial striatum accelerated sequence acquisition. In contrast, loss of function in the dorsolateral striatum impeded acquisition of sequencing, demonstrating functional opposition within the striatum. Unexpectedly, the mPFC was not involved; however, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was critical. These results shift current theories about striatal control of behavior to a model of competitive opposition, where the dorsomedial striatum interferes with the development of dorsolateral-striatum dependent behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide the most direct evidence to date that the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum compete for control in the acquisition of habitual action sequences. The dorsolateral striatum was critical for sequencing behavior, but loss of dorsomedial striatum function enhanced acquisition. In addition, we found that the mPFC was not required for the formation of automated actions. Using a task that optimizes habitual responding, we demonstrate that the arbitration of dorsomedial and dorsolateral control is not modulated by medial prefrontal cortical activity. However, we find evidence for the role of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex in action sequencing. These results have implications for our understanding of how habits and skills form.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency Shapes the Quality of Tactile Percepts Evoked through Electrical Stimulation of the Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves of human participants provides a unique opportunity to study the neural determinants of perceptual quality using a causal manipulation. A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to isolate the role of spike timing&mdash;at the scale of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds&mdash;in shaping the sensory experience. In the present study, we address this question by systematically varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical stimulation pulse trains delivered to the peripheral nerves of seven participants with upper and lower extremity limb loss via chronically implanted neural interfaces. We find that increases in PF lead to systematic increases in perceived frequency, up to ~50 Hz, at which point further changes in PF have little to no impact on sensory quality. Above this transition frequency, ratings of perceived frequency level off, the ability to discriminate changes in PF is abolished, and verbal descriptors selected to characterize the sensation change abruptly. We conclude that sensation quality is shaped by temporal patterns of neural activation, even if these patterns are imposed on a fixed neural population, but this temporal patterning can only be resolved up to ~50 Hz. These findings highlight the importance of spike timing in shaping the quality of a sensation and will contribute to the development of encoding strategies for conveying touch feedback through bionic hands and feet.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to understand how temporal patterns in neuronal responses shape the sensory experience. We address this question by varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical pulse trains delivered through implanted nerve interfaces in seven amputees. We concomitantly vary pulse width to separate the effect of changing PF on sensory quality from its effect on perceived magnitude. We find that increases in PF lead to increases in perceived frequency, a qualitative dimension, up to ~50 Hz, beyond which changes in PF have little impact on quality. We conclude that temporal patterning in the neuronal response can shape quality and discuss the implications for restoring touch via neural interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hemin-Induced Death Models Hemorrhagic Stroke and Is a Variant of Classical Neuronal Ferroptosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ferroptosis is a caspase-independent, iron-dependent form of regulated necrosis extant in traumatic brain injury, Huntington disease, and hemorrhagic stroke. It can be activated by cystine deprivation leading to glutathione depletion, the insufficiency of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase-4, and the hemolysis products hemoglobin and hemin. A cardinal feature of ferroptosis is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation culminating in its translocation to the nucleus. We have previously confirmed that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 inhibits persistent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ferroptosis. Here, we show that hemin exposure, a model of secondary injury in brain hemorrhage and ferroptosis, activated ERK1/2 in mouse neurons. Accordingly, MEK inhibitor U0126 protected against hemin-induced ferroptosis. Unexpectedly, U0126 prevented hemin-induced ferroptosis independent of its ability to inhibit ERK1/2 signaling. In contrast to classical ferroptosis in neurons or cancer cells, chemically diverse inhibitors of MEK did not block hemin-induced ferroptosis, nor did the forced expression of the ERK-selective MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP)3. We conclude that hemin or hemoglobin-induced ferroptosis, unlike glutathione depletion, is ERK1/2-independent. Together with recent studies, our findings suggest the existence of a novel subtype of neuronal ferroptosis relevant to bleeding in the brain that is 5-lipoxygenase-dependent, ERK-independent, and transcription-independent. Remarkably, our unbiased phosphoproteome analysis revealed dramatic differences in phosphorylation induced by two ferroptosis subtypes. As U0126 also reduced cell death and improved functional recovery after hemorrhagic stroke in male mice, our analysis also provides a template on which to build a search for U0126's effects in a variant of neuronal ferroptosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent mechanism of regulated necrosis that has been linked to hemorrhagic stroke. Common features of ferroptotic death induced by diverse stimuli are the depletion of the antioxidant glutathione, production of lipoxygenase-dependent reactive lipids, sensitivity to iron chelation, and persistent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Unlike classical ferroptosis induced in neurons or cancer cells, here we show that ferroptosis induced by hemin is ERK-independent. Paradoxically, the canonical MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 blocks brain hemorrhage-induced death. Altogether, these data suggest that a variant of ferroptosis is unleashed in hemorrhagic stroke. We present the first, unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis of ferroptosis as a template on which to understand distinct paths to cell death that meet the definition of ferroptosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulation of the Basal Ganglia Indirect Pathway in Early Symptomatic Q175 Huntington's Disease Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The debilitating psychomotor symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) are linked partly to degeneration of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. At early symptomatic stages, before major cell loss, indirect pathway neurons exhibit numerous cellular and synaptic changes in HD and its models. However, the impact of these alterations on circuit activity remains poorly understood. To address this gap, optogenetic- and reporter-guided electrophysiological interrogation was used in early symptomatic male and female <I>Q175</I> HD mice. D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (D2-SPNs) were hypoactive during synchronous cortical slow-wave activity, consistent with known reductions in dendritic excitability and cortical input strength. Downstream prototypic parvalbumin-expressing external globus pallidus (PV<sup>+</sup> GPe) neurons discharged at 2-3 times their normal rate, even during periods of D2-SPN inactivity, arguing that defective striatopallidal inhibition was not the only cause of their hyperactivity. Indeed, PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neurons also exhibited abnormally elevated autonomous firing <I>ex vivo</I>. Optogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neurons <I>in vivo</I> partially and fully ameliorated the abnormal hypoactivity of postsynaptic subthalamic nucleus (STN) and putative PV<sup>&ndash;</sup> GPe neurons, respectively. In contrast to STN neurons whose autonomous firing is impaired in HD mice, putative PV<sup>&ndash;</sup> GPe neuron activity was unaffected <I>ex vivo</I>, implying that excessive inhibition was responsible for their hypoactivity <I>in vivo</I>. Together with previous studies, these data demonstrate that (1) indirect pathway nuclei are dysregulated in <I>Q175</I> mice through changes in presynaptic activity and/or intrinsic cellular and synaptic properties; and (2) prototypic PV<sup>+</sup> GPe neuron hyperactivity and excessive target inhibition are prominent features of early HD pathophysiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The early symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) are linked to degenerative changes in the action-suppressing indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. Consistent with this linkage, the intrinsic properties of cells in this pathway exhibit complex alterations in HD and its models. However, the impact of these changes on activity is poorly understood. Using electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that the indirect pathway is highly dysregulated in early symptomatic HD mice through changes in upstream activity and/or intrinsic properties. Furthermore, we reveal that hyperactivity of external globus pallidus neurons and excessive inhibition of their targets are key features of early HD pathophysiology. Together, these findings could help to inform the development and targeting of viral-based, gene therapeutic approaches for HD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms and Consequences of Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Disinhibition in a Mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In addition to debilitating muscle degeneration, patients display a range of cognitive deficits thought to result from the loss of dystrophin normally expressed in the brain. While the function of dystrophin in muscle tissue is well characterized, its role in the brain is still poorly understood. The highest expression of dystrophin in the mouse brain is in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), where it colocalizes with GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor clusters. Using <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiological recordings from connected molecular layer interneuron (MLI)&ndash;PC pairs, we investigated changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission caused by dystrophin deficiency. In male <I>mdx</I> mice (which lack long-form dystrophin), we found that responses at MLI&ndash;PC pairs were reduced by ~60% because of both decreased quantal response amplitude and a reduced number of functional vesicle release sites. Using electron microscopy, we found significantly fewer and smaller anatomically defined inhibitory synapses contacting the soma of PCs in <I>mdx</I> mice, suggesting that dystrophin may play a critical role in synapse formation and/or maintenance. Functionally, we found reduced MLI-evoked pauses in PC firing in acute slices. <I>In vivo</I> recordings from awake <I>mdx</I> mice showed increased sensory-evoked simple spike firing in positively modulating PCs, consistent with reduced feedforward inhibition, but no change in negatively modulating PCs. These data suggest that dystrophin deficiency in PCs disrupts inhibitory signaling in the cerebellar circuit and PC firing patterns, potentially contributing to cognitive and motor deficits observed in <I>mdx</I> mice and DMD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is primarily characterized by progressive muscle weakening caused by genetic mutations in the gene for dystrophin. Dystrophin is also normally expressed in the CNS, and DMD patients experience a range of nonprogressive cognitive deficits. The pathophysiology of CNS neurons resulting from loss of dystrophin and the function of dystrophin in neurons are still poorly understood. Using cerebellar PCs as a model, we found that the loss of dystrophin specifically disrupts the number and strength of inhibitory synaptic connections, suggesting that dystrophin participates in formation and/or maintenance of these synapses. This work provides insight into the function of dystrophin in the CNS and establishes neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, which may underlie cognitive deficits in DMD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathogenic Mechanisms of Cytosolic and Membrane-Enriched {alpha}-Synuclein Converge on Fatty Acid Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;-Synuclein (&alpha;S) plays a key role in Parkinson's disease. Although Parkinson's disease is typically "sporadic," inherited &alpha;S missense mutations provide crucial insights into molecular mechanisms. Here, we examine two clinical mutants, E46K and G51D, which are both in the conserved N-terminus that mediates transient &alpha;S-membrane interactions. However, E46K increases and G51D decreases &alpha;S-membrane interactions. Previously, we amplified E46K via the 11-residue repeat motifs, creating "3K" (E35K+E46K+E61K). Here, we engineered these motifs to amplify G51D (V40D+G51D+V66D = "3D") and systematically compared E46K/3K versus G51D/3D. We found that G51D increased cytosolic &alpha;S in neural cells and 3D aggravates this. G51D, and 3D even more, reduced &alpha;S multimer-to-monomer (&alpha;S60:&alpha;S14) ratio. Both amplified variants caused cellular stress in rat primary neurons and reduced growth in human neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, both 3K- and 3D-induced stress was ameliorated by pharmacologically inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase or by conditioning the cells in palmitic (16:0) or myristic (14:0) acid. SCD inhibition lowered lipid-droplet accumulation in both 3D- and 3K-expressing cells and benefitted G51D by normalizing multimer:monomer ratio, as reported previously for E46K. Our findings suggest that, despite divergent cytosol/membrane partitioning, both G51D and E46K neurotoxicity can be prevented by decreasing fatty-acid unsaturation as a common therapeutic approach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> &alpha;-Synuclein (&alpha;S) dyshomeostasis is linked to Parkinson's disease. Here we focus on two contrasting familial-Parkinson's disease &alpha;S mutants, E46K and G51D, that alter &alpha;S membrane association in opposite directions (E46K increases, G51D decreases it). Taking advantage of &alpha;S repeat structure, here we designed &alpha;S "3D," an amplified G51D variant (V40D+G51D+V66D). &alpha;S 3D further enhanced G51D's cytosolic enrichment. Systematic comparison of G51D/3D with membrane-enriched E46K/its amplified variant 3K revealed that both can elicit stress in human neural cells and primary rodent neurons. This toxicity can be ameliorated by inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase or by saturated fatty acid conditioning. Thus, despite divergent membrane binding, both G51D and E46K &alpha;S dyshomeostasis are mitigated by altering fatty acid saturation as a shared target.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Temporal Lobe Networks in Alzheimer's Disease: Structural and Molecular Vulnerabilities</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is connected to the rest of the brain through two main networks: the anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM) systems. Given the crucial role of the MTL and networks in the physiopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present study aimed at (1) investigating whether MTL atrophy propagates specifically within the AT and PM networks, and (2) evaluating the vulnerability of these networks to AD proteinopathies. To do that, we used neuroimaging data acquired in human male and female in three distinct cohorts: (1) resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the aging brain cohort (ABC) to define the AT and PM networks (<I>n</I> = 68); (2) longitudinal structural MRI from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)GO/2 to highlight structural covariance patterns (<I>n</I> = 349); and (3) positron emission tomography (PET) data from ADNI3 to evaluate the networks' vulnerability to amyloid and tau (<I>n</I> = 186). Our results suggest that the atrophy of distinct MTL subregions propagates within the AT and PM networks in a dissociable manner. Brodmann area (BA)35 structurally covaried within the AT network while the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) covaried within the PM network. In addition, these networks are differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, with higher tau levels in AT than in PM and higher amyloid levels in PM than in AT. Our results also suggest differences in the relative burden of tau species. The current results provide further support for the notion that two distinct MTL networks display differential alterations in the context of AD. These findings have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study provides further support for the notion that two distinct medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks, i.e., anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM), display differential alterations in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, neurodegeneration appears to occur within these networks in a dissociable manner marked by their covariance patterns. In addition, the AT and PM networks are also differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, and perhaps differences in the relative burden of tau species [e.g., neurofibriliary tangles (NFTs) vs tau in neuritic plaques]. These findings, in the context of a growing literature consistent with the present results, have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD in light of the differential cognitive processes ascribed to them.</p>

                <p>Neuroimmunometabolism is an emerging field that examines the intersection of immunologic and metabolic cascades in the brain. Neuroinflammatory conditions often involve differential metabolic reprogramming in neuronal and glial cells through their immunometabolic sensors. The impact of such bioenergetic adaptation on general brain function is poorly understood, but this cross-talk becomes increasingly important in neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit reshaping of neuroimmunometabolic pathways. Here we summarize the intrinsic balance of neuroimmunometabolic substrates and sensors in the healthy brain and how their dysregulation can contribute to the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative disorders. This review also proposes possible avenues for disease management through neuroimmunometabolic profiling and therapeutics to bridge translational gaps and guide future treatment strategies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroimmunometabolism intersects with neuroinflammation and immunometabolic regulation of neurons and glial cells in the CNS. There is emerging evidence that neuroimmunometabolism plays an essential role in the manifestation of CNS degeneration. This review highlights how neuroimmunometabolic homeostasis is disrupted in various neurodegenerative conditions and could be a target for new therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endothelial Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 4 Regulates Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability and Promotes a Homeostatic Endothelial Phenotype</a></h4>

              
                <p>The precise regulation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability for immune cells and blood-borne substances is essential to maintain brain homeostasis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule enriched in plasma, is known to affect BBB permeability. Previous studies focused on endothelial S1P receptors 1 and 2, reporting a barrier-protective effect of S1P1 and a barrier-disruptive effect of S1P2. Here, we present novel data characterizing the expression, localization, and function of the S1P receptor 4 (S1P4) on primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Hitherto, the receptor was deemed to be exclusively immune cell associated. We detected a robust expression of S1P4 in homeostatic murine BMECs (MBMECs), bovine BMECs (BBMECs), and porcine BMECs (PBMECs) and pinpointed its localization to abluminal endothelial membranes via immunoblotting of fractionated brain endothelial membrane fragments. Apical S1P treatment of BMECs tightened the endothelial barrier <I>in vitro</I>, whereas basolateral S1P treatment led to an increased permeability that correlated with S1P4 downregulation. Likewise, downregulation of S1P4 was observed in mouse brain microvessels (MBMVs) after stroke, a neurologic disease associated with BBB impairment. RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis of BMECs suggested the involvement of S1P4 in endothelial homeostasis and barrier function. Using S1P4 knock-out (KO) mice and S1P4 siRNA as well as pharmacological agonists and antagonists of S1P4 both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>, we demonstrate an overall barrier-protective function of S1P4. We therefore suggest S1P4 as a novel target regulating BBB permeability and propose its therapeutic potential in CNS diseases associated with BBB dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many neurologic diseases including multiple sclerosis and stroke are associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and disturbed brain homeostasis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) are potent regulators of endothelial permeability and pharmacological S1PR modulators are already in clinical use. However, the precise role of S1P for BBB permeability regulation and the function of receptors other than S1P1 and S1P2 therein are still unclear. Our study shows both barrier-disruptive and barrier-protective effects of S1P at the BBB that depend on receptor polarization. We demonstrate the expression and novel barrier-protective function of S1P4 in brain endothelial cells and pinpoint its localization to abluminal membranes. Our work may contribute to the development of novel specific S1PR modulators for the treatment of neurologic diseases associated with BBB impairment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Female-Specific Role for Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in Rodent Pain Models</a></h4>

              
                <p>We aimed to investigate a sexually dimorphic role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rodent models of pain. Based on findings in migraine where CGRP has a preferential pain-promoting effect in female rodents, we hypothesized that CGRP antagonists and antibodies would attenuate pain sensitization more efficaciously in female than male mice and rats. In hyperalgesic priming induced by activation of interleukin 6 signaling, CGRP receptor antagonists olcegepant and CGRP<SUB>8-37</SUB> both given intrathecally, blocked, and reversed hyperalgesic priming only in females. A monoclonal antibody against CGRP, given systemically, blocked priming specifically in female rodents but failed to reverse it. In the spared nerve injury model, there was a transient effect of both CGRP antagonists, given intrathecally, on mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice only. Consistent with these findings, intrathecally applied CGRP caused a long-lasting, dose-dependent mechanical hypersensitivity in female mice but more transient effects in males. This CGRP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was reversed by olcegepant and the KCC2 enhancer CLP257, suggesting a role for anionic plasticity in the dorsal horn in the pain-promoting effects of CGRP in females. In spinal dorsal horn slices, CGRP shifted GABA<SUB>A</SUB> reversal potentials to significantly more positive values, but, again, only in female mice. Therefore, CGRP may regulate KCC2 expression and/or activity downstream of CGRP receptors specifically in females. However, KCC2 hypofunction promotes mechanical pain hypersensitivity in both sexes because CLP257 alleviated hyperalgesic priming in male and female mice. We conclude that CGRP promotes pain plasticity in female rodents but has a limited impact in males.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The majority of patients impacted by chronic pain are women. Mechanistic studies in rodents are creating a clear picture that molecular events promoting chronic pain are different in male and female animals. We sought to build on evidence showing that CGRP is a more potent and efficacious promoter of headache in female than in male rodents. To test this, we used hyperalgesic priming and the spared nerve injury neuropathic pain models in mice. Our findings show a clear sex dimorphism wherein CGRP promotes pain in female but not male mice, likely via a centrally mediated mechanism of action. Our work suggests that CGRP receptor antagonists could be tested for efficacy in women for a broader variety of pain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PTEN Regulates Dendritic Arborization by Decreasing Microtubule Polymerization Rate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in <I>PTEN</I> have been found in a subset of patients with macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). PTEN loss in neurons leads to somal hypertrophy, aberrant migration, dendritic overgrowth, increased spine density, and hyperactivity of neuronal circuits. These neuronal overgrowth phenotypes are present on <I>Pten</I> knock-out (KO) and reconstitution with autism-associated point mutations. The mechanism underlying dendritic overgrowth in <I>Pten</I> deficient neurons is unclear. In this study, we examined how <I>Pten</I> loss impacts microtubule (MT) dynamics in both sexes using retroviral infection and transfection strategies to manipulate PTEN expression and tag the plus-end MT binding protein, end-binding protein 3 (EB3). We found <I>Pten</I> KO neurons sprout more new processes over time compared with wild-type (WT) neurons. We also found an increase in MT polymerization rate in <I>Pten</I> KO dendritic growth cones. Reducing MT polymerization rate to the WT level was sufficient to reduce dendritic overgrowth in <I>Pten</I> KO neurons <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Finally, we found that rescue of dendritic overgrowth via inhibition of MT polymerization was sufficient to improve the performance of <I>Pten</I> KO mice in a spatial memory task. Taken together, our data suggests that one factor underlying PTEN loss dependent dendritic overgrowth is increased MT polymerization. This opens the possibility for an intersectional approach targeting MT polymerization and mTOR with low doses of inhibitors to achieve therapeutic gains with minimal side effects in pathologies associated with loss of neuronal PTEN function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of <I>Pten</I> function because of genetic deletion or expression of mutations associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), results in overgrowth of neurons including increased total dendritic length and branching. We have discovered that this overgrowth is accompanied by increased rate of microtubule (MT) polymerization. The increased polymerization rate is insensitive to acute inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 or protein synthesis. Direct pharmacological inhibition of MT polymerization can slow the polymerization rate in <I>Pten</I> knock-out (KO) neurons to rates seen in wild-type (WT) neurons. Correction of the MT polymerization rate rescues increased total dendritic arborization and spatial memory. Our studies suggest that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibits dendritic growth through parallel regulation of protein synthesis and cytoskeletal polymerization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons of the Spinal Cord Superficial Dorsal Horn Diverge in Their Somatosensory Responses and Plasticity in Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>The superficial dorsal horn (SDH) of the spinal cord represents the first site of integration between innocuous and noxious somatosensory stimuli. According to gate control theory, diverse populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the SDH are activated by distinct sensory afferents, and their interplay determines the net nociceptive output projecting to higher pain centers. Although specific SDH cell types are ill defined, numerous classifications schemes find that excitatory and inhibitory neurons fundamentally differ in their morphology, electrophysiology, neuropeptides, and pain-associated plasticity; yet little is known about how these neurons respond over a range of natural innocuous and noxious stimuli. To address this question, we applied an <I>in vivo</I> imaging approach in male mice where the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s was expressed either in vGluT2-positive excitatory or vIAAT-positive inhibitory neurons. We found that inhibitory neurons were markedly more sensitive to innocuous touch than excitatory neurons but still responded dynamically over a wide range of noxious mechanical stimuli. Inhibitory neurons were also less sensitive to thermal stimuli than their excitatory counterparts. In a capsaicin model of acute pain sensitization, the responses of excitatory neurons were significantly potentiated to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli, whereas inhibitory neural responses were only depressed to noxious stimuli. These <I>in vivo</I> findings show that excitatory and inhibitory SDH neurons diverge considerably in their somatosensory responses and plasticity, as postulated by gate control theory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Gate control theory posits that opposing spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, differently tuned across somatosensory modalities, determine the net nociceptive output to higher pain centers. Little is known about how natural stimuli activate these two neural populations. This study applied an <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging approach to genetically target these neurons and contrast their responses over a range of innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli. Compared with excitatory neurons, we found that inhibitory neurons are more sensitive to innocuous touch and far less sensitive to thermal stimuli. An acute model of pain also revealed that these subtypes undergo divergent mechanosensory plasticity. Our data provide important and novel insights for gate-control inspired models of pain processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Performance-Dependent Consolidation of Learned Vocal Changes in Adult Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor skills learned through practice are consolidated at later time, which can include nighttime, but the time course of motor memory consolidation and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated neural substrates underlying motor memory consolidation of learned changes in birdsong, a tractable model system for studying neural basis of motor skill learning. Previous studies in male zebra finches and Bengalese finches have demonstrated that adaptive changes in adult song structure learned through a reinforcement paradigm are initially driven by a cortical-basal ganglia circuit, and subsequently consolidated into downstream cortical motor circuitry. However, the time course of the consolidation process, including whether it occurs offline during nighttime or online during daytime, remains unclear and even controversial. Here, we provide in both species experimental evidence of virtually no consolidation of learned vocal changes during nighttime. We demonstrate instead that the consolidation occurs during daytime and the amount of consolidation is strongly correlated with the amount of learning, suggesting online, performance-dependent mechanisms of consolidation of learned vocal changes. Moreover, by using computer simulations based on our experimental results, we demonstrate that such online, performance-dependent consolidation can account for the contradicting conclusions concerning the time course of consolidation process reached by previous studies. These results thus reconcile a controversy in the study of vocal motor consolidation in songbirds, and illustrate the neural substrates through which newly learned motor skills initially implemented by cortical-basal ganglia circuits become encoded in the cortical motor circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor skills learned through repetitive practice become stable and are consolidated into cortical motor circuits. We investigate neural substrates of this "motor memory consolidation" in adult songbirds, which produce songs that are complex motor skills learned and maintained through repetitive vocal practice. We demonstrate that learned changes in song acoustic structure are consolidated into the cortical motor circuits predominantly during daytime, but not during nighttime, depending on ongoing song performance. These consolidation mechanisms reconcile seemingly contradicting results of previous studies regarding the time course of vocal learning consolidation, and provide fundamental insights into the process through which learned performance of complex motor skills is consolidated and encoded in in motor circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular mechanisms of flavonoids and their modulatory effects against breast cancer: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. It is a disease whose incidence and mortality rates are on the upsurge globally. Debilitating effects, cost and resistance to available chemotherapeutic interventions render them unideal. Dietary phytochemicals have been shown to have preventive and therapeutic effects. Research continues to affirm the role of flavonoids as potential chemotherapeutic agents in combating the disease. Understanding modulation of key cellular signalling pathways by flavonoids presents promising molecular targets that may be leveraged to develop better chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer. Methods:  To describe the in vitro and in vivo modulatory effects of flavonoids on molecular anti-cancer mechanisms we searched three databases. We included original articles describing modulation of cell signalling processes such as; cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, angiogenesis, invasion and migration which are involved in tumorigenesis. The search guidelines such as; year of publication, search strategy, study design and language informed article selection. Results: Thirty-six articles were reviewed. Modulatory effects of six subclasses of flavonoids on breast cancer tumorigenic pathways were reported. The effects included enhanced apoptosis, attenuation of; angiogenesis, cell cycle, invasion, migration and metastasis. For instance, pectolinarigenin inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) signalling pathway in triple negative breast cancer. Whereas, sideritoflavone caused cell cycle arrest and inhibited migration in trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells. Additionally, quercetin and ampelopsin inhibited stemness features in triple negative breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Evidently flavonoids showed significant modulatory effects on cellular signalling pathways crucial for breast cancer progression. The ability of flavonoids to act on a wide range of mechanisms as well as on aggressive breast cancer types presents an array of hope. We recommend that further studies be done to ascertain the applicability of these compounds in treatment of breast cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 bacteriophage potential in human gut microbiota [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In previous studies we have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth, and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. These observations are compatible with a ‘bacteriophage-like’ behaviour of SARS-CoV-2.  Methods: We have further elaborated on these unusual findings and here we present the results of three different supplementary experiments: (1) an electron-microscope analysis of samples of  bacteria obtained from a faecal sample of a subject positive to SARS-CoV-2; (2) mass spectrometric analysis of these cultures to assess the eventual de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (3) sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 collected from plaques obtained from two different gut microbial bacteria inoculated with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Results: Immuno-labelling with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 both outside and inside bacteria. De novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed, as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is translated in the bacterial cultures. In addition, phage-like plaques were spotted on faecal bacteria cultures after inoculation with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic analyses on the reads obtained by sequencing RNA extracted from the plaques revealed nucleic acid polymorphisms, suggesting different replication environment in the two bacterial cultures. Conclusions: Based on these results we conclude that, in addition to its well-documented interactions with eukaryotic cells, SARS-CoV-2 may act as a bacteriophage when interacting with at least two bacterial species known to be present in the human microbiota. If the hypothesis proposed, i.e., that under certain conditions SARS-CoV-2 may multiply at the expense of human gut bacteria, is further substantiated, it would drastically change the model of acting and infecting of SARS-CoV-2, and most likely that of other human pathogenic viruses.

                Myelin is an essential component of the nervous system and myelin damage causes demyelination diseases. Myelin is a sheet of oligodendrocyte membrane wrapped around the neuronal axon. In the fluorescent images, experts manually identify myelin by co-localization of oligodendrocyte and axonal membranes that fit certain shape and size criteria. Because myelin wriggles along x-y-z axes, machine learning is ideal for its segmentation. However, machine-learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require a high number of annotated images, which necessitate expert labor. To facilitate myelin annotation, we developed a workflow and software for myelin ground truth extraction from multi-spectral fluorescent images. Additionally,  to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a set of annotated myelin ground truths for machine learning applications were shared with the community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian inference of ancestral recombination graphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Mahmoudi, Jere Koskela, Jerome Kelleher, Yao-ban Chan, David Balding</p>

We present a novel algorithm, implemented in the software <i>ARGinfer</i>, for probabilistic inference of the Ancestral Recombination Graph under the Coalescent with Recombination. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm takes advantage of the Succinct Tree Sequence data structure that has allowed great advances in simulation and point estimation, but not yet probabilistic inference. Unlike previous methods, which employ the Sequentially Markov Coalescent approximation, <i>ARGinfer</i> uses the Coalescent with Recombination, allowing more accurate inference of key evolutionary parameters. We show using simulations that <i>ARGinfer</i> can accurately estimate many properties of the evolutionary history of the sample, including the topology and branch lengths of the genealogical tree at each sequence site, and the times and locations of mutation and recombination events. <i>ARGinfer</i> approximates posterior probability distributions for these and other quantities, providing interpretable assessments of uncertainty that we show to be well calibrated. <i>ARGinfer</i> is currently limited to tens of DNA sequences of several hundreds of kilobases, but has scope for further computational improvements to increase its applicability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Base-resolution prediction of transcription factor binding signals by a deep learning framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qinhu Zhang, Ying He, Siguo Wang, Zhanheng Chen, Zhenhao Guo, Zhen Cui, Qi Liu, De-Shuang Huang</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in regulating gene expression, thus the identification of the sites bound by them has become a fundamental step for molecular and cellular biology. In this paper, we developed a deep learning framework leveraging existing fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) to predict TF-DNA binding signals at the base-resolution level (named as FCNsignal). The proposed FCNsignal can simultaneously achieve the following tasks: (i) modeling the base-resolution signals of binding regions; (ii) discriminating binding or non-binding regions; (iii) locating TF-DNA binding regions; (iv) predicting binding motifs. Besides, FCNsignal can also be used to predict opening regions across the whole genome. The experimental results on 53 TF ChIP-seq datasets and 6 chromatin accessibility ATAC-seq datasets show that our proposed framework outperforms some existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we explored to use the trained FCNsignal to locate all potential TF-DNA binding regions on a whole chromosome and predict DNA sequences of arbitrary length, and the results show that our framework can find most of the known binding regions and accept sequences of arbitrary length. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential ability of our framework in discovering causal disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) through a series of experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Urgent need for consistent standards in functional enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kaumadi Wijesooriya, Sameer A. Jadaan, Kaushalya L. Perera, Tanuveer Kaur, Mark Ziemann</p>

Gene set enrichment tests (a.k.a. functional enrichment analysis) are among the most frequently used methods in computational biology. Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of the spatial heterogeneity of resistant cells and fibroblasts on treatment response</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masud M A, Jae-Young Kim, Cheol-Ho Pan, Eunjung Kim</p>

A long-standing practice in the treatment of cancer is that of hitting hard with the maximum tolerated dose to eradicate tumors. This continuous therapy, however, selects for resistant cells, leading to the failure of the treatment. A different type of treatment strategy, adaptive therapy, has recently been shown to have a degree of success in both preclinical xenograft experiments and clinical trials. Adaptive therapy is used to maintain a tumor’s volume by exploiting the competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells with minimum effective drug doses or timed drug holidays. To further understand the role of competition in the outcomes of adaptive therapy, we developed a 2D on-lattice agent-based model. Our simulations show that the superiority of the adaptive strategy over continuous therapy depends on the local competition shaped by the spatial distribution of resistant cells. Intratumor competition can also be affected by fibroblasts, which produce microenvironmental factors that promote cancer cell growth. To this end, we simulated the impact of different fibroblast distributions on treatment outcomes. As a proof of principle, we focused on five types of distribution of fibroblasts characterized by different locations, shapes, and orientations of the fibroblast region with respect to the resistant cells. Our simulation shows that the spatial architecture of fibroblasts modulates tumor progression in both continuous and adaptive therapy. Finally, as a proof of concept, we simulated the outcomes of adaptive therapy of a virtual patient with four metastatic sites composed of different spatial distributions of fibroblasts and drug-resistant cell populations. Our simulation highlights the importance of undetected metastatic lesions on adaptive therapy outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic features predict prognosis in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Yao, Evelien Schaafsma, Baoyi Zhang, Chao Cheng</p>

Although estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is generally associated with favorable prognosis, clinical outcome varies substantially among patients. Genomic assays have been developed and applied to predict patient prognosis for personalized treatment. We hypothesize that the recurrence risk of ER+ breast cancer patients is determined by both genomic mutations intrinsic to tumor cells and extrinsic immunological features in the tumor microenvironment. Based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data, we identified the 72 most common genomic aberrations (including gene mutations and indels) in ER+ breast cancer and defined sample-specific scores that systematically characterized the deregulated pathways intrinsic to tumor cells. To further consider tumor cell extrinsic features, we calculated immune infiltration scores for six major immune cell types. Many individual intrinsic features are predictive of patient prognosis in ER+ breast cancer, and some of them achieved comparable accuracy with the Oncotype DX assay. In addition, statistical learning models that integrated these features predicts the recurrence risk of patients with significantly better performance than the Oncotype DX assay (our optimized random forest model AUC = 0.841, Oncotype DX model AUC = 0.792, p = 0.04). As a proof-of-concept, our study indicates the great potential of genomic and immunological features in prognostic prediction for improving breast cancer precision medicine. The framework introduced in this work can be readily applied to other cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thalamic bursts modulate cortical synchrony locally to switch between states of global functional connectivity in a cognitive task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oscar Portoles, Manuel Blesa, Marieke van Vugt, Ming Cao, Jelmer P. Borst</p>

Performing a cognitive task requires going through a sequence of functionally diverse stages. Although it is typically assumed that these stages are characterized by distinct states of cortical synchrony that are triggered by sub-cortical events, little reported evidence supports this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we first identified cognitive stages in single-trial MEG data of an associative recognition task, showing with a novel method that each stage begins with local modulations of synchrony followed by a state of directed functional connectivity. Second, we developed the first whole-brain model that can simulate cortical synchrony throughout a task. The model suggests that the observed synchrony is caused by thalamocortical bursts at the onset of each stage, targeted at cortical synapses and interacting with the structural anatomical connectivity. These findings confirm that cognitive stages are defined by distinct states of cortical synchrony and explains the network-level mechanisms necessary for reaching stage-dependent synchrony states.

                <p>by Yu Sang, Jie Ren, Alejandro Aballay</p>

Probiotics play a critical role in the control of host intestinal microbial balance, protecting the host from gastrointestinal pathogens, modulating the host immune response, and decreasing host susceptibility to infection. To understand the mechanism underlying the protective effect of probiotics against infections through immune regulation, we examined protection against <i>Salmonella enterica</i> infection following exposure to nonpathogenic <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We found that the transcription factor HLH-26, a REF-1 family member of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, was required in the intestine for <i>E</i>. <i>faecium–</i>mediated protection of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> against a lethal <i>S</i>. <i>enterica</i> infection. In addition, we uncovered that defense response genes controlled by the canonical Wnt/BAR-1 pathway were activated upon exposure to <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> in an HLH-26–dependent manner. Our findings highlight a role for REF-1/HLH-26 in the control of the Wnt/BAR-1 pathway in probiotic-mediated protection against gut infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of multiple bacterial species and antibiotic classes reveals large variation in the association between seasonal antibiotic use and resistance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daphne S. Sun, Stephen M. Kissler, Sanjat Kanjilal, Scott W. Olesen, Marc Lipsitch, Yonatan H. Grad</p>

Understanding how antibiotic use drives resistance is crucial for guiding effective strategies to limit the spread of resistance, but the use–resistance relationship across pathogens and antibiotics remains unclear. We applied sinusoidal models to evaluate the seasonal use–resistance relationship across 3 species (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>) and 5 antibiotic classes (penicillins, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and nitrofurans) in Boston, Massachusetts. Outpatient use of all 5 classes and resistance in inpatient and outpatient isolates in 9 of 15 species–antibiotic combinations showed statistically significant amplitudes of seasonality (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). While seasonal peaks in use varied by class, resistance in all 9 species–antibiotic combinations peaked in the winter and spring. The correlations between seasonal use and resistance thus varied widely, with resistance to all antibiotic classes being most positively correlated with use of the winter peaking classes (penicillins and macrolides). These findings challenge the simple model of antibiotic use independently selecting for resistance and suggest that stewardship strategies will not be equally effective across all species and antibiotics. Rather, seasonal selection for resistance across multiple antibiotic classes may be dominated by use of the most highly prescribed antibiotic classes, penicillins and macrolides.

Neurodegenerative disorders refer to a group of diseases commonly associated with abnormal protein accumulation and aggregation in the central nervous system. However, the exact role of protein aggregation in the pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. This gap in knowledge is due to the lack of experimental models that allow for the spatiotemporal control of protein aggregation, and the investigation of early dynamic events associated with inclusion formation. Here, we report on the development of a light-inducible protein aggregation (LIPA) system that enables spatiotemporal control of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation into insoluble deposits called Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD) and other proteinopathies. We demonstrate that LIPA-α-syn inclusions mimic key biochemical, biophysical, and ultrastructural features of authentic LBs observed in PD-diseased brains. In vivo, LIPA-α-syn aggregates compromise nigrostriatal transmission, induce neurodegeneration and PD-like motor impairments. Collectively, our findings provide a new tool for the generation, visualization, and dissection of the role of α-syn aggregation in PD.

                Aim: This study aims to build the capacity of the people at grass root level as gatekeepers of mental health. It will assess the effectiveness of the Gatekeeper Training Program (GTP) on gatekeeper behaviour, awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention. Design: An evaluative research approach in two phases. Phase 1: Cross-sectional house-to-house exploratory survey. Phase 2: A quasi-experimental design with multiple follow ups at 0, 6 and 12 months. Method: Data will be collected using standardized tools like Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ), Community Attitude towards Mentally Ill (CAMIS), Mental Help Seeking Intention (MHSIS) and Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (GBS). For Phase 1, a house-to-house survey will be conducted among the selected colonies of Koraga tribe to determine their awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention regarding common mental health problems. Phase 2 includes identification of the leaders/representatives of the selected tribal colonies, and involving them in GTP. Pre-test and multiple post-test will be conducted in Phase 2 at 0, 6, 12 months.  The study is funded by Indian Council of Medical Research from 16 August 2021 for 3 years duration. Discussion: Treatment gap in psychiatric disorders remains an issue of great concern. Evidence based research promotes task shifting approaches in dealing with mental health problems in the community. Capacity building programs like GTP for the underprivileged section of the society are important especially in low and middle income group of countries. Impact: This need based GTP, will ensure mental health first aid in the society. Early identification of people with mental health problems at their doorsteps has huge impact on the prognosis of the illness, closing the treatment gap and stigma reduction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Promising sequels of a novel nanoformulation of khamira abresham hakim Arshadwala against isoprenaline challenged cardiac damage in rodents [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Khamira Abresham Hakim Arshadwala (KAHAW), a distinguished, traditional Unani formulation comprising constituents of herbal, animal, and mineral origin, holds salubrious cardioprotective potential and has been used for cardiac ailments in the Unani system for ages. KAHAW is a ‘sugar-based’ preparation, which hinders its ‘claim to fame’ amongst cardiac patients with diabetes. Hence, it is fascinating to develop a novel nanoformulation of the traditional one and screen its efficacy experimentally on the male Wistar rats (4-week-old) (150-180gm). The objective was to revolutionize this historic gem of a formulation and enhance its therapeutic efficacy, a novel nanoformulation of KAHAW was developed, and its cardioprotective potential screened against isoprenaline (ISO) induced cardiotoxicity in rodents. The results were analyzed with the traditional formulations and two clinically used drugs, Ramipril and Carvedilol. Methods: Various parameters viz; Physical, Enzymatic, Non-enzymatic, and cardiac-specific biomarkers like α/β-MHC expression (Western Blot), Flow cytometry, Cardiac collagen content, and Mitochondrial enzyme assay were assessed on plasma, blood, and tissue samples followed by histomorphological investigations. Results: The effect of nanoformulation showed highly significant results (***p<0.001) when compared to disease control for different parameters viz, Total protein, GPx and GSH, Lipid peroxidation, and Vitamin E. The cardiac-specific biomarkers like α/β-MHC Expression (Western Blot), Flow Cytometry, Cardiac collagen content, and Mitochondrial enzyme assay also advocated the highly significant (***p<0.001) cardioprotective activity of the developed nanoformulation. Conclusions: The research reiterates that the novel nanoformulation offers improved efficacy at a reduced dose against ISO-induced experimental models of myocardial necrosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-angiogenic effect of the combination low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Sorafenib is an expensive standard drug used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin gallate leads to a reduced cost but equally effective anti-angiogenic effect. Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate. Methods:  A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7-weeks-old) were randomly divided into 4 groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) intraperitoneally for 10 weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for 2 weeks. Subsequently, the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and expression of microvascular density was examined using liver tissues. Results: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in the level of VEGF between the group X1 (106,682 ± 41,024) and X2 (214,5162 ± 67,71652). However, the differences in VEGF level of group X1 and X2 compared to group O (318,101 ± 55,078) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of microvascular density between groups X1 (36 ± 4,416) and X2 (26,2 ± 4,55) was not significantly different. Meanwhile, a significant difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared with group O (176 ± 19). Conclusion: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib as well as the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity to reduce the expression of microvascular density.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Framing and understanding the whole aspect of oral sex from social and health perspective: a narrative review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Since thousands of years ago, oral sex has become part of sexual behavior among humans. Oral sex is considered taboo. Its taboo does not lie in the behavior, but its expression is deemed inappropriate. As technology becomes more sophisticated, human rights also stand out, leading to the disclosure of the practice in the 21st century. The oral sex that is discussed on a large scale in media encourages people to express it as feedback whether within right or not. It all depends on the value of each people. We found that this sexual behavior is found everywhere regardless of religion, culture, and race. Pop culture influences this behavior so much, it can be seen from music, movies, and television programs that provoke oral sex. Many motivations underlying this behavior include getting sexual pleasure for the sake of psychological well-being. But it is undeniable that this behavior is still controversial. It could be at risk of causing disease and, on the other hand, is reported to provide many benefits. According to our theory, oral sex is not a new behavior crossing boundaries. It is just an old behavior that surfaces because of the factors that support it. This behavior, which is still considered taboo, has its disadvantages such as sexually transmitted disease and oral cancer but has also benefits such as preventing preeclampsia.

                We evaluated neuropathological consequences of fetal ZIKV exposure in rhesus monkeys, a translatable animal model for human neural development, by carrying out quantitative neuroanatomical analyses of the nearly full-term brains of fetuses infected with ZIKV and procedure-matched controls. For each animal, a complete cerebral hemisphere was evaluated using immunohistochemical (IHC) and neuroanatomical techniques to detect virus, identify affected cell types, and evaluate gross neuroanatomical abnormalities. IHC staining revealed the presence of ZIKV in the frontal lobe, which contained activated microglia and showed increased apoptosis of immature neurons. ZIKV-infected animals exhibited macrostructural changes within the visual pathway. Regional differences tracked with the developmental timing of the brain, suggesting inflammatory processes related to viral infiltration swept through the cortex, followed by a wave of cell death resulting in morphological changes. These findings may help explain why some infants born with normal sized heads during the ZIKV epidemic manifest developmental challenges as they age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ecdysone coordinates plastic growth with robust pattern in the developing wing</a></h4>

              
                Animals develop in unpredictable, variable environments. In response to environmental change some aspects of development adjust to generate plastic phenotypes. Other aspects of development, however, are buffered against environmental change to produce robust phenotypes. How organ development is coordinated to accommodate both plastic and robust developmental responses is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates both plasticity of organ size and robustness of organ pattern in the developing wings of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Using fed and starved larvae that lack prothoracic glands, which synthesise ecdysone, we show that nutrition regulates growth both via ecdysone and via an ecdysone-independent mechanism, while nutrition regulates patterning only via ecdysone. We then demonstrate that growth shows a graded response to ecdysone concentration, while patterning shows a threshold response. Collectively, these data support a model where nutritionally-regulated ecdysone fluctuations confer plasticity by regulating disc growth in response to basal ecdysone levels, and confers robustness by initiating patterning only once ecdysone peaks exceeds a threshold concentration. This could represent a generalizable mechanism through which hormones coordinate plastic growth with robust patterning in the face of environmental change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">First-order visual interneurons distribute distinct contrast and luminance information across ON and OFF pathways to achieve stable behavior</a></h4>

              
                The accurate processing of contrast is the basis for all visually guided behaviors. Visual scenes with rapidly changing illumination challenge contrast computation because photoreceptor adaptation is not fast enough to compensate for such changes. Yet, human perception of contrast is stable even when the visual environment is quickly changing, suggesting rapid post receptor luminance gain control. Similarly, in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, such gain control leads to luminance invariant behavior for moving OFF stimuli. Here we show that behavioral responses to moving ON stimuli also utilize a luminance gain, and that ON-motion guided behavior depends on inputs from three first-order interneurons L1, L2 and L3. Each of these neurons encodes contrast and luminance differently and distributes information asymmetrically across both ON and OFF contrast-selective pathways. Behavioral responses to both ON and OFF stimuli rely on a luminance-based correction provided by L1 and L3, wherein L1 supports contrast computation linearly, and L3 non-linearly amplifies dim stimuli. Therefore, L1, L2 and L3 are not specific inputs to ON and OFF pathways but the lamina serves as a separate processing layer that distributes distinct luminance and contrast information across ON and OFF pathways to support behavior in varying conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SLC38A2 provides proline to fulfil unique synthetic demands arising during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation</a></h4>

              
                Cellular differentiation is associated with the acquisition of a unique protein signature which is essential to attain the ultimate cellular function and activity of the differentiated cell. This is predicted to result in unique biosynthetic demands that arise during differentiation. Using a bioinformatic approach, we discovered osteoblast differentiation is associated with increased demand for the amino acid proline. When compared to other differentiated cells, osteoblast-associated proteins including RUNX2, OSX, OCN and COL1A1 are significantly enriched in proline. Using a genetic and metabolomic approach, we demonstrate that the neutral amino acid transporter SLC38A2 acts cell autonomously to provide proline to facilitate the efficient synthesis of proline-rich osteoblast proteins. Genetic ablation of SLC38A2 in osteoblasts limits both osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in mice. Mechanistically, proline is primarily incorporated into nascent protein with little metabolism observed. Collectively, these data highlight a requirement for proline in fulfilling the unique biosynthetic requirements that arise during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pum2 and TDP-43 refine area-specific cytoarchitecture post-mitotically and modulate translation of Sox5, Bcl11b, and Rorb mRNAs in developing mouse neocortex</a></h4>

              
                In the neocortex, functionally distinct areas process specific types of information. Area identity is established by morphogens and transcriptional master regulators, but downstream mechanisms driving area-specific neuronal specification remain unclear. Here, we reveal a role for RNA-binding proteins in defining area-specific cytoarchitecture. Mice lacking Pum2 or overexpressing human TDP-43 show apparent ‘motorization’ of layers IV and V of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), characterized by dramatic expansion of cells co-expressing Sox5 and Bcl11b/Ctip2, a hallmark of subcerebral projection neurons, at the expense of cells expressing the layer IV neuronal marker Rorβ. Moreover, retrograde labeling experiments with cholera toxin B in <i>Pum2; Emx1-Cre</i> and TDP43<sup>A315T</sup> mice revealed a corresponding increase in subcerebral connectivity of these neurons in S1. Intriguingly, other key features of somatosensory area identity are largely preserved, suggesting that Pum2 and TDP-43 may function in a downstream program, rather than controlling area identity per se. Transfection of primary neurons and in utero electroporation (IUE) suggest cell-autonomous and post-mitotic modulation of Sox5, Bcl11b/Ctip2, and Rorβ levels. Mechanistically, we find that Pum2 and TDP-43 directly interact with and affect the translation of mRNAs encoding Sox5, Bcl11b/Ctip2, and Rorβ. In contrast, effects on the levels of these mRNAs were not detectable in qRT-PCR or single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, and we also did not detect effects on their splicing or polyadenylation patterns. Our results support the notion that post-transcriptional regulatory programs involving translational regulation and mediated by Pum2 and TDP-43 contribute to elaboration of area-specific neuronal identity and connectivity in the neocortex.

                Early-life exposure to anesthesia in infant humans and monkeys increases the risk for cognitive and socioemotional impairments. However, the long-term effects of neonatal anesthesia on synaptic ultrastructure have not been thoroughly investigated in primates. We used electron microscopy with unbiased stereological sampling to assess synaptic ultrastructure in the CA1 of the hippocampus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of female and male rhesus macaques four years after three 4-hour exposures to sevoflurane during the first five postnatal weeks. We counted synapses and measured synapse areas for all synapses and those classified as perforated or nonperforated with spine or dendritic shaft targets. We measured numbers and shapes of mitochondria within presynaptic boutons and calculated vesicle docking rates. In monkeys exposed to anesthesia as infants, synapse areas were reduced in the largest 20% of synapses in CA1 and the largest 5% of synapses in dlPFC, with differential sex effects for the largest 10% of synapses in CA1. Synapse areas were reduced by 7.6% for perforated spinous synapses in CA1, and by 10.4% for nonperforated spinous synapses in dlPFC. Perforated and nonperforated dendritic synapse numbers in CA1 increased by 180% and 63% respectively. Curved mitochondria decreased 25% in CA1 after anesthesia exposure, and dlPFC boutons with 0 mitochondria showed an interaction of anesthesia and sex. These results demonstrate that exposure to anesthesia in infancy can cause long-term structural deficits in primates. These structural changes may be substrates for long-term alterations in the strength and efficiency of synaptic transmission in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal gamma and sharp wave/ripples mediate bidirectional interactions with cortical networks during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampus-neocortex interactions during sleep are critical for memory processes: hippocampally-initiated replay contributes to memory consolidation in the neocortex and hippocampal sharp wave/ripples are linked to generalized increases in neocortical cell activity and DOWN-UP state transitions. Yet, the spatial and temporal patterns of this exchange are unknown. With voltage imaging, electrocorticography, and laminarly-resolved hippocampal potentials, we characterized cortico-hippocampal interactions during anesthesia and NREM sleep. We observed neocortical activation transients spanning multiple spatial scales hinting at a quasi-critical regime. Transients were organized in a small number of functional networks matching known anatomical connectivity. A network overlapping with the default mode network and centered on retrosplenial cortex was the most associated with the hippocampus. Interestingly, hippocampal slow gamma was the oscillation that best correlated with this neocortical network, outpacing ripples. In fact, neocortical activity predicted hippocampal slow gamma and followed ripples, suggesting that consolidation processes rely on bi-directional exchanges between hippocampus and neocortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not optimal, just noisy: the geometry of correlated variability leads to highly suboptimal sensory coding</a></h4>

              
                The brain represents the world through the activity of neural populations. Correlated variability across simultaneously recorded neurons (noise correlations) has been observed across cortical areas and experimental paradigms. Many studies have shown that correlated variability improves stimulus coding compared to a null model with no correlations. However, such results do not shed light on whether neural populations' correlated variability achieves optimal coding. Here, we assess optimality of noise correlations in diverse datasets by developing two novel null models each with a unique biological interpretation: a uniform correlations null model and a factor analysis null model. We show that across datasets, the correlated variability in neural populations leads to highly suboptimal coding performance according to these null models. We demonstrate that biological constraints prevent many subsets of the neural populations from achieving optimality according to these null models, and that subselecting based on biological criteria leaves coding performance suboptimal. Finally, we show that the optimal subpopulation is exponentially small as a function of neural dimensionality. Together, these results show that the geometry of correlated variability leads to highly suboptimal sensory coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Repeat Detector: accurate, efficient, and flexible sizing of expanded CAG/CTG repeats from targeted DNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Targeted DNA sequencing approaches will improve how the size of short tandem repeats is measured for diagnostic tests and pre-clinical studies. The expansion of these sequences causes dozens of disorders, with longer tracts generally leading to a more severe disease. In addition, interruptions are sometimes present within repeats and can alter disease manifestation. Despite advances in methodologies, determining repeat size and identifying interruptions in targeted sequencing datasets remains a major challenge. This is because standard alignment tools are ill-suited for the repetitive nature of these sequences. To address this, we have developed Repeat Detector (RD), a deterministic profile weighting algorithm for counting repeats in targeted sequencing data. We tested RD using blood-derived DNA samples from Huntington's disease (HD) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy patients sequenced using either Illumina MiSeq or Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real-time sequencing platforms. RD was highly accurate in determining repeat sizes of 609 HD blood-derived samples and did not require prior knowledge of the flanking sequences or their polymorphisms within the patient population. We demonstrate that RD can be used to identify individuals with repeat interruptions and may provide a measure of repeat instability within an individual. RD is therefore highly versatile and may find applications in the diagnosis of expanded repeat disorders and the development of novel therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">miR-329 and miR-495-mediated Prr7 downregulation isrequired for homeostatic synaptic depression in rathippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic depression (HSD) in excitatory neurons is a cell autonomous mechanism which protects excitatory neurons from over-excitation as a consequence of chronic increases in network activity. In this process, excitatory synapses are weakened and eventually eliminated, as evidenced by a reduction in synaptic AMPA receptor expression and dendritic spine loss. Originally considered a global, cell-wide mechanism, local forms of regulation, such as the local control of mRNA translation in dendrites, are being increasingly recognized in HSD. Yet, identification of excitatory proteins whose local regulation is required for HSD is still limited. Here, we show that Proline-rich protein 7/Transmembrane Adapter Protein 3 (Prr7) downregulation in dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons is necessary for HSD induced by chronic increase in network activity resulting from a blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission by picrotoxin (PTX). We further identify two activity-regulated miRNAs, miR-329-3p and miR-495-3p, which inhibit Prr7 mRNA translation and are required for HSD. Moreover, we found that Prr7 knockdown reduces expression of the synaptic scaffolding protein SPAR, which is rescued by pharmacological inhibition of CDK5, indicating a role of Prr7 protein in the maintenance of excitatory synapses via protection of SPAR from degradation. Together, our findings highlight a novel HSD mechanism in which chronic activity leads to miR-329 and miR- 495-mediated local Prr7 reduction upstream of the CDK5-SPAR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lag-optimized BOLD cerebrovascular reactivity derived from breathing task data has a stronger relationship with baseline cerebral blood flow</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is an important indicator of cerebrovascular health and is commonly studied with the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) response to a vasoactive stimulus. There is theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) modulates the BOLD signal amplitude, and that baseline CBF may influence BOLD-CVR estimates. We address how some pertinent data acquisition and modelling choices affect the relationship between baseline CBF and BOLD-CVR: whether BOLD-CVR is modelled with breathing task data or just resting-state data, and whether BOLD-CVR amplitudes are optimized for hemodynamic lag effects. For the relationship between baseline CBF and BOLD-CVR, we assessed both between-subject correlations of average GM values and within-subject spatial correlations across cortical regions. Our results suggest that a simple breathing task addition to a resting-state scan, alongside lag-optimization within BOLD-CVR modelling, can improve BOLD-CVR correlations with baseline CBF, both between- and within-subjects, likely because these CVR estimates are more physiologically accurate. We report positive coupling between baseline CBF and BOLD-CVR, both between and within subjects; the physiological explanation of this positive coupling is unclear, and future research with larger sample sizes and more tightly controlled vasoactive stimuli is needed. Understanding how baseline vascular physiology relates to dynamic cerebrovascular processes will bring further insights into what drives between and within subject participant variability in BOLD-CVR measurements and related measurements of cerebrovascular function. These insights are particularly relevant when interpreting results in populations with altered vascular and/or metabolic baselines or impaired cerebrovascular reserve.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Necessity and recruitment of cue-specific neuronal ensembles within the basolateral amygdala during appetitive reversal learning</a></h4>

              
                Through Pavlovian appetitive conditioning, environmental cues can become predictors of food availability. Over time, however, the food, and thus the value of the associated cues, can change based on environmental variations. This change in outcome necessitates updating of the value of the cue to appropriately alter behavioral responses to these cues. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical in updating the outcomes of learned cues. However, it is unknown if the same BLA neuronal ensembles that are recruited in the initial associative memory are required when the new cue-outcome association is formed during reversal learning. The current study used the Daun02 inactivation method that enables selective targeting and disruption of activated neuronal ensembles in Fos-lacZ transgenic rats. Rats were implanted with bilateral cannulas that target the BLA and underwent appetitive discriminative conditioning in which rats had to discriminate between two auditory stimuli. One stimulus (CS+) co-terminated with food delivery, and the other stimulus was unrewarded (CS-; counterbalanced). Rats were then tested for CS+ or CS- memory retrieval and infused with either Daun02 or a vehicle solution into the BLA to inactivate either CS+ or CS- neuronal ensembles that were activated during that test. To assess if the same neuronal ensembles are necessary to update the value of the new association when the outcomes are changed, rats underwent reversal learning: the CS+ was no longer followed by food (reversal CS-, rCS-), and the CS- was now followed by food (reversal CS+; rCS+). The group that received Daun02 following CS+ session showed a decrease in conditioned responding and increased latency to the rCS- (previously CS+) during the first session of reversal learning, specifically during the first trial. This indicates that neuronal ensembles that are activated during the recall of the CS+ memory are the same neuronal ensembles needed for learning the new outcome of the same CS, now rCS-. Additionally, the group that received Daun02 following CS- session was slower to respond to the rCS+ (previously CS-) during reversal learning. This indicates that neuronal ensembles that are activated during the recall of the CS- memory are the same neuronal ensembles needed for learning the new outcome of the same CS. These results demonstrate that different neuronal ensembles within the BLA mediate memory recall of CS+ and CS- cues and reactivation of each cue-specific neuronal ensemble is necessary to update the value of that specific cue to respond appropriately during reversal learning. These results also indicate substantial plasticity within the BLA for behavioral flexibility as both groups eventually showed similar terminal levels of reversal learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social closeness modulates brain dynamics during distrust anticipation</a></h4>

              
                Anticipation of trust from a partner with high social closeness generates the preconditions for cooperative and reciprocal interactions to occur. However, if there is uncertainty in the interaction because the partner is a stranger or because the person has mistrusted us on another occasion, an aversive experience is generated. Hence, low social closeness or mistrust makes people keep track of the other's behavior. In case of experiencing deviations from social norms, the person will monitor the intentions of the partner and update their priors regarding their social preferences. The anterior insula (AIns) seems to be sensitive to these social norm violations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, however, the monitoring of partners with different levels of social closeness has not been investigated. In our study, we wanted to find the brain regions related to (dis)trust anticipation from partners who differ in their level of social closeness. For this, we designed an experiment in which participants played an economic decision game with three people (trustors): A computer, a stranger, and a real friend. We covertly manipulated their decisions in the game so that they unexpectedly distrusted our participants. Using task-fMRI, our whole-brain analysis found that the AIns was active during the anticipation of the decisions from human partners (humans vs computer), but not during anticipation between high and low social closeness (friend vs stranger). However, using a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we found increases in functional coupling between the AIns and regions in the "mentalizing" network (such as temporal regions and parieto-occipital cortices) during trust anticipation between a high versus low social closeness partner. These results suggest that there may be a modulation of the AIns activity, specifically for high social closeness trustors, by regions that encode the intentions underlying the truster behavior.

	<p>Mindfulness training (MT) reduces self-referential processing and promotes interoception, the perception of sensations from inside the body, by increasing one’s awareness of and regulating responses to them. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the insular cortex (INS) are considered hubs for self-referential processing and interoception, respectively. Although MT has been consistently found to decrease PCC, little is known about how MT relates to INS activity. Understanding links between mindfulness and interoception may be particularly important for informing mental health in adolescence, when neuroplasticity and emergence of psychopathology are heightened. We examined INS activity during real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback-augmented mindfulness training (NAMT) targeting the PCC. Healthy adolescents (N = 37; 16 female) completed the NAMT task, including Focus-on-Breath (MT), Describe (self-referential processing), and Rest conditions, across three neurofeedback runs and two non-neurofeedback runs (Observe, Transfer). Regression coefficients estimated from the generalized linear model were extracted from three INS subregions: anterior (aINS), mid (mINS), and posterior (pINS). Mixed model analyses revealed the main effect of run for Focus-on-Breath vs. Describe contrast in aINS [R2 = 0.39] and pINS [R2 = 0.33], but not mINS [R2 = 0.34]. Post hoc analyses revealed greater aINS activity and reduced pINS activity during neurofeedback runs, and such activities were related to lower self-reported life satisfaction and less pain behavior, respectively. These findings revealed the specific involvement of insula subregions in rtfMRI-nf MT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Mediodorsal Thalamus Is Critical for Updating during Extradimensional Shifts But Not Reversals in the Attentional Set-Shifting Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cognitive flexibility, attributed to frontal cortex, is vital for navigating the complexities of everyday life. The mediodorsal thalamus (MD), interconnected to frontal cortex, may influence cognitive flexibility. Here, male rats performed an attentional set-shifting task measuring intradimensional (ID) and extradimensional (ED) shifts in sensory discriminations. MD lesion rats needed more trials to learn the rewarded sensory dimension. However, once the choice response strategy was established, learning further two-choice discriminations in the same sensory dimension, and reversals of the reward contingencies in the same dimension, were unimpaired. Critically though, MD lesion rats were impaired during the ED shift, when they must rapidly update the optimal choice response strategy. Behavioral analyses showed MD lesion rats had significantly reduced correct within-trial second choice responses. This evidence shows that transfer of information via the MD is critical when rapid within-trial updates in established choice response strategies are required after a rule change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Heterozygous Dcc Mutant Mice Have a Subtle Locomotor Phenotype</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Axon guidance receptors such as deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) contribute to the normal formation of neural circuits, and their mutations can be associated with neural defects. In humans, heterozygous mutations in <I>DCC</I> have been linked to congenital mirror movements, which are involuntary movements on one side of the body that mirror voluntary movements of the opposite side. In mice, obvious hopping phenotypes have been reported for bi-allelic <I>Dcc</I> mutations, while heterozygous mutants have not been closely examined. We hypothesized that a detailed characterization of <I>Dcc</I> heterozygous mice may reveal impaired corticospinal and spinal functions. Anterograde tracing of the <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> motor cortex revealed a normally projecting corticospinal tract, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) evoked normal contralateral motor responses, and behavioral tests showed normal skilled forelimb coordination. Gait analyses also showed a normal locomotor pattern and rhythm in adult <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice during treadmill locomotion, except for a decreased occurrence of out-of-phase walk and an increased duty cycle of the stance phase at slow walking speed. Neonatal isolated <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> spinal cords had normal left-right and flexor-extensor coupling, along with normal locomotor pattern and rhythm, except for an increase in the flexor-related motoneuronal output. Although <I>Dcc</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice do not exhibit any obvious bilateral impairments like those in humans, they exhibit subtle motor deficits during neonatal and adult locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Binding Impairments in Visual Working Memory following Temporal Lobectomy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Disorders of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) adversely affect visual working memory (vWM) performance, including feature binding. It is unclear whether these impairments generalize across visual dimensions or are specifically spatial. To address this issue, we compared performance in two tasks of 13 epilepsy patients, who had undergone a temporal lobectomy, and 15 healthy controls. In the vWM task, participants recalled the color of one of two polygons, previously displayed side by side. At recall, a location or shape probe identified the target. In the perceptual task, participants estimated the centroid of three visible disks. Patients recalled the target color less accurately than healthy controls because they frequently swapped the nontarget with the target color. Moreover, healthy controls and right temporal lobectomy patients made more swap errors following shape than space probes. Left temporal lobectomy patients, showed the opposite pattern of errors instead. Patients and controls performed similarly in the perceptual task. We conclude that left MTL damage impairs spatial binding in vWM, and that this impairment does not reflect a perceptual or attentional deficit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence for yeast artificial synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 genomic sequences [version 4; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast DNA origin covering the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a passage model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that among SARS-like coronaviruses only the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain information that points to a synthetic passage in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

                Background: Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induces physiological and morphological photoaging of the skin resulting in wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. This study analyzed nanoencapsulation of a gel combination of Centella asiatica (CA) transfersomes and rosemary essential oil (REO) nanoemulsion with lipid-based nanocarriers for the ability of both biological compounds to synergistically prevent UVB radiation, along with ameliorative and anti-aging effects. Methods: To ensure the quality, lipid-based nanocarriers of transfersomes and nanoemulsion were characterized based on physicochemical properties such as particle size distribution, polydispersity index, zeta potential. In vivo studies were used to determine the biological effects of a gel combination of CA transfersomes, and REO nanoemulsion applied topically two weeks before UVB radiation (840 mJ/cm2) in BALB/c hairless mice. Results: Results showed that the optimum lipid-based nanocarriers had a particle size of 43.97 ± 5.6 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.64 ± 0.01, and a zeta potential of -10.91 ± 1.99 mV. In vivo experiments revealed that topical application of a gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion significantly ameliorated wrinkle formation, epidermal hyperplasia, and collagen fiber arrangement caused by UVB exposure. Further, the gel combining CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion suppressed lipid peroxidation by decreasing the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA) and collagen destruction by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. Moreover, the gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion upregulated type I collagen through activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad pathway, thereby recovering the density of collagen fiber reduced by UVB radiation. Conclusions: Overall, these data indicate that topical application of a gel combination of CA transfersomes and REO nanoemulsion could act synergistically and potentially prevents oxidative stress and collagen degradation in the skin from UVB-induced photoaging.

                Background: Shoulder biomechanics cannot be measured directly in living persons. While different glenohumeral joint simulators have been developed to investigate the role of the glenohumeral muscles in shoulder biomechanics, a standard for these simulators has not been defined. With this scoping review we want to describe available ex-vivo experimental strategies for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics. Objective: The scoping review aims at identifying methodological and/or experimental studies describing or involving ex-vivo simulators that assess unconstrained shoulder biomechanics and synthesizing their strengths and limitations. Inclusion criteria: All unconstrained glenohumeral joint simulators published in connection with ex-vivo or mechanical simulation experiments will be included. Studies on glenohumeral simulators with active components to mimic the muscles will be included. We will exclude studies where the experiment is static or the motion is induced through an external guide, e.g., a robotic device. Methods: We will perform database searching in PubMed, Embase via Elsevier and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently assess full texts of selected abstracts. Direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles will be conducted. We will narratively synthesize the results and derive recommendations for designing ex-vivo simulators for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics.

                Background: Altmetrics measure the impact of journal articles by tracking social media, Wikipedia, public policy documents, blogs, and mainstream news activity, after which an overall Altmetric attention score (AAS) is calculated for every journal article. In this study, we aim to assess the AAS for influenza related articles and its relation to the influenza season in the USA. Methods: This study used the openly available Altmetric data from Altmetric.com. First, we retrieved all influenza-related articles using an advanced PubMed search query, then we inputted the resulted query into Altmetric explorer. We then calculated the average AAS for each month during the years 2012-2018. Results: A total of 24,964 PubMed documents were extracted, among them, 12,395 documents had at least one attention. We found a significant difference in mean AAS between February and each of January and March (p< 0.001, mean difference of 117.4 and 460.7, respectively). We found a significant difference between June and each of May and July (p< 0.001, mean difference of 1221.4 and 162.7, respectively). We also found a significant difference between October and each of September and November (p< 0.001, mean difference of 88.8 and 154.8, respectively). Conclusion: We observed a seasonal trend in the attention toward influenza-related research, with three annual peaks that correlated with the beginning, peak, and end of influenza seasons in the USA, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a great burden on governments and the medical fraternity globally. Many clinical studies from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA); AYUSH research portal; Google scholar and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Data will be synthesized, with RevMan 5.4 tool and the risk of bias will be assessed with RoB 2 (for RCTs) and ROBINS I (for NRSIs). Certainty of evidence will be assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates. Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19. It will facilitate professionals, guideline developers, and authorities with up to date synthesis on interventions periodically to make health-care decisions on AYUSH therapies in the management of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients: a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations</a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The need to reassess single-cell RNA sequencing datasets: the importance of biological sample processing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer relevant conclusions about the underlying biology of the dataset. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses. Methods: We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm. Results: Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions. Conclusions: We postulate that careful design of experimental conditions is needed to avoid long processing times of biological samples. Additionally, computation of large datasets might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long processing times.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">RGMa Signal in Macrophages Induces Neutrophil‐Related Astrocytopathy in NMO</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein which has multiple functions including axon growth inhibition and immune regulation. However, its role in the pathophysiology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is poorly understood. Perivascular astrocytopathy, which is induced by the leakage of aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific IgG into the central nervous system parenchyma, is a key feature of NMO pathology. We investigated the RGMa involvement in the pathology of NMO astrocytopathy, and tested a therapeutic potential of humanized anti-RGMa monoclonal antibody (RGMa-mAb).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a clinically relevant NMO rat model, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a RGMa-mAb by behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression assay. We further performed in vitro experiments to address the RGMa-signaling in macrophages.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In both NMO rats and an NMO-autopsied sample, RGMa was expressed by the spared neurons and astrocytes, whereas its receptor neogenin was expressed by infiltrating macrophages. AQP4-IgG-induced astrocytopathy and clinical exacerbation in NMO rats were ameliorated by RGMa-mAb treatment. RGMa-mAb treatment significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration, and decreased the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Interestingly, neogenin-expressing macrophages accumulated in the lesion expressed CXCL2, a strong neutrophil chemoattractant, and further analysis revealed that RGMa directly regulated CXCL2 expression in macrophages. Finally, we found that our NMO rats developed neuropathic pain, and RGMa-mAb treatment effectively ameliorated the severity of neuropathic pain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RGMa signaling in infiltrated macrophages is a critical driver of neutrophil-related astrocytopathy in NMO lesions, and RGMa-mAb may provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for NMO-associated neuropathic pain and motor deficits in patients with NMO. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive mouse microbiota genome catalog reveals major difference to its human counterpart</a></h4>

Mouse is the most used model for studying the impact of microbiota on its host, but the repertoire of species from the mouse gut microbiome remains largely unknown. Accordingly, the similarity between human and mouse microbiomes at a low taxonomic level is not clear. We construct a comprehensive mouse microbiota genome (CMMG) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 41’798 genomes cluster into 1’573 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, seven new families, and one new order. CMMG enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 86%, increases the mapping rate over four-fold, and allows functional microbiota analyses of human and mouse linking them to the driver species. Comparing CMMG to microbiota from the unified human gastrointestinal genomes shows an overlap of 62% at the genus but only 10% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct. CMMG contains the most comprehensive collection of consistently functionally annotated species of the mouse and human microbiome to date, setting the ground for the analysis of new and reanalysis of existing datasets at an unprecedented depth.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A bio-mimetic miniature drone for real-time audio based short-range tracking</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roei Zigelman, Ofri Eitan, Omer Mazar, Anthony Weiss, Yossi Yovel</p>

One of the most difficult sensorimotor behaviors exhibited by flying animals is the ability to track another flying animal based on its sound emissions. From insects to mammals, animals display this ability in order to localize and track conspecifics, mate or prey. The pursuing individual must overcome multiple non-trivial challenges including the detection of the sounds emitted by the target, matching the input received by its (mostly) two sensors, localizing the direction of the sound target in real time and then pursuing it. All this has to be done rapidly as the target is constantly moving. In this project, we set to mimic this ability using a physical bio-mimetic autonomous drone. We equipped a miniature commercial drone with our in-house 2D sound localization electronic circuit which uses two microphones (mimicking biological ears) to localize sound signals in real-time and steer the drone in the horizontal plane accordingly. We focus on bat signals because bats are known to eavesdrop on conspecifics and follow them, but our approach could be generalized to other biological signals and other man-made signals. Using two different experiments, we show that our fully autonomous aviator can track the position of a moving sound emitting target and pursue it in real-time. Building an actual robotic-agent, forced us to deal with real-life difficulties which also challenge animals. We thus discuss the similarities and differences between our and the biological approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simple model for encoding natural images by retinal ganglion cells with nonlinear spatial integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jian K. Liu, Dimokratis Karamanlis, Tim Gollisch</p>

A central goal in sensory neuroscience is to understand the neuronal signal processing involved in the encoding of natural stimuli. A critical step towards this goal is the development of successful computational encoding models. For ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina, the development of satisfactory models for responses to natural visual scenes is an ongoing challenge. Standard models typically apply linear integration of visual stimuli over space, yet many ganglion cells are known to show nonlinear spatial integration, in particular when stimulated with contrast-reversing gratings. We here study the influence of spatial nonlinearities in the encoding of natural images by ganglion cells, using multielectrode-array recordings from isolated salamander and mouse retinas. We assess how responses to natural images depend on first- and second-order statistics of spatial patterns inside the receptive field. This leads us to a simple extension of current standard ganglion cell models. We show that taking not only the weighted average of light intensity inside the receptive field into account but also its variance over space can partly account for nonlinear integration and substantially improve response predictions of responses to novel images. For salamander ganglion cells, we find that response predictions for cell classes with large receptive fields profit most from including spatial contrast information. Finally, we demonstrate how this model framework can be used to assess the spatial scale of nonlinear integration. Our results underscore that nonlinear spatial stimulus integration translates to stimulation with natural images. Furthermore, the introduced model framework provides a simple, yet powerful extension of standard models and may serve as a benchmark for the development of more detailed models of the nonlinear structure of receptive fields.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Task-induced neural covariability as a signature of approximate Bayesian learning and inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard D. Lange, Ralf M. Haefner</p>

Perception is often characterized computationally as an inference process in which uncertain or ambiguous sensory inputs are combined with prior expectations. Although behavioral studies have shown that observers can change their prior expectations in the context of a task, robust neural signatures of task-specific priors have been elusive. Here, we analytically derive such signatures under the general assumption that the responses of sensory neurons encode posterior beliefs that combine sensory inputs with task-specific expectations. Specifically, we derive predictions for the task-dependence of correlated neural variability and decision-related signals in sensory neurons. The qualitative aspects of our results are parameter-free and specific to the statistics of each task. The predictions for correlated variability also differ from predictions of classic feedforward models of sensory processing and are therefore a strong test of theories of hierarchical Bayesian inference in the brain. Importantly, we find that Bayesian learning predicts an increase in so-called “differential correlations” as the observer’s internal model learns the stimulus distribution, and the observer’s behavioral performance improves. This stands in contrast to classic feedforward encoding/decoding models of sensory processing, since such correlations are fundamentally information-limiting. We find support for our predictions in data from existing neurophysiological studies across a variety of tasks and brain areas. Finally, we show in simulation how measurements of sensory neural responses can reveal information about a subject’s internal beliefs about the task. Taken together, our results reinterpret task-dependent sources of neural covariability as signatures of Bayesian inference and provide new insights into their cause and their function.

Hippocampal place cells, which display location-specific activity, are known to encode spatial information. A recent study in PLOS Biology by Curreli and colleagues shows that hippocampal astrocytes are implicated in encoding complementary spatial information, suggesting the existence of glial place cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CGG/GGC repeat expansion in <i>FMR1</i> and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> is reportedly associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i>, which was previously identified in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We screened for the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> in 1,346 movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in <i>LRP12</i> or <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, whereas 16 patients harbored &gt;40 CGG repeats in <i>GIPC1</i>, with 11 of these patients harboring &gt;60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded <i>GIPC1</i> allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by movement disorders in our population might harbor <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat expansion, with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (&lt;0.001). The clinical phenotypes of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in patients displaying <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> GGC repeat<i>-</i>positive movement disorders. Additionally, the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter hyperintensities but without typical <i>NOTCH2NLC</i>-related high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed deposition of intranuclear inclusions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The CGG repeat expansion in <i>GIPC1</i> might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Axonal Excitability Does Not Differ between Painful and Painless Diabetic or Chemotherapy‐Induced Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy in a Multicenter Observational Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function, and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (vs painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two hundred thirty-nine participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants who developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibers was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve, and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength–duration time constant, and current–threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, and there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated, and although there is some overlap of the "channelome" between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.

                Labombarde et al. investigate whether broadly reactive influenza antibodies, which may also bind self-antigens, contribute to autoimmunity. They demonstrate that induction of these antibodies also supports development of autoreactive antibodies in both humans and mice. Transferring broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies exacerbates autoimmunity in the context of inflammation or genetic susceptibility.

These cells, PAMEs, orchestrate a pro-metastatic tumoral ecosystem where ER stress, metastatic reprogramming, and stemness are critical. PAMEs thus appear as potential therapeutic and prevention targets.

                Alongside hypoxia, acidosis is a chemical signature of many solid tumors. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, Michl et al. find that cancer cells require NDUFS1 and other OXPHOS genes for survival in acidic environments. OXPHOS inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells at acidic pH, but permit survival at physiological pH, which defines a strategy for targeting acidic tumor regions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">In vivo imaging of mammary epithelial cell dynamics in response to lineage-biased Wnt/β-catenin activation</a></h4>

              
                Combining longitudinal intravital imaging with lineage tracing, Lloyd-Lewis et al. examine the early impact of sustained Wnt signaling on the dynamic behavior of specific luminal or basal mammary cells. They find that, irrespective of the lineage targeted, β-catenin stabilization invariably drives epidermal transdifferentiation of mammary cells, resulting in squamous metaplasia.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Biotin controls intestinal stem cell mitosis and host-microbiome interactions</a></h4>

              
                Biotin is an essential vitamin that humans and flies acquire from their food and microbiota. Neophytou and Pitsouli show that, in flies, biotin and its transporter, Smvt, function in intestinal stem cells to control mitosis, infection-induced regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Upon dietary biotin scarcity, biotin-producing microbiota can rescue reduced intestinal mitosis.

High levels of miR-130a are required for maintenance of this AML subtype by reinforcing the oncogenic molecular program of AML1-ETO.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that uniformly white sclera enhances the visibility of eye-gaze direction in humans and chimpanzees</a></h4>

              
                Hallmark social activities of humans, such as cooperation and cultural learning, involve eye-gaze signaling through joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. The gaze-signaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses posit that humans evolved unique external eye morphologies, including uniformly white sclera (the whites of the eye), to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze for conspecifics. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This study tested the ability of human and chimpanzee participants to discriminate the eye-gaze directions of human and chimpanzee images in computerized tasks. We varied the level of brightness and size in the stimulus images to examine the robustness of the eye-gaze directional signal against simulated shading and distancing. We found that both humans and chimpanzees discriminated eye-gaze directions of humans better than those of chimpanzees, particularly in visually challenging conditions. Also, participants of both species discriminated the eye-gaze directions of chimpanzees better when the contrast polarity of the chimpanzee eye was reversed compared to when it was normal; namely, when the chimpanzee eye has human-like white sclera and a darker iris. Uniform whiteness in the sclera thus facilitates the visibility of eye-gaze direction even across species. Our findings thus support but also critically update the central premises of the gaze-signaling hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temperature evolution following joint loading promotes chondrogenesis by synergistic cues via calcium signaling</a></h4>

              
                During loading of viscoelastic tissues, part of the mechanical energy is transformed into heat that can locally increase the tissue temperature, a phenomenon known as self-heating. In the framework of mechanobiology, it has been accepted that cells react and adapt to mechanical stimuli. However, the cellular effect of temperature increase as a by-product of loading has been widely neglected. In this work, we focused on cartilage self-heating to present a ‘thermo-mechanobiological’ paradigm, and demonstrate how the coupling of a biomimetic temperature evolution and mechanical loading could influence cell behavior. We thereby developed a customized in vitro system allowing to recapitulate pertinent in vivo physical cues and determined the cells chondrogenic response to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli. Cellular mechanisms of action and potential signaling pathways of thermo-mechanotransduction process were also investigated. We found that co-existence of thermo-mechanical cues had a superior effect on chondrogenic gene expression compared to either signal alone. Specifically, the expression of Sox9 was significantly upregulated by application of the physiological thermo-mechanical stimulus. Multimodal transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels were identified as key mediators of thermo-mechanotransduction process, which becomes ineffective without external calcium sources. We also observed that the isolated temperature evolution, as a by-product of loading, is a contributing factor to the cell response and this could be considered as important as the conventional mechanical loading. Providing an optimal thermo-mechanical environment by synergy of heat and loading portrays new opportunity for development of novel treatments for cartilage regeneration and can furthermore signal key elements for emerging cell-based therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Placental uptake and metabolism of 25(OH)vitamin D determine its activity within the fetoplacental unit</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with maternal and fetal health outcomes. Using physiological human placental perfusion and villous explants, we investigate the role of the placenta in regulating the relationships between maternal 25(OH)D and fetal physiology. We demonstrate active placental uptake of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> by endocytosis, placental metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>], with subsequent release of these metabolites into both the maternal and fetal circulations. Active placental transport of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> demonstrate that fetal supply is dependent on placental function rather than simply the availability of maternal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> exposure induces rapid effects on the placental transcriptome and proteome. These map to multiple pathways central to placental function and thereby fetal development, independent of vitamin D transfer. Our data suggest that the underlying epigenetic landscape helps dictate the transcriptional response to vitamin D treatment. This is the first quantitative study demonstrating vitamin D transfer and metabolism by the human placenta, with widespread effects on the placenta itself. These data demonstrate a complex interplay between vitamin D and the placenta and will inform future interventions using vitamin D to support fetal development and maternal adaptations to pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Confined migration promotes cancer metastasis through resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stress is known to fuel several hallmarks of cancer, ranging from genome instability to uncontrolled proliferation or invasion. Cancer cells are constantly challenged by mechanical stresses not only in the primary tumour but also during metastasis. However, this latter has seldom been studied with regards to mechanobiology, in particular resistance to anoikis, a cell death programme triggered by loss of cell adhesion. Here, we show in vitro that migrating breast cancer cells develop resistance to anoikis following their passage through microporous membranes mimicking confined migration (CM), a mechanical constriction that cancer cells encounter during metastasis. This CM-induced resistance was mediated by Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins, and sensitivity to anoikis could be restored after their inhibition using second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics. Anoikis-resistant mechanically stressed cancer cells displayed enhanced cell motility and evasion from natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance, as well as a marked advantage to form lung metastatic lesions in mice. Our findings reveal that CM increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chemotactic smoothing of collective migration</a></h4>

              
                Collective migration—the directed, coordinated motion of many self-propelled agents—is a fascinating emergent behavior exhibited by active matter with functional implications for biological systems. However, how migration can persist when a population is confronted with perturbations is poorly understood. Here, we address this gap in knowledge through studies of bacteria that migrate via directed motion, or chemotaxis, in response to a self-generated nutrient gradient. We find that bacterial populations autonomously smooth out large-scale perturbations in their overall morphology, enabling the cells to continue to migrate together. This smoothing process arises from spatial variations in the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient—revealing a population-scale consequence of the manner in which individual cells transduce external signals. Altogether, our work provides insights to predict, and potentially control, the collective migration and morphology of cellular populations and diverse other forms of active matter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Co-aggregation and secondary nucleation in the life cycle of human prolactin/galanin functional amyloids</a></h4>

              
                Synergistic-aggregation and cross-seeding by two different proteins/peptides in the amyloid aggregation are well evident in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we show co-storage of human Prolactin (PRL), which is associated with lactation in mammals, and neuropeptide galanin (GAL) as functional amyloids in secretory granules (SGs) of the female rat. Using a wide variety of biophysical studies, we show that irrespective of the difference in sequence and structure, both hormones facilitate their synergic aggregation to amyloid fibrils. Although each hormone possesses homotypic seeding ability, a unidirectional cross-seeding of GAL aggregation by PRL seeds and the inability of cross seeding by mixed fibrils suggest tight regulation of functional amyloid formation by these hormones for their efficient storage in SGs. Further, the faster release of functional hormones from mixed fibrils compared to the corresponding individual amyloid, suggests a novel mechanism of heterologous amyloid formation in functional amyloids of SGs in the pituitary.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of higher order thalamus during learning and correct performance in goal-directed behavior</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a gateway to the cortex. Cortical encoding of complex behavior can therefore only be understood by considering the thalamic processing of sensory and internally-generated information. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetics to investigate the role of axonal projections from the posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (POm) to the forepaw area of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (forepaw S1). By recording the activity of POm axonal projections within forepaw S1 during expert and chance performance in two tactile goal-directed tasks, we demonstrate that POm axons increase activity in the response and, to a lesser extent, reward epochs specifically during correct HIT performance. When performing at chance level during learning of a new behavior, POm axonal activity was decreased to naïve rates and did not correlate with task performance. However, once evoked, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were larger than during expert performance, suggesting POm input to S1 differentially encodes chance and expert performance. Furthermore, the POm influences goal-directed behavior, as photo-inactivation of archaerhodopsin-expressing neurons in the POm decreased the learning rate and overall success in the behavioral task. Taken together, these findings expand the known roles of the higher-thalamic nuclei, illustrating the POm encodes and influences correct action during learning and performance in a sensory-based goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical microtubule pulling forces contribute to the union of the parental genomes in the C. elegans zygote</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we reported that the Polo-like kinase PLK-1 phosphorylates the single <i>C. elegans </i>lamin (LMN-1) to trigger lamina depolymerization during mitosis. We showed that this event is required to form a pronuclear envelopes scission event that removes membranes on the juxtaposed oocyte and sperm pronuclear envelopes in the zygote, allowing the parental chromosomes to merge in a single nucleus after segregation (Velez-Aguilera et al., 2020). Here we show that cortical microtubule pulling forces contribute to pronuclear envelopes scission by promoting mitotic spindle elongation, and conversely, nuclear envelope remodeling facilitates spindle elongation. We also demonstrate that weakening the pronuclear envelopes via PLK-1-mediated lamina depolymerization, is a prerequisite for the astral microtubule pulling forces to trigger pronuclear membranes scission. Finally, we provide evidence that PLK-1 mainly acts via lamina depolymerization in this process. These observations thus indicate that temporal coordination between lamina depolymerization and mitotic spindle elongation facilitates pronuclear envelopes scission and parental genomes unification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of SHP-1 activity by PKC-θ regulates NK cell activation threshold and cytotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in immunity, killing virally infected and cancerous cells. The balance of signals initiated upon engagement of activating and inhibitory NK receptors with cognate ligands determines killing or tolerance. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating rapid NK cell discrimination between healthy and malignant cells in a heterogeneous tissue environment are incompletely understood. The SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase is the central negative NK cell regulator that dephosphorylates key activating signaling proteins. Though the mechanism by which SHP-1 mediates NK cell inhibition has been partially elucidated, the pathways by which SHP-1 is itself regulated remain unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylation of SHP-1 in NK cells on the S591 residue by PKC-θ promotes the inhibited SHP-1 ‘folded’ state. Silencing PKC-θ maintains SHP-1 in the active conformation, reduces NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, and promotes tumor progression in vivo. This study reveals a molecular pathway that sustains the NK cell activation threshold through suppression of SHP-1 activity.
