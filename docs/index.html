              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12783">Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12873">Emergent complexity and rhythms in evoked and spontaneous dynamics of human whole-brain models after tuning through analysis tools</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.

                arXiv:2410.10596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges, which we characterize as addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behaviour will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for ANNs: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss how large language models incorporate key aspects of this metalearning framework (namely, sequence prediction with feedback trained on diverse data), which helps to explain some of their successes on these classic challenges. Finally, we discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12812">Efficient lattice field theory simulation using adaptive normalizing flow on a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice field theory (LFT) simulations underpin advances in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, providing a unified computational framework across particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics. However, the application of these methods to high-dimensional systems remains severely constrained by several challenges, including the prohibitive computational cost and limited parallelizability of conventional sampling algorithms such as hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the substantial training expense associated with traditional normalizing flow models, and the inherent energy inefficiency of digital hardware architectures. Here, we introduce a software-hardware co-design that integrates an adaptive normalizing flow (ANF) model with a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver, enabling efficient generation of LFT configurations. Software-wise, ANF enables efficient parallel generation of statistically independent configurations, thereby reducing computational costs, while low-rank adaptation (LoRA) allows cost-effective fine-tuning across diverse simulation parameters. Hardware-wise, in-memory computing with resistive memory substantially enhances both parallelism and energy efficiency. We validate our approach on the scalar phi4 theory and the effective field theory of graphene wires, using a hybrid analog-digital neural differential equation solver equipped with a 180 nm resistive memory in-memory computing macro. Our co-design enables low-cost computation, achieving approximately 8.2-fold and 13.9-fold reductions in integrated autocorrelation time over HMC, while requiring fine-tuning of less than 8% of the weights via LoRA. Compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, our co-design achieves up to approximately 16.1- and 17.0-fold speedups for the two tasks, as well as 73.7- and 138.0-fold improvements in energy efficiency.

                arXiv:2509.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning meaningful sentences is different from learning a random set of words. When humans understand the meaning, the learning occurs relatively quickly. What mechanisms enable this to happen? In this paper, we examine the learning of novel sequences in familiar situations. We embed the Small World of Words (SWOW-EN), a Word Association Norms (WAN) dataset, in a spiking neural network based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model to simulate long-term memory. Results show that in the presence of SWOW-EN, there is a clear difference in speed between the learning of meaningful sentences and random noise. For example, short poems are learned much faster than sequences of random words. In addition, the system initialized with SWOW-EN weights shows greater tolerance to noise.

                arXiv:2509.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-black-box optimization has been significantly advanced through the use of large language models (LLMs), yet in fancy on constrained evolutionary optimization. In this work, AwesomeDE is proposed that leverages LLMs as the strategy of meta-optimizer to generate update rules for constrained evolutionary algorithm without human intervention. On the meanwhile, $RTO^2H$ framework is introduced for standardize prompt design of LLMs. The meta-optimizer is trained on a diverse set of constrained optimization problems. Key components, including prompt design and iterative refinement, are systematically analyzed to determine their impact on design quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem domains, suggesting its potential for broad applicability. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and data-driven methodology for automated constrained algorithm design, while also highlighting limitations and directions for future work.

                arXiv:2509.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new heuristic that focuses on the optimization problem for the Minimum Set Cover Problem. Our new heuristic involves using Wave Function Collapse and is called Wave Function Collapse Set Covering (WFC-SC). This algorithm goes through observation, propagation, and collapsing, which will be explained more later on in this paper. We optimize this algorithm to quickly find optimal coverings that are close to the minimum needed. To further optimize this algorithm, we pair it with the Hill Climbing metaheuristic to help WFC-SC find a better solution than its "local optimum." We benchmark our algorithm using the well known OR library from Brunel University against other proficient algorithms. We find that our algorithm has a better balance between both optimality and time.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13053">Traces Propagation: Memory-Efficient and Scalable Forward-Only Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients. However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning. Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient, scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes. Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way for efficient learning at the edge.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of neural networks, emulate the brain's information processing with unparalleled biological plausibility compared to traditional neural networks. However, their non-linear, event-driven dynamics pose significant challenges for training, and existing methods often deviate from neuroscientific principles of cortical learning. Drawing inspiration from predictive coding theory-a leading model of brain information processing-we propose PC-SNN, a novel learning framework that integrates predictive coding with SNNs to enable biologically plausible, local Hebbian plasticity without reliance on backpropagation. Unlike conventional SNN training approaches, PC-SNN leverages only local computations, aligning with the brain's distributed processing and overcoming the biological implausibility of global error propagation. Our classification model achieves competitive performance on the benchmark datasets, including Caltech Face/Motorbike, MNIST, and CIFAR10, surpassing state-of-the-art multi-layer SNNs. Furthermore, our predictive coding-based regression model outperforms backpropagation-based methods while adhering to local plasticity constraints, offering a scalable and biologically grounded alternative for SNN training. PC-SNN drives progress in neuromorphic computing through validating the adaptability of bio-inspired algorithms within spiking neural architectures, but also unveils novel understandings of neurocognitive learning processes, presenting a conceptual framework distinguished by its theoretical originality and functional efficacy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629">Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).

Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. However, a plethora of these algorithms require a more rigorous review before making them applicable to the relevant fields. This survey categorizes these algorithms into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their principles, strengths, novelty, and critical limitations. We provide a critique on the novelty issues of many of these algorithms. We illustrate some of the suitable usage of the prominent algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of reliable and authentic advancement of bio-inspired algorithms.

                arXiv:2408.17118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method in various applications of signal processing and feature extraction. It extends principal component analysis (PCA) and can extract important and complicated components with small variances. One of the major problems of ICA is that the uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed, unlike PCA. That is because there are many local optima in optimizing the objective function of ICA. It has been shown previously that the unique global optimum of ICA can be estimated from many random initializations by handcrafted thread computation. In this paper, the unique estimation of ICA is highly accelerated by reformulating the algorithm in matrix representation and reducing redundant calculations. Experimental results on artificial datasets and EEG data verified the efficiency of the proposed method.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526">Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.

                Background Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) is a major public health challenge in East Africa, particularly affecting children and women. Conventional therapies are often limited by accessibility and cost, prompting interest in plant-based interventions as affordable and locally available alternatives. This review explores the potential of medicinal plants in managing IDA, focusing on their phytochemical composition, mechanisms of action, and haematological effects. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted on July 17, 2024. The search strategy utilised Boolean operators and keywords related to plants, IDA management, and East Africa. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles published in English that evaluated plant-based treatments for IDA in preclinical or clinical trials. A total of 30 eligible studies were included after screening and quality assessment following PRISMA guidelines. Results The review identified plants such as Moringa oleifera, Phyllanthus emblica, and Telfairia occidentalis as effective in improving haemoglobin levels, red blood cell counts, and other haematological indices. Mechanisms include enhanced iron absorption, antioxidant activity, and stimulation of haematopoiesis. Extraction techniques commonly used were high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and aqueous methods. Key phytochemicals like flavonoids, saponins, and phenolic compounds played critical roles in IDA management. Despite promising outcomes, variations in treatment duration and protocols were noted, highlighting the need for standardisation. Conclusion Plant-based therapies offer accessible, cost-effective solutions for managing IDA in East Africa, leveraging local resources and phytochemical properties. However, further pharmacological and toxicological studies are essential to confirm safety and efficacy. This review emphasises the potential of medicinal plants in addressing IDA and calls for the exploration of underutilised plant species and the development of standardised therapeutic protocols.

                Diverse anthropogenic pressures are increasingly threatening paramo ecosystems. Prominent among these are the deliberate use of fire for land preparation, deforestation driven by commercial logging, and the expansion of agricultural frontiers—particularly through intensive potato cultivation. Additional stressors include extensive cattle grazing, sedimentation and eutrophication of aquatic systems, unregulated mining, and unsupervised tourism. The proliferation of road infrastructure without appropriate planning, coupled with the degradation of native biodiversity due to hunting and fishing, and the spread of invasive species, further exacerbate the ecological vulnerability of these high-altitude environments. The Sumapaz paramo —recognized as the largest in the world— is especially affected by these threats, due to its slow ecological recovery processes and inherent fragility. Within this context, the municipality of Pasca (Cundinamarca), encompassing over eleven thousand hectares of the Sumapaz paramo, is home to peasant communities traditionally engaged in agriculture and livestock. These rural settlements constitute spatially dynamic landscapes shaped by deep-rooted social relations. Despite being frequently identified as a primary threat to biodiversity conservation, the displacement of these populations is neither viable nor ethically appropriate. Instead, there is a critical need to investigate the perceptions and knowledge of local communities regarding environmental issues. Social mapping emerges as a powerful participatory methodology to visualize and document the perspectives of these communities—beyond their roles as agricultural producers tied to specific parcels of land. This article presents a participatory workshop-based methodology focused on the co-creation of social cartography by youth and peasant families from the villages of Juan Viejo, Costa Rica, and Quebradas—territories located within or adjacent to the Sumapaz paramo and bordering the National Natural Park.

                Introduction The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in systemic health, particularly in bone metabolism and periodontal integrity, through the gut–bone axis. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may indirectly contribute to dental implant failure by disrupting bone homeostasis and aggravating periodontal disease. Despite growing recognition of this relationship, comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies remains limited. This systematic review explores the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on implant-related tissues, its contribution to implant failure, and potential non-invasive interventions to improve outcomes. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and related databases was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Studies addressing the gut microbiota–bone health connection, gut microbiota–periodontium interactions, and their collective influence on implant success were included. Screening was based on predefined criteria, with data extraction focusing on mechanisms through which dysbiosis affects osseointegration and peri-implant health, as well as therapeutic approaches including probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions. Results The review revealed a strong association between gut dysbiosis and altered bone metabolism, impairing osseointegration and raising the risk of implant failure. Gut dysbiosis also exacerbated periodontal inflammation, predisposing to peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Non-invasive strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and targeted dietary modifications showed promise in restoring microbial balance, attenuating systemic inflammation, and supporting peri-implant tissue health. However, wide heterogeneity in study design and methodology restricted the strength and comparability of available evidence. Conclusion Gut microbiota dysbiosis is an emerging and underrecognized risk factor for implant failure. Modulating dysbiosis through non-invasive interventions may enhance osseointegration and peri-implant tissue integrity. Nevertheless, most current evidence arises from preclinical or small-scale human studies, highlighting the urgent need for robust, large-scale clinical trials.

                Background The farming industry faces continuous threats from pest control and farm security issues because rodents cause significant damage to crops and disrupt farm operations. Traditional pest control methods require continuous human interaction which proves both resource-intensive and inefficient. Modern agricultural practices benefit from sustainable solutions through the combination of renewable energy with smart technologies. Method The research presents an innovative solar-powered motion-sensor system that utilizes OpenCV-based image analysis to detect and classify rodent intruders on farmland autonomously. The system depends on solar panels for energy autonomy while employing computer vision to monitor threats in real time and classify them. Results The system demonstrates its ability to detect and prevent rodent intruders according to initial testing results. The OpenCV system uses motion sensor signals to analyze movement patterns before distinguishing rodents from other detected objects. The solar-powered system operates continuously which decreases human intervention needs and enhances farm surveillance capabilities. The model demonstrates its capability to defend crops from rodent damage and enhance farm resistance against land degradation threats. Conclusion The proposed system demonstrates progress in uniting renewable energy systems with smart surveillance technologies to mitigate agricultural risks. The current system encounters problems with detecting wild animals beyond rodents as well as tracking rodent activity beneath ground level. Future developments could include improved pest capture systems alongside enhanced surveillance features for detecting both unauthorized human intruders and large animals. The research shows that solar power systems need to be connected with automated monitoring technology to create sustainable agricultural operations that are efficient and resilient.

                Background Early and accurate prediction of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is essential for reducing mortality and enabling timely intervention. Misdiagnosis can lead to severe health outcomes, emphasizing the need for robust and intelligent predictive models. Deep learning approaches have shown strong potential in identifying hidden patterns in medical data and aiding clinical decision-making. Methods This study proposes a novel Hybrid Residual Attention with Echo State Network (HRAESN) model that integrates Attention Residual Learning (ARL) with Echo State Networks (ESN) to enhance feature extraction and temporal data learning. The hybrid model is designed to refine feature attention through residual learning while leveraging ESN for efficient time-series prediction. Two publicly available benchmark datasets were used for evaluation: the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset comprising 70,000 instances and the UCI Heart Disease dataset containing 303 instances. Missing values in both datasets were handled using a multiple imputation technique tailored for ischemic heart disease. Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure. Results The proposed HRAESN model demonstrated superior classification performance compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on the Kaggle dataset and 97.7% on the UCI dataset. Additionally, the model showed high sensitivity and specificity, indicating strong diagnostic capability and reliability in identifying both diseased and non-diseased cases. Conclusions The HRAESN model effectively combines the strengths of residual attention mechanisms and echo state networks, resulting in improved accuracy and stability for ischemic heart disease prediction. Its strong performance on benchmark datasets confirms its potential as a valuable clinical decision support tool for early detection of IHD. Future work may focus on optimizing model complexity and integrating real-time medical IoT data to enhance practical deployment in healthcare systems.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-554/v2?src=rss">Uterine arteriovenous malformation: A retrospective study from a tertiary center in southern Karnataka [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare cause of chronic to catastrophic vaginal bleeding. The basic pathology is an abnormal arteriovenous connection in the uterine myometrium, which is observed as an entangled serpentine vascular architecture on ultrasound. Color Doppler and higher imaging modalities with angiography are usually used to confirm a diagnosis. Materials and methods An electronic database of Obstetrics and Gynecology departments was searched for cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) between 2021 and 2025. Only cases of AVM confirmed by ultrasound or higher imaging were considered. Results We comprehensively reported 15 cases of arteriovenous malformations. All patients had acquired AVMs, with abnormal uterine bleeding as the main symptom in 93% of cases. The treatment provided was medical management in 26% of patients, conservative management by transcatheter embolization in 66%, and hysterectomy in 6.6%. Conclusion AVMs are rare in clinical practice, and an understanding of their pathophysiology and prompt diagnosis are highly important for managing this emergency. Fertility-preserving treatments include medical therapy and uterine artery embolization. Hysterectomy may be the definitive treatment for selected cases.

                <p>by Yanqing Dong, Jing Wei, Songjun Peng, Xinran Wu, Yaru Xu, Jianfeng Feng, Jie Zhang, Viktor Jirsa, Jie Xiang</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise in treating neurological disorders, particularly through dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) targeting. However, the effects of DLPFC-tDCS on brain functional networks and the underlying propagation mechanisms remain poorly understood. We present a novel tDCS hybrid brain model (tDCS-HBM) that incorporates tDCS-induced gray matter electric fields into a large-scale brain network model, considering their relationship with membrane potential to effectively predict spatiotemporal dynamics. Using this model, we simulated brain activity in response to tDCS over the left (F3-Fp2) and right DLPFC (F4-Fp1). Our results demonstrate that tDCS enhances brain complexity and flexibility, leading to increased functional connectivity (FC) across the whole brain and an improvement in global network efficiency. Dynamic analysis reveals an initial FC decline, followed by widespread enhancement originating from inferior and orbital frontal regions. Importantly, right DLPFC-tDCS induces strong FC associated with the ventral attention network. These changes in topological metrics and spatiotemporal patterns are consistent with prior modeling and empirical findings, validating the utility of our tDCS-HBM in understanding propagation mechanisms. Our hybrid model holds the potential to predict the stimulation effects of modulation protocols, providing precise guidance for clinical neuromodulation interventions.

                <p>by Futa Tomita, Jun-nosuke Teramae</p>

The entorhinal cortex serves as a major gateway connecting the hippocampus and neocortex, playing a pivotal role in episodic memory formation. Neurons in the entorhinal cortex exhibit two notable features associated with temporal information processing: a population-level ability to encode long temporal signals and a single-cell characteristic known as graded-persistent activity, where some neurons maintain activity for extended periods even without external inputs. However, the relationship between these single-cell characteristics and population dynamics has remained unclear, largely due to the absence of a framework to describe the dynamics of neural populations with highly heterogeneous time scales. To address this gap, we extend the dynamical mean field theory, a powerful framework for analyzing large-scale population dynamics, to study the dynamics of heterogeneous neural populations. By proposing an analytically tractable model of graded-persistent activity, we demonstrate that the introduction of graded-persistent neurons shifts the chaos-order phase transition point and expands the network’s dynamical region, a preferable region for temporal information computation. Furthermore, we validate our framework by applying it to a system with heterogeneous adaptation, demonstrating that such heterogeneity can reduce the dynamical regime, contrary to previous simplified approximations. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the functional advantages of diversity in biological systems and offer insights applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous networks beyond neural populations.

Biological networks provide a structured framework for analyzing the dynamic interplay and interactions between molecular entities, facilitating deeper insights into cellular functions and biological processes. Network construction often requires extensive manual curation based on scientific literature and public databases, a time-consuming and laborious task. To address this challenge, we introduce NeKo, a Python package to automate the construction of biological networks by integrating and prioritizing molecular interactions from various databases. NeKo allows users to provide their molecules of interest (e.g., genes, proteins or phosphosites), select interaction resources and apply flexible strategies to build networks based on prior knowledge. Users can filter interactions by various criteria, such as direct or indirect links and signed or unsigned interactions, to tailor the network to their needs and downstream analysis. We demonstrate some of NeKo’s capabilities in two use cases: first we construct a network based on transcriptomics from medulloblastoma; in the second, we model drug synergies. NeKo streamlines the network-building process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers.

                <p>by Peng Xu, Rubia Isler Mancuso, Marianna Leonzino, Caroline J. Zeiss, Diane S. Krause, Pietro De Camilli</p>

VPS13 is the founding member of a family of proteins that mediate lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contact sites by a bridge-like mechanism. Mammalian genomes comprise 4 <i>VPS13</i> genes encoding proteins with distinct localizations and function. The gene duplication resulting in <i>VPS13A</i> and <i>VPS13C</i> is the most recent in evolution and, accordingly, these two proteins are the most similar to each other. However, they have distinct subcellular localizations and their loss of function mutations in humans are compatible with life but result in two different age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and Parkinson’s disease, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether these two proteins have overlapping functions. Here, we show that while <i>Vps13a</i> KO and <i>Vps13c</i> KO mice are viable, embryonic development of <i>Vps13a/Vps13c</i> double knockout (DKO) mice is arrested at midgestation. Prior to death, DKO embryos were smaller than controls, were anemic and had a smaller liver, most likely reflecting defective embryonic erythropoiesis which at this developmental stage occurs primarily in this organ. Further analyses of erythroid precursor cells showed that their differentiation was impaired and that this defect was accompanied by activation of innate immunity as revealed by upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, the RIG-I and MDA5 components of dsRNA triggered innate immunity were found upregulated in the DKO fetal liver. Activation of innate immunity may result from loss of integrity of the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and autophagic lysosomes, or to impaired autophagy, due to the absence of these lipid transport proteins. The surprising and striking synthetic effect resulting for the combined loss of VPS13A and VPS13C suggests that despite of the different localization of these two proteins, the lipid fluxes that they mediate are partially redundant.

Discriminative learning enhances contrast between sensory inputs to allow fast and accurate decision-making. However, the neural mechanisms that selectively enhance sensory representations to improve discrimination remain unclear. Here, we show that learning-induced differential gating of olfactory inputs takes place at the first stage of sensory processing in the mouse olfactory bulb and requires dopaminergic short axons cells (SACs). Optical imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and electron microscopy experiments reveal that synaptic and structural plasticity in SACs allows odor valence-based modulation of their interactions with other cell types in the olfactory glomeruli. Importantly, an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression by SACs surrounding responding glomeruli, with a bias towards those activated by reward odors, creates a valence-based modulation of sensory input. Further, we identify cholinergic input from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band as the valence-dependent signal that modulates SAC activities and refines sensory representation via disinhibition. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism where an interneuron population serves as a central hub integrating sensory input and top–down signal to enhance sensory acuity.

                <p>by Rahul Garg, Qiang Qiu, C. Ron Yu</p>

By selectively amplifying relevant sensory input, animals efficiently allocate limited cognitive resources to improve decision-making. Allocation of attention is aligned with behavioral goals and adaptive to cognitive demand, but the circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify an attention circuit for odor processing where cholinergic neurons in the horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band provide top–down control through inhibitory dopaminergic short-axon cells in the mouse olfactory bulb. Attentional cue triggered cholinergic activity provides preparatory disinhibition of olfactory sensory axons to enhance response to reward-associated odors and improves decision-making. Preparatory, but not reward-dependent, cholinergic activity is disengaged in proficient animals when the task becomes routine, underlying a trade-off between proficiency and attention engagement. Direct manipulation of the disinhibitory circuit reinstates attentional effect without eliciting general arousal. A computational model of the circuit recapitulates the dynamic change in attention responses and illustrates a two-stage adaptation that efficiently allocates cognitive resources.

                <p>by Ian M. Traniello, Arian Avalos, Michael J. M. Gachomba, Tim Gernat, Zhenqing Chen, Amy C. Cash-Ahmed, Adam R. Hamilton, Jennifer L. Cook, Gene E. Robinson</p>

Individual variation in sociability is a central feature of every society. This includes honey bees, with some individuals well connected and sociable, and others at the periphery of their colony’s social network. However, the genetic and molecular bases of sociability are poorly understood. Trophallaxis—a behavior involving sharing liquid with nutritional and signaling properties—comprises a social interaction and a proxy for sociability in honey bee colonies: more sociable bees engage in more trophallaxis. Here, we identify genetic and molecular mechanisms of trophallaxis-based sociability by combining genome sequencing, brain transcriptomics, and automated behavioral tracking. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in sociability. Several SNPs were localized to genes previously associated with sociability in other species, including in the context of human autism, suggesting shared molecular mechanisms of sociability. Variation in sociability also was linked to differential brain gene expression, particularly genes associated with neural signaling and development. Using comparative genomic and transcriptomic approaches, we also detected evidence for divergent mechanisms underpinning sociability across species, including those related to reward sensitivity and encounter probability. These results highlight both potential evolutionary conservation of the molecular roots of sociability and points of divergence.

Although metabolic benefits of glycolysis have been extensively described in tumor cells, the extra-metabolic functions linked to this energetic pathway in tumor growth and cell proliferation have not been clearly established yet. Recently, some key glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase 2, were reported to regulate mRNA translation. Translational control of gene expression is considered as a critical effector in cancer biology, representing a highly promising area of research. Here, we report that Hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glucose kinase that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulates mRNA translation in melanoma cell lines. Polysome profiling experiments followed by RNA sequencing indicate that the translational regulation exerted by HK2 is partly independent of the metabolic status or the glycolytic pathway. We found that HK2 specifically regulates translation of the mRNA encoding SOX10, a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression in melanoma. RNA-protein interaction assays, including CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP), indicate that HK2 is an RBP whose interaction with RNA is independent of its enzymatic activity, its ability to bind glucose or its association with the OMM. HK2 directly interacts with the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of the <i>SOX10</i> mRNA through a stem-loop RNA secondary structure. Using RNA-protein proximity ligation assays and a fluorescence-based ribosome-bound mRNA mapping method, we found that high glucose conditions, which promote the release of HK2 from the OMM, induce an increase in HK2-<i>SOX10</i> mRNA interaction and <i>SOX10</i> mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. We further showed that HK2-dependent <i>SOX10</i> mRNA translation is involved in melanoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our data highlight a nonmetabolic function of HK2 acting as an RBP and translation regulator.

<p>This is a schematic representation of the experimental design and main findings. Mice underwent sciatic nerve transection, which was then repaired using a PLA conduit. The mice were then treated with inosine and/or treadmill training. Combining inosine and treadmill training enhanced axonal regeneration synergistically, improving electrophysiological parameters, increasing neuronal survival and preserving muscle morphology. This ultimately led to superior functional recovery compared to single therapies.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve injuries are a major cause of disability, leading to significant sensorimotor impairment and functional loss. These injuries can result from traumatic or non-traumatic events, with severe cases posing therapeutic challenges. Neurorrhaphy is the gold standard for treating injuries where the gap between nerve stumps is less than 3 cm, while autografting is used for larger gaps. Despite various therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing peripheral nerve regeneration, restoring pre-injury function remains difficult in clinical practice, prompting the exploration of experimental therapies. This study examined the effects of treadmill training and inosine treatment on sciatic nerve regeneration after transection in mice. Male C57/Bl6 mice (8–12 weeks) underwent sciatic nerve transection, with the proximal and distal stumps sutured to a polylactic acid tubular graft, creating a 3 mm gap. The mice were treated with saline or inosine (70 mg/mL) for 1 week, followed by treadmill exercise starting in the second week. The exercise protocol involved treadmill speeds of 6–12 m/min, three times per week for 10 min, continuing for 8 weeks. Functional recovery was assessed weekly using the Sciatic Functional Index, pinprick test, and Von Frey electronic analgesiometer. At the end of the study, electrophysiological tests and morphologic analysis were performed. The results showed that the combination of inosine with treadmill training significantly accelerated functional recovery and nerve regeneration, suggesting that this combined approach may offer a promising alternative for improving recovery outcomes in cases of peripheral nerve injury.</p>

                This perspective examines sleep’s mechanism (“how”) and function (“why”). The motor theory posits that sleep is governed by distributed motor-control circuits; the catecholamine hypothesis identifies catecholamine inactivation as the unifying process underlying sleep’s restorative effects on metabolism, immunity, and cognition.

Increased accumulation of Z-RNA during senescence promotes ZBP1 activation. Epigenetic modulation represents a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize anti-HER2 immunotherapy.

                Chhikara et al. show that neuronal STIM proteins are highly dynamic in the ER-plasma membrane but avoid synapses. While STIM2 clusters are modulated by basal NMDAR activity, stimulation of NMDAR triggers co-clustering of STIM1 and STIM2. The clustering of STIM proteins is independent from the activity of CaV1.2 channels.

                Li et al. reported that nuclear cGAS cooperates with CTCF to form chromatin interactions, stabilizing TNFRSF costimulatory receptor expression for optimal thymic Treg selection. This non-canonical, STING-independent role enables Treg development. Treg-specific cGAS deletion impairs suppression and reduces tumor growth, which redefines cGAS as a nuclear architect of immune tolerance.

                Thistlethwaite et al. use blood samples from a human influenza H3N2 challenge study to perform comprehensive multi-omics analyses, finding that circulating innate immune cells show persistent remodeling after resolution of infection, including suppressed inflammation. These results reveal a coordinated rewiring of the innate immune molecular landscape from mild influenza infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104833">Novel and optimized mouse behavior enabled by fully autonomous HABITS: Home-cage assisted behavioral innovation and testing system</a></h4>

              
                Mice are among the most prevalent animal models used in neuroscience, benefiting from the extensive physiological, imaging, and genetic tools available to study their brain. However, the development of novel and optimized behavioral paradigms for mice has been laborious and inconsistent, impeding the investigation of complex cognitions. Here, we present a home-cage assisted mouse behavioral innovation and testing system (HABITS), enabling free-moving mice to learn challenging cognitive behaviors in their home-cage without any human involvement. Supported by the general programming framework, we have not only replicated established paradigms in current neuroscience research but also developed novel paradigms previously unexplored in mice, resulting in more than 300 mice demonstrated in various cognition functions. Most significantly, HABITS incorporates a machine-teaching algorithm, which comprehensively optimized the presentation of stimuli and modalities for trials, leading to more efficient training and higher-quality behavioral outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where mouse behavior has been systematically optimized by an algorithmic approach. Altogether, our results open a new avenue for mouse behavioral innovation and optimization, which directly facilitates investigation of neural circuits for novel cognitions with mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103107">Prophage regulation of Shewanella fidelis 3313 motility and biofilm formation with implications for gut colonization dynamics in Ciona robusta</a></h4>

              
                Lysogens, bacteria with one or more viruses (prophages) integrated into their genomes, are abundant in the gut of animals. Prophages often influence bacterial traits; however, the influence of prophages on the gut microbiota–host immune axis in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of the prophage SfPat on <i>Shewanella fidelis</i> 3313, a persistent member of the gut microbiome of the model marine tunicate, <i>Ciona robusta</i>. Establishment of a SfPat deletion mutant (ΔSfPat) reveals the influence of this prophage on bacterial physiology in vitro and during colonization of the <i>Ciona</i> gut. In vitro, deletion of SfPat reduces <i>S. fidelis</i> 3313 motility and swimming while increasing biofilm formation. To understand the in vivo impact of these prophage-induced changes in bacterial traits, we exposed metamorphic stage 4 <i>Ciona</i> juveniles to wildtype (WT) and ΔSfPat strains. During colonization, ΔSfPat localizes to overlapping and distinct areas of the gut compared to the WT strain. We examined the differential expression of various regulators of cyclic-di-GMP, a secondary signaling molecule that mediates biofilm formation and motility. The <i>pdeB</i> gene, which encodes a bacterial phosphodiesterase known to influence biofilm formation and motility by degrading cyclic-di-GMP, is upregulated in the WT strain but not in ΔSfPat when examined in vivo. Expression of the <i>Ciona</i> gut immune effector, VCBP-C, is enhanced during colonization by ΔSfPat compared to the WT strain; however, VCBP-C binding to the WT strain does not promote the excision of SfPat in an SOS-dependent pathway. Instead, VCBP-C binding significantly reduces the expression of a phage major capsid protein. Our findings suggest that SfPat influences host perception of this important colonizing commensal and highlights the significance of investigating tripartite dynamics between prophages, bacteria, and their animal hosts to better understand the gut microbiota-host immune axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104797">Magnetotactic bacteria optimally navigate natural pore networks</a></h4>

              
                Magnetotactic bacteria swim along geomagnetic field lines to navigate the pore spaces of water-saturated sediment. To understand the physical basis for efficient navigation in confined geometries, we observe the motion of multicellular magnetotactic bacteria through an artificial pore space under an applied magnetic field. Magnetotaxis is fastest when bacteria swim a distance that is of order the pore size in the time required to align with the applied field. A model—in which bacteria deterministically align with the magnetic field and randomly scatter off boundaries—predicts the observed non-monotonic relationship between the drift velocity and applied magnetic field and the value of the maximum drift velocity. A comparison of the reported values of the magnetic moments, swimming speeds, and hydrodynamic mobilities across diverse magnetotactic bacteria reveals that these variables covary such that the average speed of magnetotaxis of each species is close to optimal for its natural environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100785">Structure transfer and consolidation in visual implicit learning</a></h4>

              
                Transfer learning, the re-application of previously learned higher-level regularities to novel input, is a key challenge in cognition. While previous empirical studies investigated human transfer learning in supervised or reinforcement learning for explicit knowledge, it is unknown whether such transfer occurs during naturally more common implicit and unsupervised learning and, if so, how it is related to memory consolidation. We compared the transfer of newly acquired explicit and implicit abstract knowledge during unsupervised learning by extending a visual statistical learning paradigm to a transfer learning context. We found transfer during unsupervised learning, but with important differences depending on the explicitness/implicitness of the acquired knowledge. Observers acquiring explicit knowledge during initial learning could transfer the learned structures immediately. In contrast, observers with the same amount but implicit knowledge showed the opposite effect, a structural interference during transfer. However, with sleep between the learning phases, implicit observers, while still remaining implicit, switched their behavior and showed the same pattern of transfer as explicit observers did. This effect was specific to sleep and not found after non-sleep consolidation. Our results highlight similarities and differences between explicit and implicit learning while acquiring generalizable higher-level knowledge and relying on consolidation for restructuring internal representations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101137">Altered thymic niche synergistically drives the massive proliferation of malignant thymocytes</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of genetic alterations in patient samples over the last decades has reinforced a cell-autonomous view of proliferative expansion during T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development in the thymus. However, the potential contribution of non-cell-autonomous factors, particularly the impact of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) within the thymic niche during the initiation phase, remains unexplored. In this study, we combine a cell-based computational model of the thymus with complementary in vivo experiments in medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) to systematically analyze the impact of 12 cell-autonomous and non-autonomous factors, individually and in combination, on the proliferation of normal and malignant thymocytes carrying interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R) gain-of-function mutations or elevated IL7R levels, as observed in T-ALL patients. By simulating over 1500 scenarios, we show that while a dense TEC network favored the proliferation of normal thymocytes, it inhibited the proliferation of malignant lineages, which achieved their maximal proliferative capacity when TECs were sparsely distributed. Our in silico model further predicts that specific mutations could accelerate proliferative expansion within a few days. This prediction was experimentally validated, revealing the rapid onset of thymic lymphoma and systemic infiltration of malignant T cells within just 8 days of embryonic development. These findings demonstrate that synergistic interaction between oncogenic alterations and modifications in the thymic niche can significantly accelerate disease progression. Our results also suggest that negative feedback from the proliferative state suppresses thymocyte differentiation. Overall, this multidisciplinary work reveals the critical role of TEC-thymocyte interactions in both the initiation and progression of T-ALL, highlighting the importance of the thymic microenvironment in early leukemogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100328">The ciliary kinesin KIF7 controls the development of the cerebral cortex by acting differentially on SHH signaling in dorsal and ventral forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Mutations of <i>KIF7</i>, a key ciliary component of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, are associated in humans with cerebral cortex malformations and clinical features suggestive of cortical dysfunction. KIF7 regulates the processing of GLI-A and GLI3-R transcription factors in a SHH-dependent manner both in humans and in mice. Here, we examine the embryonic cortex development of a mouse model that lacks the expression of KIF7 (<i>Kif7<sup>-/-</sup></i>). The cortex is composed of principal neurons generated locally in the dorsal telencephalon where SHH expression is low and inhibitory interneurons (cIN) generated in the ventral telencephalon where SHH expression is high. We observe a strong impact of <i>Kif7</i> deletion on the dorsal cortex development whose abnormalities resemble those of GLI3-R mutants: subplate cells are absent, the intermediate progenitor layer and cortical plate do not segregate properly, and corticofugal axons do not develop timely, leading to a delayed colonization of the telencephalon by thalamocortical axons. These structural defects alter the cortical distribution of cIN, which moreover exhibit intrinsic migration defects and cortical trajectories resembling those of cyclopamine-treated cIN. Our results show that <i>Kif7</i> deletion impairs the cortex development in multiple ways, exhibiting opposite effects on SHH pathway activity in the developing principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons.

">Carbonized rubber electrodes can cause a DC-offset in transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Carbonized rubber electrodes are widely used in non-invasive brain stimulation studies. Due to their polarizable nature, however, they can cause a voltage offset, which might be problematic for concurrent EEG studies. Objective: In this study, we aim to describe the voltage offset and ensure that the offset does not alter the intended waveform of applied stimulation. Methods: Using data from 2 human studies and phantom measurements, which employed carbonized rubber electrodes, we quantify the magnitude and frequency of DC-offsets and contrast this against pilot-measurements using Ag/AGCl-electrodes. In a further phantom study, we record the offset-voltage that arises from the electrode/electrolyte interface and compare this to the voltage put out by the stimulation device. Results: A non-zero voltage offset is present in all human and phantom studies employing carbonized rubber electrodes, while the offset using Ag/AgCl electrodes is close to zero. Direct measurements of the stimulator output in the presence of a measurable voltage offset at the stimulation electrodes shows that the offset originates from the electrodes and not from the current provided by the stimulation device. Conclusion: Using carbonized rubber-electrodes for stimulation can result in the emergence of a measurable voltage offset, due to their polarizable nature. We argue that this offset can be problematic in concurrent EEG recordings, as they pose the risk of amplifier saturation and distortions of the recorded stimulation waveform.

">ALS mutations do not alter perineuronal net formation in human stem cell-derived motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix structures that stabilise synaptic inputs and regulate neuronal plasticity. Although PNN dysregulation is observed in several neurological disorders, their relevance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unclear. In particular, the extent to which PNN alterations in ALS are motor neuron (MN)-intrinsic is unknown. We investigated whether human pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs form PNN-like structures in vitro, and whether ALS-associated mutations alter this process. We show that MNs generate PNN-like structures containing hyaluronan, tenascin-R, and aggrecan and that their formation and gene expression were not altered by ALS mutations. To explore whether PNN dysregulation reflects contributions from other cell types or selective MN vulnerability, we conducted meta-analyses of transcriptomic datasets from pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes carrying ALS-associated mutations, as well as datasets comparing MN populations with differential susceptibility to ALS. These analyses revealed no consistent differences in PNN-related gene expression in human stem cell-derived MN. In contrast, transcriptomic analyses of human post-mortem ALS tissues revealed significant dysregulation of PNN-related genes, including core PNN components and linker proteins. These findings suggest that PNN changes in ALS are not MN-intrinsic, but may result from interactions with other cell types in the central nervous system such as glia.

">Effect of cannabinol, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidiol on voluntary alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system plays a significant role in the development of the alcohol use disorder (AUD), and CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists showed promise as a novel AUD pharmacotherapy. However, these compounds failed in clinical trials due to the severe psychiatric side effects. It has been suggested that non-psychoactive phytocannabinoids may have a better safety profile and could be used as an alternative approach to treat AUD. Hence, the aim of this study was to test the potential of three phytocannabinoids in reducing alcohol consumption: CB1 receptor partial agonist cannabinol (CBN), neutral antagonist tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and negative allosteric modulator cannabidiol (CBD). For this purpose, male Wistar rats were subjected to a long-term voluntary alcohol drinking procedure that lasted for at least 6 months. Thereafter, rats were given 3 daily administrations of CBN, THCV or CBD. A side-effect profile of all three compounds was measured by recording water consumption, body weight changes and home-cage locomotor activity. Ultrasonic vocalisations were recorded before and after a single administration of CBN, THCV or CBD in alcohol-naive group-housed rats to monitor if these compounds induced discomfort, distress or other changes in emotional states of rats. Our data demonstrated that all phytocannabinoids reduced voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. However, compounds differed in their effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption and the side-effect profile. Treatment with CBN and THCV reduced alcohol intake and demonstrated a good safety profile. In contrast, CBD only had a minor effect on alcohol consumption, reduced the locomotor activity and lowered the positive emotional states of rats. None of the compounds caused discomfort or distress. We conclude that phytocannabinoids acting as CB1 receptor partial agonists or neutral antagonists may have potential in treatment of AUD.

">Assessing the digit organisation of focal hand dystonia using 7T functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is typically treated with Botulinum Toxin (BTX/BoNT-A/Botox/ Onabotulinum Toxin Type A) injected into digit and wrist muscles to provide temporary symptomatic relief from muscle spasm. We use 7T functional MRI (fMRI) to study 1) differences in somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps between FHD individuals and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV), 2) changes in cortical digit maps of FHD individuals after BTX treatment. Methods: Six FHD patients underwent behavioural measures and 7T fMRI at two timepoints: ~30 days after BTX treatment at peak efficacy (Post-BTX), immediately prior to their next injection ~100 days after treatment when therapeutic effects had declined (Pre-BTX). HVs were scanned at a single time point. Behavioural measures included temporal discrimination (TDT), amplitude thresholding (AMP) and spatial acuity grating orientation tasks. A somatosensory travelling wave (TW) digit-mapping fMRI task was performed on dominant/affected and non-dominant/un-affected hands, and a motor TW digit-mapping task on the dominant/affected hand. Fourier analysis derived digit maps which were compared to a probabilistic digit atlas, and population receptive field (pRF) mapping performed. Structural and resting state fMRI data were acquired. Results: Spatial acuity was lowered in the dominant/affected hand in FHD compared to HVs, while TDT and AMP measures showed no significant differences. Somatosensory and motor TW cortical digit maps in FHD and HV showed clear digit ordering. Somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps were more disordered in the dominant/affected hand than the non-dominant hand for FHD Post and Pre-BTX compared to HVs (DICE coefficient/Figure of Merit). Compared to the atlas, HV maps were in-line for both hands, while in FHD central tendency (CT) was lower in the dominant/affected hand than non-dominant hand. pRF sizes were larger in the FHD Pre-BTX group compared to HV and Post-BTX for the dominant hand. Conclusion: Behaviourally, FHD participants had lower spatial acuity than HVs. FHD digit maps had typical D1-D5 ordering, but DICE coefficients identified a disordered dominant hand in FHDs compared to HVs at both timepoints. The FHD Pre-BTX group had larger pRF sizes than Post-BTX and HVs, suggesting BTX treatment coincides with more localised touch perception.

">Young adult microglial deletion of C1q reduces engulfment of synapses and prevents cognitive impairment in an aggressive Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                C1q is a multifunctional protein, including its role as the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade. While classical pathway activation is involved in synaptic pruning during development of the nervous system, it also contributes to enhanced inflammation and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Constitutive genetic C1q deficiency has been shown to reduce glial activation and attenuate neuronal loss in AD mouse models, but the specific contributions of microglial C1q to AD pathology while avoiding deficits during post-natal development remain to be determined. To dissect specific role(s) of microglial C1q in AD progression, we crossed the Cx3cr1CreERT2 mouse model that deletes C1q from microglia in young adulthood (8 weeks of age) to the aggressive Arctic48 (Arc) amyloidosis mouse model. At 10 months, young adult microglial C1q deletion (Arc C1q{Delta}MG) rescued cognitive deficits in spatial memory, despite unchanged amyloid plaque burden. Furthermore, Arc C1q{Delta}MG)MG mice exhibited reduced hippocampal C3 protein levels without altering C3 mRNA. No changes were observed in C5aR1, astrocyte GFAP, or microglial Iba1 protein expression. However, Arc C1q{Delta}MG mice demonstrated region specific reductions in microglial synaptic engulfment, alongside decreased phagolysosome-associated amyloid in both microglia and astrocytes, and reduced compaction of amyloid within the hippocampus. These findings support a role for C1q in astrocytic C3 induction and the engulfment of both synapses and amyloid. Importantly, young adult microglial C1q inhibition confers cognitive benefits without exacerbating amyloid pathology, suggesting a therapeutic window in which targeting microglial C1q may mitigate neuroinflammation and synaptic loss during the later stages of AD.

">Lateral hypothalamus CRFR1 regulation of chronic binge drinking: divergence along anterior-posterior axis</a></h4>

              
                Binge alcohol drinking increases the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid psychopathology. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a brain structure that integrates cognitive and sensory information to tightly regulate motivated behavior, including binge drinking. Importantly, LH function is vulnerable to modulation by the pro-stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and acute antagonism of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) in the LH blunts binge drinking. However, the role of LH CRFR1 in chronic binge drinking is unknown. We used genetically targeted knockdown (KD) of CRFR1 in the LH of male and female mice followed by three weeks of binge drinking using the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. CRFR1 KD in the posterior LH increased alcohol consumption, independent of sex, with no effect of KD in the anterior LH. Consistent with this, total alcohol consumption was negatively correlated with the location of CRFR1 KD in the LH along the anterior-posterior axis. CRFR1 KD did not alter water consumption or body weight, suggesting the effects of CRFR1 KD on alcohol consumption were not due to broad disruption of fluid intake or homeostatic function. In contrast to the observed effects on binge drinking, CRFR1 KD increased anxiety-like behavior and blunted sucrose preference, independent of KD location in the LH. Our findings provide foundational insight into LH function in the context of AUD and prompt further investigation into the divergent roles that distinct circuitry or cell populations along the anterior-posterior axis of the LH may play in binge drinking.

">Neuronal HDAC9: A key regulator of cognitive and synaptic aging, rescuing Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic regulation is a key determinant of the aging process, and its dysregulation contributes to cognitive aging and increased vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease (AD). As major regulators of epigenetic processes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the distinct roles of individual HDAC isoforms remain to be defined. Here, we report that HDAC9 is specifically expressed in neurons of human and mouse brains, and its expression declines with age. HDAC9 deficiency impairs cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in young mice. Selective deletion of HDAC9 in hippocampal CA1 neurons also induces cognitive impairment. In contrast, overexpression of HDAC9 in forebrain glutamatergic neurons preserves cognitive function in aged mice. Moreover, HDAC9 is also downregulated in the brain of AD mouse models, whereas neuronal overexpression of HDAC9 alleviates AD-related cognitive and synaptic deficits and reduces A{beta} deposition. Together, these findings suggest neuronal HDAC9 is necessary and sufficient for maintaining cognitive and synaptic functions in the context of aging and AD.

">ALM enables contextual decision-making via dynamic reconfiguration of local circuits</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive operations often require flexible implementation of stimulus-response contingencies, depending on context. We developed an olfactory task in which mice learned to associate a test odor with a directional lick response, conditional on a preceding context odor drawn from a different odor set. Two-photon imaging revealed that anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) contains distinct populations encoding context, test odors, and choice. Optogenetic silencing during the context and delay periods impaired performance, suggesting that ALM contributes to configuring the appropriate contingency. Although context odors that instructed the same mapping were represented by separate populations, their influence converged at the level of choice-selective neurons. A subpopulation of these neurons exhibited dual selectivity for context and choice, forming what we term "contingency neurons". These findings suggest that ALM supports flexible behavior not by abstracting over context cues, but by dynamically reconfiguring local circuits to route sensory input to the appropriate motor output.

">p75 Neurotrophin Receptor Shapes the Dynamics of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is essential for cognitive flexibility and emotional resilience, and its disruption is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease, a disorder marked by cognitive decline and memory impairment. The p75 neurotrophin receptor regulates neuronal survival and plasticity, yet its contribution to adult hippocampal neurogenesis, especially under neurodegeneration, remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of p75NTR in Adult Neurogenesis using constitutive and conditional p75NTR knockout mice, the amyloidogenic 5xFAD model, and 5xFAD/p75NTR knockout mutants. We show that p75NTR deletion led to a significant reduction in NSC proliferation and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus, acting in a cell non-autonomous function to control neural stem cell fate. Notably, 5xFAD/p75NTR mutants displayed exacerbated neurogenic deficits compared to 5xFAD mice. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed these alterations and supported a disease-relevant regulatory function. Parallel studies in human iPSC-derived neural stem cells exposed to amyloid-? showed p75NTR-dependent mechanisms mirroring findings from the mouse models. Collectively, our findings establish p75NTR as a critical regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, under Alzheimer's Disease and propose it as a therapeutic target.

">Contributions of superior colliculus and primary visual cortex to visual spatial detection in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Visual spatial detection is a crucial first step in vision to guide decision-making and action. However, its neural basis in freely behaving animals remains unclear due to challenges in controlling visual input and monitoring eye and head position. Studies in head-fixed mice have shown that both the superior colliculus (SC) and primary visual cortex (V1), two key visual processing hubs in mammals, contribute to visual spatial detection. Yet, their relative roles in freely moving animals are poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel approach to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial detection in unrestrained mice. We combined closed-loop presentation of visual stimuli with neural recordings, optogenetic manipulation, and simultaneous monitoring of eye and head position. Our results show that SC cells are more predictive of reaction times than V1 cells. Furthermore, SC neurons exhibit more sustained activity than V1 neurons during visual spatial detection. Optogenetic SC and V1 silencing causes pervasive and remarkably localized perturbations of visual detection performance. SC silencing has a stronger impact on visual detection than V1 silencing. These results highlight the distinct activity patterns in two principal early visual processing centers, and establish their relative causal contributions to visual spatial detection.

">The cellular basis of mitochondrial stress signaling in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal vulnerability to stress is highly cell-type specific, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that the ability to activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling is encoded by the relative mitochondrial metabolic activity of neurons. Genetically inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in the Drosophila brain caused the emergence of a novel cluster of neurons, detected using single nuclear RNA-sequencing, that activated the ER unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR activation occurred only in neurons with high mitochondrial activity. Unexpectedly, mitochondria-ER contacts were also abundant in the neurons that activated the UPR but virtually undetectable in neurons with low mitochondrial activity. In the human brain, strikingly, excitatory neurogranin neurons had the highest mitochondrial activity and triggered the UPR. The selective activation of the UPR only in neurons with high mitochondrial activity is therefore conserved. This study reveals the remarkable dependence on the inherent oxidative metabolic activity of neurons to activate the UPR.

">Novel fat-taste enhancers modulate functional connectivity of the reward system following sustained activation of gustatory pathways in mice</a></h4>

              
                Humans and rodents exhibit an innate preference for dietary fat, and dysfunction of lingual fat-taste receptors CD36 and GPR120 in obesity suggests that impaired oro-sensory lipid detection may contribute to its development. Rodent models with reduced fat-taste sensitivity display increased fat intake, highlighting the role of taste perception in dietary regulation. The newly developed NKS-3 and NKS-5, high-affinity agonists for CD36 and CD36/GPR120 receptors, respectively, induce early fat satiation and reduce both fat-rich food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese mice. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we investigated the response of the reward system to a sustained activation of CD36 and GPR120 via fat-taste enhancers NKS-3 and NKS-5 compared to linoleic acid (LA). Male C57BL/6JRj mice (N=88) received oral administration of vehicle, 0.2% LA, 50 uM NKS-3 or 75 uM NKS-5 for 10 days. The immunohistochemical analysis of cerebral FosB neuronal expression revealed a reorganization of the functional network connectivity. Behavioral assessments over an additional 10-day period in a second cohort of animals detected no adverse motivational, compulsive-like, depressive or anxiogenic effect of the treatments. Our findings suggest that our fat-taste enhancers may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against obesity, leveraging the oral-gut-brain axis to regulate fat-rich food intake.

">Frequency-dependent Inhibition during Deep Brain Stimulation of Thalamic Ventral Intermediate Nuclei</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) has been a standard therapy for essential tremor. It has been shown that high frequency ([&ge;]100Hz) DBS suppresses Vim neuronal firing and tremor activity, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we use in vivo recordings (single-unit) of Vim neurons (n=19, people with essential tremor) during different DBS frequencies to investigate whether neuronal suppression during high-frequency DBS occurs at synaptic/cellular levels (e.g., cell inhibition due to synaptic depression/fatigue during high-frequency DBS) or is influenced by network-level effects (e.g., recurrent inhibition). We propose a theoretical framework that explains DBS effects at both cellular and network levels, i.e., (continuous) high-frequency DBS not only depresses synapses projecting to Vim but also enables the recruitment of inhibitory neurons. A transient burst in the spiking activity of Vim during high-frequency DBS, prior to neuronal suppression, is likely providing sufficient network engagement to recruit inhibitory neurons that are silent during low-frequency DBS. Further, we detected a positive-going evoked-field potential effect, hereafter referred to as quasi-evoked inhibition, during high-frequency (100 Hz and 200 Hz) Vim-DBS in four out of 19 recording sites. Interestingly, it was observed that (i) neuronal suppression is stronger in these four neurons (P < 0.05), implying that inhibitory engagement during high-frequency DBS can further suppress neuronal firing, and (ii) quasi-evoked inhibition emerges after the transient burst (P < 1.00 x 10-7), i.e., the latter may give rise to the former. By removing DBS artifacts with a novel algorithm and characterizing the dynamics of quasi-evoked inhibitory activity, we showed that the likelihood of occurrence of this inhibitory activity negatively correlated with the instantaneous firing rate (P < 1.00 x 10-5). These results suggest that an excitatory-inhibitory balance is likely regulating Vim activities during high-frequency DBS. Our findings shed light on potential network mechanisms underlying Vim-DBS, which can provide insight for optimizing DBS by designing new stimulation patterns.

">Multitasking Recurrent Networks Utilize CompositionalStrategies for Control of Movement</a></h4>

              
                The brain and body comprise a complex control system that can flexibly perform a diverse range of movements. Despite the high-dimensionality of the musculoskeletal system, both humans and other species are able to quickly adapt their existing repertoire of actions to novel settings. A strategy likely employed by the brain to accomplish such a feat is known as compositionality, or the ability to combine learned computational primitives to perform novel tasks. Previous works have demonstrated that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a useful tool to probe compositionality during diverse cognitive tasks. However, the attractor-based computations required for cognition are largely distinct from those required for the generation of movement, and it is unclear whether compositional structure extends to RNNs producing complex movements. To address this question, we train a multitasking RNN in feedback with a musculoskeletal arm model to perform ten distinct types of movements at various speeds and directions, using visual and proprioceptive feedback. The trained network expresses two complementary forms of composition: an algebraic organization that groups tasks by kinematic and rotational structure to enable the flexible creation of novel tasks, and a sequential strategy that stitches learned extension and retraction motifs to produce new compound movements. Across tasks, population activity occupied a shared, low-dimensional manifold, whereas activity across task epochs resides in orthogonal subspaces, indicating a principled separation of computations. Additionally, fixed-point and dynamical-similarity analyses reveal reuse of dynamical motifs across kinematically aligned tasks, linking geometry to mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate rapid transfer to held-out movements via simple input weight updates, as well as the generation of target trajectories from composite rule inputs, without altering recurrent dynamics, highlighting a biologically plausible route to within-manifold generalization. Our framework sheds light on how the brain might flexibly perform a diverse range of movements through the use of shared low-dimensional manifolds and compositional representations.

">Spatiotemporal dynamics of alphaherpesviral latency and reactivation in the murine central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Alphaherpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and Pseudorabies Virus (PrV), establish lifelong latency in the nervous system and can cause recurrent disease. While latency has classically been attributed to peripheral sensory ganglia, accumulating evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) also act as a relevant reservoir for viral latency and reactivation. Here, we investigated the CNS as a site of latency using the attenuated mutant PrV-{Delta}UL21/US3{Delta}kin which reproduces key features of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in female CD1 mice. We mapped brain regions permissive to alphaherpesviral latency and analyzed the temporal dynamics of viral transcription, histopathology, and host clinical and immune responses. Following intranasal inoculation, mice were analyzed at 11 to 14, 21, 28, 42, 105, and 190 days post infection (dpi). To assess the potential of reactivation, a subset received cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone at 170 dpi. Viral transcripts were detected by RNAscope in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR targeting the lytic gene UL19 and the latency-associated transcript (LAT). Histopathological analyses included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry for CD3, Iba1, GFAP, and cleaved caspase-3. Major capsid protein (UL19) expression displayed marked regional and temporal heterogeneity, with prominent signals in mesiotemporal structures (piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex), coinciding with pronounced T-cell infiltration. LAT expression remained overall low, with a transient peak during the acute infection (11-14 dpi). RT-qPCR confirmed high viral transcript levels for both UL19 and LAT in mesiotemporal regions during early infection, while LAT expression returned to baseline levels thereafter. Histopathology demonstrated a transition from acute necrotizing meningoencephalitis to prolonged or recurrent low-grade inflammation, accompanied by glial activation and localized apoptosis. Notably, UL19 expression strongly correlated with CD3+ T-cell infiltration, particularly at 42 dpi. These findings define the spatiotemporal interplay between viral transcriptional activity and neuroinflammation and identify selected CNS regions as reservoirs for latent or recurrent alphaherpesvirus infection.

">Arousal-related mediation of perceptual belief updating across auditory domains</a></h4>

              
                Belief updating refers to the integration of prior beliefs with incoming evidence and guides decision-making under uncertainty. In response to surprising events, this process is thought to be modulated by the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) arousal system, observable via pupil dilations (PDs). Pertinent literature has mostly focused on conscious, high-level decision-making and estimation processes, while assuming that the same principles apply to low-level sensory perceptual decision-making and generalize across tasks, domains and modalities. To address some of these assumptions, we devised a novel perceptual discrimination paradigm, investigating behavior and PDs across auditory domains. Participants were presented with auditory sequences of randomized length at a rapid pace, changing intermittently between two latent states: acceleration vs. deceleration (temporal group, N = 25) and clockwise vs. counterclockwise movement (spatial group, N = 22). Under high uncertainty, participants continuously inferred latent states to report the final state per sequence. To extract per-stimulus estimates of PDs during sequences, we fitted a deconvolution-based general linear model to the continuous pupil traces with a free amplitude parameter reflecting ongoing PDs. A Bayesian observer model was fitted to participants' responses and used to estimate information gain and surprisal for every stimulus. Participants' performance and PDs showed strong sensitivity to the occurrence of change-points. Both computational variables significantly predicted PDs in both domains, with information gain outperforming surprisal in a model comparison. Further model comparison revealed significant preference for models excluding possible domain-specific effects over models including them, pointing towards a constant effect over domains. We conclude that behavior and associated PDs observed in our purely perceptual auditory task align with Bayesian principles of belief updating. The observed lack of domain specificity supports the assumed generalizability of belief updating.

">Coherent dynamics of thalamic head-direction neurons irrespective of input</a></h4>

              
                While the thalamus is known to relay and modulate sensory signals to the cortex, whether it also participates in active computation and intrinsic signal generation remains unresolved. The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. These findings suggest that thalamic circuits are sufficient to generate and maintain coherent population dynamics in the absence of structured input.

">Effects of acute adolescent stress on the acquisition and maintenance of intravenous oxycodone self-administration in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: The persistent threat of the opioid epidemic warrants investigation into risk factors that predispose individuals to opioid use disorder (OUD). Adolescent stress has been linked to enhanced risk for OUD in humans, however attempts to model this preclinically have yielded mixed results. Additionally, few studies have explored whether adolescent stress modulates the reinforcing effects of prescription opioids. Here we investigate the impact of acute adolescent stress on oxycodone self-administration in male and female rats. Methods: Adolescent male and female rats underwent acute restraint stress during concurrent exposure to predator odor, or control handling. Approximately one week later, subjects were allowed to acquire IV oxycodone self-administration (0.03 mg/kg/inf) over 10 sessions (2 h/day) under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. Following three additional FR1 sessions and seven sessions under FR3, rats underwent two progressive-ratio tests (0.03 mg/kg/inf and 0.06 mg/kg/inf, respectively). Separate groups of adolescent rats underwent similar experimental manipulations but were trained on sucrose reinforcement. Results: Adolescent stress did not affect the rate of acquisition of IV oxycodone self-administration. However, oxycodone self-administration escalated during post-acquisition FR1 sessions and remained elevated during FR3 sessions in stressed rats as compared to unstressed controls. Adolescent stress exposure did not affect responding during progressive-ratio tests, nor did it affect any measure of sucrose pellet reinforcement. Conclusions: The present results are the first to demonstrate adolescent stress-induced enhancement of oxycodone reinforcement in rats and provide a preclinical model for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms by which adolescent stress increases vulnerability for prescription opioid misuse.

">VesiclePy: A Machine Learning Vesicle Analysis Toolbox for Volume Electron Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Vesicles are critical components of neurons that package neurotransmitters and neuropeptides for their release, in order to communicate with other neurons and cells. However, due to their small size, the reconstruction of the full vesicle endowment across an entire neuronal morphology remains challenging. To achieve this, we have used, as a tool to identify and visualize vesicles, Volume Electron Microscopy (vEM), a method that has the nanoscale resolution to detect individual vesicle boundaries, content, and 3D locations. However, the large volume of vEM datasets poses a challenge in the segmentation, classification, and spatial analysis of tens of thousands of vesicles and their target cell in 3D. Here we report the development of VesiclePy, an integrated pipeline for automated segmentation, classification, proofreading, and spatial analysis of vesicles, relative to neuron masks in large-volume electron microscopy data. Our package integrates the efficiency of deep learning and the accuracy of human proofreading and provides a streamlined package in chunked processing and accurate indexing, localization, and visualization of single vesicle resolution in large vEM data. We demonstrate the viability of VesiclePy using high-pressure frozen serial EM data of Hydra vulgaris and quantify the performance of the package using ground truth manual annotations. We show that VesiclePy can process a multiterabyte serial EM dataset, efficiently annotate 53,851 vesicles from 20 complete neurons, and classify vesicles into 5 types. Each vesicle has a unique ID and 3D location for further spatial analysis in relation to neuron or non-neuronal targets nearby. Finally, by combining vesicle data and morphological information of each neuron, we can quantitatively cluster neurons into subtypes. VesiclePy is available at https://github.com/PytorchConnectomics/VesiclePy under an MIT license.

">Brain Preparedness for Active Forgetting: Cortisol Awakening Response Proacts Prefrontal Control Over Hippocampal-Striatal Circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Stress-related psychiatric pathologies (e.g., rumination in depression, intrusive memories in PTSD) involve impaired inhibitory control over emotional memories and disrupted cortisol circadian rhythms. However, how these mechanisms interact to support adaptive forgetting remains unclear. Here, by integrating multi-modal neuroendocrine profiling with fMRI-based memory suppression in 90 participants, we demonstrate that the cortisol awakening response (CAR)--a circadian surge priming the brain for daily demands--proactively and selectively enhances suppression of recently acquired but not overnight-consolidated emotional memories. This time-dependent facilitation manifests through dual neural mechanisms: Robust CAR broadly amplifies dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) engagement during suppression attempts and specifically strengthens top-down dlPFC control over hippocampal-striatal circuits exclusively for recent traces. Our findings bridge circadian biology, systems neuroscience, and clinical psychopathology to establish CAR as a neuroendocrine preparedness mechanism that proactively configures adaptive forgetting circuits across sleep-wake cycles, thereby informing circadian-based interventions for stress disorders.

">Spatial transcriptomics of compartmentalised inflammation in a natural disease multiple sclerosis cohort.</a></h4>

              
                Compartmentalised inflammation is a poorly understood aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is associated with worse outcomes and represents an important therapeutic target. To gain deep insight into compartmentalised inflammation, we have taken the approach of digital spatial profiling of the whole human transcriptome in areas of Central Nervous System (CNS) perivascular and meningeal inflammation and tertiary lymphoid-like structures (TLS) in MS. Critically, we had access to rare archival tissue obtained before the era of disease-modifying therapies, representing the natural history of disease. This analysis has identified differentially-expressed genes in TLS compared to meningeal or perivascular inflammation. Pathway analysis highlighted that TLS signalling is dominated by B cell activity including active antibody secretion. Our data demonstrated the diversity of immunoglobulins and the prominence of IgG3- and IgG4-secreting cells in TLS. Intriguingly, our analyses suggest pathways of active viral mRNA translation and associated-cellular responses within TLS immune cells, suggesting TLS may be hubs for viral (re)activation. These findings provide insight into the function of TLS in MS disease pathogenesis, and reveal unique immune signatures that may support biomarker development to predict patients that harbour TLS in life.

">Mesoscopic analysis of GABAergic marker expression in acetylcholine neurons in the whole mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                In the central nervous system, acetylcholine (ACh) neurons coordinate neural network activity required for higher brain functions, such as attention, learning, and memory, as well as locomotion. Disturbances in cholinergic signaling have been described in many diseases of the developing and mature brain. Interestingly, ACh neurons can co-transmit GABA to support essential roles in brain function. However, the contributions of ACh/GABA co-transmission to brain function remain unclear. This underscores the need to better understand the heterogeneity of ACh neurons, particularly the sub-population of ACh neurons co-expressing GABAergic markers. We used various combinations of transgenic mouse lines to systematically label ACh neuron populations positive for different GABAergic markers in the brain. We developed a workflow combining tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, and machine learning to image entire mouse brain hemispheres followed by quantification of ACh neurons throughout the brain. With this approach, we assessed the role of GABA co-transmission in ACh neuron function and quantified ACh and ACh/GABA neuron sub-populations in the brain. Our results suggest that GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons is not required to maintain the regular ACh neuron count in the brain. Furthermore, we report that a large subset of ACh neurons can potentially synthesize GABA by co-expressing the marker Gad2. However, most of these ACh neurons do not express vGAT, which would enable these neurons to release GABA. Taken together, we conclude that GABA co-transmission likely occurs only from a small population of ACh neurons restricted to few brain nuclei.

">Encoding visual stimuli by striatal neurons</a></h4>

              
                To move through the world, animals extract visual features from objects. Although visual object encoding is considered a cortical attribute, subcortical areas also contain visual processing circuits. Using electrophysiological recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) located in a target region of the primary visual cortex, we identified striatal modules that process basic visual features. SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction. These findings indicate parallel visual information processing in basal ganglia circuits, expanding current models of visual perception beyond cortical networks.

                Arousal is essential for survival, and maladaptive arousal processing leads to an inability to focus, anxiety-like behavior, and dysregulated affective states. Norepinephrine (NE) is known to regulate anxiety, arousal, and learning through locus coeruleus (LC) projections throughout the brain. Evidence for co-release of the NE precursor and neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) from LC neurons has been accumulating for years, yet definitive measures of DA release across regions, stimulus paradigms, and behaviors associated with the LC-NE system remain controversial. Here, we identified the physiological and behavioral properties that evoke DA release from LC axon terminals. Using concomitant approaches, we inhibited the LC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to selectively isolate the contributions of LC-derived DA release. Together these findings establish the constraints by which LC neurons release DA in a modality-dependent manner.

">Hypoplasticity in sensory-driven neocortical circuits of the Fragile X syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience and learning are tightly linked to plasticity in neocortical circuits. Repetitive sensory stimulation, such as rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at behaviourally relevant frequencies (8 Hz), can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in typically developing mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenically inherited form of intellectual disability, is associated with altered tactile reactivity, where non-noxious touch can be aversive. To investigate how sensory-evoked plasticity is altered in FXS, we combined ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the Somatosensory (S1) cortex of adult male Fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-/y) mice and typically developing (Fmr1+/y) control littermates. We found that plasticity induced by repetitive sensory stimulation was impaired in Fmr1-/y mice ex and in vivo compared to controls. L4-evoked subthreshold synaptic responses were hyperexcitable in L2/3 PNs, consistent with circuit-level disinhibition. Despite this, baseline intrinsic spiking evoked by current steps remained largely unchanged and whisker-evoked activity appeared diminished in vivo. We observed a shortening of the axon initial segment (AIS) in L2/3 in Fmr1-/y compared to control mice, which may reveal a potential mechanism to explain why subthreshold hyperexcitability did not induce more spiking. We also observed an increase in adaptation to the repetitive stimulation in Fmr1-/y mice compared to controls, which may underlie failure to induce plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that L2/3 PNs of S1 in Fmr1-/y mice are locked in a hypoplastic state, potentially related to disrupted inhibitory control, AIS shortening, and rapid adaptation during repetitive sensory stimulation. As somatosensory processes underly tactile perception, these findings may potentially underly altered tactile reactivity in FXS.

">Encoding of motor sequences in primate globus pallidus and motor cortex: Uniform preference for ordinal position</a></h4>

              
                How the brain organizes discrete actions into fluid sequences is a central problem in motor neuroscience. Competing models of basal ganglia (BG) function propose that BG neurons either signal sequence boundaries or encode movements across ordinal positions. Prior studies have largely examined fixed sequences with end-of-sequence rewards, leaving open whether such findings generalize to more naturalistic conditions. We trained four rhesus macaques to perform a visuomotor sequence task requiring four or five out-and-back joystick movements to peripheral targets. Sequences were completed under two conditions: a random condition, in which target order varied across trials, and a fixed condition, in which order was predictable and consistent. Rewards were delivered after each movement, dissociating reward timing from sequence completion. We recorded single-unit activity in arm-related regions of the globus pallidus (GP; n = 458) and primary motor cortex (M1; n = 306). Regression analyses revealed that many neurons in both GP and M1 encoded ordinal position within a sequence. Order effects were more frequent in the fixed condition, but were also present during random sequences. We found no evidence for preferential encoding of sequence initiation or termination in overlearned sequences, in contrast to prior studies reporting start/stop signals in basal ganglia. Weak effects appeared under the random condition in one animal pair, but these did not generalize across animals or conditions. Instead, neurons exhibited heterogeneous order-related responses spanning the full sequence. These results demonstrate that GP neurons, like those in M1, encode ordinal position throughout a sequence rather than acting solely as sequence initiators or terminators. This challenges boundary-specific models of BG function and highlights a broader role for the BG in representing serial order during motor sequence production.

">Morphological details contribute to neuronal response variability within the same cell type</a></h4>

              
                A large body of literature offers an explanation on how biophysical diversity and variable branching patterns of neurons contribute to degeneracy, and therefore enable multiple solutions for a characteristic neuronal response. The specific influence of finer morphological details, such as diameter and length of dendritic branches, on response variability is yet unclear. In this study, we address this question using a model database approach with spatially extended, conductance-based compartmental models to study variability of response features, such as resting membrane potential, input resistance, spike count, first spike latency, spike height, and spike width. Using 15 reconstructed morphologies of leech touch cells with fixed branching patterns, we identified several thousands of parameter sets that reproduced the experimentally measured response features of all the tested morphologies. Even when the biophysical parameters were kept equal across reconstructed morphologies, variability in response features arose from the morphological details. Systematically varying the distribution of ion channels across the neuronal membrane revealed that all spike response features are influenced by the location of spike initiation zones with higher conductance density. Nevertheless, biologically plausible responses can arise from different locations of spike initiation zones and even homogeneous distribution of ion channels. Furthermore, comparing the simulated spike responses from two morphological subtypes of leech touch cells revealed that the previously published systematic differences cannot be explained by the morphological differences alone. A larger total conductance was required to reproduce the experimental finding of an increased spike count and a larger spike amplitude in a morphological subtype with a larger membrane area. In conclusion, biophysical properties, morphological details, and ion channel distribution across the membrane all interact in their contribution to the functionality and response variability of neurons of the same cell type.

">Spontaneous reinstatement of episodic memories in the developing human brain</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports episodic memories in development, and yet how the brain stabilizes these memories determines their long-term accessibility. This study examined how episodic memories formed in development are stabilized and whether early-life experiences influence the neural mechanisms involved. Using fMRI and multivariate analyses, we tracked neural reinstatement of newly learned item-location-context associations in youth (N = 49; mean age = 11.68 years). Hippocampus and visual cortex activity during encoding predicted later memory success. Crucially, spontaneous reinstatement in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during post-encoding rest also predicted memory. In a second sample (N = 32, mean age = 12.86 years) with early adversity, differential recruitment of the precuneus and visual cortex during encoding, and angular gyrus during reinstatement, was observed. These findings suggest that hippocampus and mPFC contribute to developmental memory stabilization in ways consistent with mature function, while differences in memory accessibility across developmental experiences arise from broader network adaptations.

">Selective genetic targeting of the mouse efferent vestibular nucleus identifies monosynaptic inputs and indicates function as multimodal integrator</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular system is a critical sensory modality required for coordinated movement, balance and our ability to interact with the surrounding environment. Vestibular sensory neurons provide the nervous system with information about head rotation and acceleration. However, the nervous system can also modify the activity of sensory neurons and hair cells via the actions of the efferent vestibular system (EVS). The function of the EVS has remained unknown partly because of an inability to target efferent vestibular neurons in a selective manner to understand their synaptic inputs and function during behaviour. Here, we present a novel method for the selective targeting and expression of flp-recombinase in EVS neurons. We take advantage of the dual expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in these neurons to develop an adeno-associate virus (AAV) that expresses a gene only in neurons with this intersectional expression. We use this system to map the monosynaptic inputs to EVS neurons and show inputs from distinct populations of brainstem and midbrain regions indicating a functional role as a multimodal processing center and integrator for the vestibular periphery. To demonstrate the applicability of our technology in behavioural assays, we performed a preliminary behaviour analysis in mice with disrupted EVS function. While more bespoke assays are required to ascertain EVS function/s, our viral method presents a novel tool for investigators examining the role of the vestibular system and its central circuits.

">The Hippocampus Rapidly Integrates Sequence Representations During Novel Multistep Predictions</a></h4>

              
                Memories for temporally extended sequences can be used adaptively to predict future events on multiple timescales, a function that relies on the hippocampus. For such predictions to be useful, they should be updated when environments change. We investigated how and when new learning shapes hippocampal representations of temporally extended sequences, and how this updating relates to flexible predictions about future events. Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants' ability to update their predictions in behavior. Together, these results advance our understanding of how structured knowledge dynamically emerges in service of adaptive behavior.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the search for EEG markers of human consciousness, alpha power has long been considered a reliable marker which is fundamental for the assessment of unresponsive patients from all etiologies. However, recent evidence questioned the role of alpha power as a marker of consciousness and proposed the spectral exponent and spatial gradient as more robust and generalizable clinical indexes. In this study, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of 303 unresponsive patients and investigated etiology-specific differences in clinical markers of level of consciousness, responsiveness and capacity to recover. We compare a set of candidate EEG makers: i) absolute, relative and flattened alpha power; ii) spatial ratios; iii) the spectral exponent; and iv) signal complexity. Our results support the claim that alpha power has higher diagnostic value for anoxic patients. Meanwhile, the spectral slope showed diagnostic value for non-anoxic patients only. Changes in relative power and signal complexity occurred alongside changes in the spectral slope. Grouping unresponsive patients from different etiologies together can confound or obscure the diagnostic value of different EEG markers of consciousness. Our study highlights the importance of analyzing different etiologies independently and emphasizes the need to develop clinical markers which better account for inter-individual and etiology-dependent differences.</span>

A key factor in the choices is reward-specific satiety, which is the sensory-specific decrease in the reward value of a particular reward when it is consumed to satiety. Another key factor is reward-specific motivation, the increase in the reward value of a reward when it is first provided. Here, we develop the theory based on experimental evidence in humans and other primates, that reward-specific satiety is implemented in orbitofrontal cortex reward value neurons by adaptation in the synapses from visual and taste cortical regions in which the neuronal firing is not influenced by reward-specific satiety. Correspondingly we develop the theory that reward-specific motivation (or incentive motivation) is implemented by shorter-term synaptic facilitation in the same synapses on to orbitofrontal cortex reward value neurons. We complement the theories with an integrate-and-fire neuronal network model of how these reward value computations are performed in the orbitofrontal cortex by synaptic adaptation and synaptic facilitation in the afferent connections to orbitofrontal cortex reward value neurons, to implement a profound influence on behavioral choice that has great adaptive value for humans and many other animals.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Tinnitus is a phantom auditory perception that occurs without an external stimulus. Increasing evidence suggests that it is associated with abnormal predictive coding, in which overly strong priors may give rise to hallucinatory perception, as proposed by the “strong priors” hypothesis. Neurodynamic analysis, by characterizing the temporal evolution of brain activity, can further test the “strong priors” hypothesis in tinnitus, specifically whether tinnitus patients’ brain activity is more influenced by past activity. However, the neurodynamic characteristics of tinnitus remain poorly understood. Therefore, we examined long-range and short-range temporal correlations in resting-state Electroencephalography (EEG) signals from tinnitus patients and healthy controls. We applied detrended fluctuation analysis, lifetimes, and waiting times to assess temporal correlations across multiple time scales. Our results showed that tinnitus patients exhibited stronger temporal correlations in the alpha frequency band, accompanied by heightened long-range dependencies in higher frequency bands. These findings reveal an abnormally enhanced temporal structure across multiple timescales and frequency bands in tinnitus, potentially reflecting an excessive influence of global context on intrinsic information processing and providing support for the “strong priors” hypothesis.</span>

                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for complex experimental workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental workflows, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease representing a global public health concern and is associated with severe complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Although several species of the genus Acalypha have demonstrated biological activity, no prior studies have evaluated the hypoglycemic effect of Acalypha argomuelleri Briq., making this study relevant. Method The hypoglycemic effect of the aqueous leaf extract of A. argomuelleri Briq. (AAAE) was evaluated in an experimental model using Rattus rattus var. albinus. A randomized, prospective design was employed, consisting of a control group and three treatment groups receiving doses of 100, 150, and 300 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Hyperglycemia was induced via oral glucose administration. Results The qualitative phytochemical analysis of AAAE revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols, cardiotonic glycosides, and diterpenes, with no reducing sugars. The 300 mg/kg dose produced a significant and sustained reduction in blood glucose levels, reaching near-normal values at 90 minutes, demonstrating a dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect. Discussion The study confirmed that AAAE has a dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg. This dose showed a faster and more sustained reduction in glucose levels compared to 100 and 150 mg/kg, suggesting higher efficacy at elevated concentrations. The identified flavonoids and phenols, associated with glucose metabolism modulation and pancreatic β-cell protection, likely explain the observed effect. The absence of reducing sugars indicates the hypoglycemic effect is linked to secondary metabolites. Conclusions The AAAE exhibited a significant dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg after 90 minutes. These findings support the potential of A. argomuelleri Briq. as a natural alternative for blood glucose control, though further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in clinical models.

Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (58.0%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background Psychosomatic disorders, characterized by physical symptoms exacerbated or caused by psychological factors, present significant challenges in clinical management. Hypnotherapy, a therapeutic technique that induces a trance-like state to promote focused attention and suggestibility, has shown promise in treating such conditions. This scoping review explores the existing evidence on hypnotherapy’s efficacy in managing psychosomatic disorders. Method A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature for studies published between 2019 and 2025. Keywords included hypnotherapy, psychosomatic disorders, and names of all psychosomatic disorders like asthma, fibromyalgia, and etc. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included, and non professional hypnosis was excluded. Results Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria, covering conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic pain, diabetes, vaginismus. According to a study, hypnotherapy can noticeably lessen anxiety and depression in patients after a few sessions, 1 improve their quality of life 2 and alleviate rumination and other psychological symptoms. 3 Conclusion Hypnotherapy appears to be a viable adjunctive treatment for psychosomatic disorders, though further high-quality research is needed to establish standardized protocols and long-term efficacy.

                <p>Understanding the roles of astrocytic calcium signaling in multiple brain regulatory mechanisms including metabolism, blood flow, neuromodulation, and neuroinflammation has remained one of the enduring challenges in glial biology. To delineate astrocytic contribution from concurrent neuronal activity, it is vital to establish robust control and manipulate astrocytes using a technique like optogenetics due to its high cellular specificity and temporal resolution. The lack of an experimental paradigm to induce controlled calcium signaling in astrocytes has hindered progress in the field. To address this, in this study, we systematically characterize and identify light stimulation paradigms for inducing regulated, on-demand increases in astrocytic calcium in acute brain slice cortical astrocytes from MlC1-ChR2(C128S)-EYFP mice (of either sex). We identified paradigms 20, 40 and 60% (of <I>T</I> = 100&nbsp;s) to elicit robust calcium responses upon periodic stimulations, while the 95% paradigm exhibited a response only during the first stimulation. We also quantified several parameters, including peak height, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and latencies, and observe that the 20% paradigm/duty cycle has the highest peak <I>F</I>/<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB> among the paradigms across all stimulations and the lowest FWHM during the first stimulation. To illustrate the impact of our study, we observed robust changes in cerebral blood flow, because of 20% optogenetic stimulation, in vivo, using laser Doppler flowmetry. Overall, the 20% paradigm is a favorable choice for eliciting robust astrocytic calcium responses in astrocytes while performing periodic stimulations.</p>

                The ever-increasing generation of municipal solid waste remains an environmental and managerial challenge. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of consumer recycling behavior (CRB) is essential for designing effective interventions. This study develops and tests an integrated conceptual model grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Construal Level Theory (CLT), and Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) to explain the motivational dynamics of CRB. Drawing on a cross-sectional survey of a convenient sample of Malaysian university students (N = 508), the model examines how threat and coping appraisals, psychological distance of environmental harm, and individual regulatory focus shape intention to recycle. Structural equation modeling results confirm that both threat appraisal (perceived severity and vulnerability) and coping appraisal (self-efficacy and response efficacy) significantly predict recycling intention, while perceived cost serves as a behavioral barrier. All four dimensions of psychological distance—temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical—negatively predict threat appraisal, with perceived vulnerability showing stronger associations than perceived severity. Mediation analyses reveal that threat appraisal fully mediates the effect of psychological distance on recycling intention. Furthermore, the PORCESS analysis conducted to test moderated mediation hypotheses supports the role of regulatory focus: prevention focus attenuates the impact of psychological distance via severity perception, while promotion focus strengthens it. Findings highlight the interplay between cognitive appraisals, perceived distance, and motivational orientation in shaping pro-environmental intentions, offering actionable insights for the design of targeted recycling campaigns and public communication strategies. Implications for theory and policy, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.

                Background Bayesian methods provide a flexible framework for meta-analysis, particularly for network meta-analysis (NMA), which enables simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions and robust modeling of heterogeneity. However, implementing Bayesian meta-analysis often requires advanced programming skills. Methods We developed BayesMetaNMA, an open-source R/Shiny application for Bayesian pairwise and network meta-analyses. The application uses rjags for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, netmeta for network structure visualization and frequentist NMA outputs, and meta for conventional pairwise analyses. Users can select from various effect measures (standardized mean difference, mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, hazard ratio), set MCMC parameters, and define prior distributions. Outputs include MCMC diagnostics, posterior summaries, study-level estimates, and network-specific analyses such as ranking tables and inconsistency checks. Results BayesMetaNMA produces comprehensive outputs for both pairwise and network models, including convergence diagnostics (trace, density, autocorrelation, Gelman–Rubin plots), pooled and treatment-specific effects, heterogeneity estimates, and optional meta-regression. All plots and summaries are downloadable. Conclusions BayesMetaNMA provides a user-friendly interface for applying Bayesian methods to evidence synthesis without extensive coding. By integrating established R packages in an interactive workflow, it facilitates robust Bayesian analyses for a wide range of research applications.

                Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacterium that poses serious challenges to conventional antibiotic therapy. In this study, a dose-dependent antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) approach was developed using Allura Red in combination with a 630 nm red laser. Four complementary assays were integrated into a unified evaluation platform: AMDA for singlet oxygen, XTT for metabolic activity, CFU enumeration for bacterial viability, and Crystal Violet (CV) staining for biofilm biomass. Results: The Allura Red–mediated PDT demonstrated dose-dependent effects, with 15 J/cm2 yielding ~87% CFU reduction and >75% biofilm inhibition. Conclusion: This study introduces, for the first time, a novel Allura Red–based, multi-assay PDT framework against P. aeruginosa, providing a comprehensive and translational evaluation method. Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacterium that represents a major challenge to conventional antibiotics. Methods In this study, a novel dose-dependent antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) approach was applied using Allura Red combined with red laser light (630 nm) at fluences of 5, 10, and 15 J/cm2. Four complementary assays were integrated into a single protocol: aminophenyl methylene diphosphonate (AMDA) and XTT for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and singlet oxygen detection, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts for bacterial viability, and Crystal Violet (CV) staining for biofilm biomass. All experiments were performed in triplicate with appropriate controls, and statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results Treatment with 15 J/cm2 produced the highest ROS generation and bacterial killing, with CFU counts reduced by approximately 87%, compared to 71% at 10 J/cm2 and 36% at 5 J/cm2. Biofilm inhibition exceeded 76% at the highest dose. Statistical analysis confirmed significant dose-dependent effects across all assays. Conclusion The integrated, multidimensional protocol provides a reliable method for assessing PDT efficacy and offers valuable insight into the relationship between oxidative stress, bacterial inactivation, and biofilm disruption. This strategy represents a promising approach against biofilm-associated and drug-resistant pathogens.

                Background The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste poses environmental and sustainability challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature and limited disposal options. Repurposing PET as aggregates in structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) offers a dual benefit of waste valorisation and conservation of natural resources, while supporting circular economy objectives. Methods Eight experimental mix proportions of SLWC were developed using a factorial design approach, with water–to–cement ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. PET aggregates were produced via thermal–mechanical processing and subjected to calcium hypochlorite treatment to improve surface bonding with cement paste. Standard tests were conducted to determine workability (Vebe time), fresh and dry densities, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water absorption. Structural efficiency was also computed as a strength-to-weight performance indicator. Results The fresh and dry densities of the PET-based SLWC ranged from 1455–1515 kg/m3 and 1490–1537 kg/m3, respectively, corresponding to category D1.6 lightweight concrete. Compressive strengths ranged between 14.1 and 16.5 MPa, fulfilling the LC13 classification for structural applications. Splitting tensile strengths were between 0.84 and 1.4 MPa, with several mixes achieving minimum thresholds for structural performance. Water absorption values ranged from 4.66% to 10.16%, remaining within international standards for lightweight concrete durability. Workability was low (Vebe times 13–40 s), attributed to the angular and hydrophobic properties of PET aggregates. Structural efficiency values of 9.5–10.9 kPa·m3/kg exceeded minimum international requirements. Conclusions This study confirms that PET aggregates can be successfully utilised to produce structurally viable and durable lightweight concrete. Although workability is reduced, the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, and durability criteria align with international standards. These results demonstrate a sustainable strategy for PET waste valorisation in construction, contributing to resource conservation, reduced environmental burden, and advancement of circular economy goals.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled ventures are reshaping clinical practice by extending diagnostic, triage, and telehealth capabilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Problem Despite rapid startup activity, rigorous evidence of tangible, equitable impact and cost-effectiveness in routine LMIC care remains limited; unresolved concerns include data privacy, algorithmic bias, interoperability, and governance. Research Objectives To assess how AI-driven healthcare entrepreneurship transforms access, quality, and affordability in clinical practice, and to surface enablers, barriers, and ethical implications. RQs (1) Where and how are entrepreneurial AI tools integrated into clinical workflows? (2) What measured effects on access, quality, efficiency, and costs are reported? (3) Which infrastructural, human-capital, and policy factors enable or impede adoption? (4) How are ethics—privacy, bias, explainability, accountability—addressed, and what frameworks are needed? Methodology Mixed-methods secondary synthesis combining a systematic literature review with NLP-assisted evidence mining (>200 records; 87 deeply reviewed), triangulation of quantitative indicators (workforce, connectivity, investment) with qualitative case evidence (WHO and policy reports), interpreted through Diffusion of Innovation, Resource-Based View, and Principlism lenses. Results Startups deploy AI triage chatbots (as reflected in our aggregation of secondary sources described in §§3.2–3.3), portable imaging/diagnostics, telemedicine platforms, and supply-chain tools that can broaden coverage, speed diagnosis, and streamline workflows. Yet real-world evaluations are few; cost-effectiveness is context-dependent; adoption is uneven due to infrastructure gaps, limited/biased local data, interoperability frictions, and trust barriers. Success correlates with workflow fit, VRIO resources (data, talent, partnerships), local co-design, and human-in-the-loop, explainable models. Emerging evidence points to faster emergency logistics, expanded screening reach, and reduced wait times, but definitive outcome and economic endpoints remain scarce. Conclusion AI entrepreneurship can augment clinicians and improve service delivery but is not a panacea. Implication To realize equitable system-level gains, stakeholders should invest in digital public goods and representative datasets, build clinician and data-science capacity, operationalize WHO-aligned governance (privacy, bias audits, explainability, accountability), ensure reimbursement pathways beyond pilots, and scale through public-private and civil-society partnerships.

                Introduction Increased work pressure, lifestyle modifications, and deteriorated living conditions brought on by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can exacerbate mental health concerns such as anxiety, sleeplessness, depression, and stress-related illnesses. Recent studies have shown that a high burden of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attacks, impulsivity, irrational anger, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts, may be experienced by COVID-19 survivors. Due to differences in their susceptibility to infection and lifestyle factors, people with different medical conditions and social roles may have various kinds and severities of mental health problems. This study aimed to provide essential insights into the prevalence, types, and linkages of various mental health issues to improve patient outcomes, guide future treatments, and advance holistic well-being. Methodology This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of common mental health issues among patients receiving treatment at Ayurvedic health centers in Udupi Taluk. Five Ayurvedic centers were chosen randomly from 275 Ayurvedic centers registered in Udupi Taluk. A total of 423 patients aged 18 years and above were selected for this study. The Perceived Stress Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to collect data. Results and discussion The study revealed the presence of some level of perceived stress and depression among the participants. The factor associated with stress was the educational status of participants (p =0.01). The comparison between different stress levels revealed that moderate stress levels were significantly higher among participants with a lower educational status. Conclusion According to a study on perceived stress levels and educational status, participants with lower educational status reported feeling more stressed than those with higher educational status.

                Abstract Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively.

This study investigates whether examining the shape of arterial pulse waves and fitting to them a physiology-based mathematical model of pulse wave propagation can provide additional insights into the state of the cardiovascular system in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), potentially enhancing vasopressor dosing strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study on 25 sTBI patients in an intensive care unit. Arterial pulse waves were recorded non-invasively from wrists and ankles using an oscillometric method and were used to inform a 0-1D model of the arterial blood ﬂow dynamics. Model-estimated, patient-specific cardiovascular parameters were then used in a statistical model to predict changes in the administered dose of vasopressor (norepinephrine) in the next 24 hours. The model fits to the recorded pulse waves were satisfactory, with the coefficients of determination (R2) of approximately 0.9 and the differences between the measured and model-estimated mean arterial pressure of 0.1 ± 1.0 mmHg (R2=0.99). Except for a few patients, we found no clear association between the model-estimated parameters and norepinephrine dose at the time of pulse wave recording. Nevertheless, our predictive model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.85 when trained and tested on the entire dataset and 0.76 when using the leave-one-out cross-validation, with 8 misclassifications among the total of 77 observations. Thus, despite the known inter-patient variability of hemodynamic response to vasopressors, the proposed method allowed predicting the direction of norepinephrine dose changes in the next 24 hours with satisfactory accuracy. Subject to further studies and extensive validation, our approach could inform a decision-support tool for optimizing vasopressor dosing on a per-patient basis.

                <p>by Veronica Pisu, Erich W. Graf, Wendy J. Adams</p>

In the size-weight illusion (SWI), the smaller of two same-weight, same apparent material objects is perceived as heavier. The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via ‘likelihood repulsion’. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and/ or density and/ or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a large difference between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well described by a model (R<sup>2</sup> =.98) that includes a positive influence of both objects’ weights and the judged object’s density, but a negative influence of the other object’s density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero/ small weight differences than for large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that density affects perceived weight to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our descriptive model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.

                <p>by Samuel Cure, Florian G. Pflug, Simone Pigolotti</p>

Epidemic models on complex networks are widely used to assess how the social structure of a population affects epidemic spreading. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for simulating epidemic spreading on both static and temporal weighted networks. We find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with millions of nodes on a standard computer. It also permits simulating a broad range of epidemic models on temporal networks, including scenarios in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. NEXT-Net is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. These features make our algorithm an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.

                <p>by Marco Garcia Noceda, Gargi Kher, Shikhar Uttam, John P. Barton</p>

Drug treatment can control HIV-1 replication, but it cannot cure infection. This is because of a long-lived population of quiescent infected cells, known as the latent reservoir (LR), that can restart active replication even after decades of successful drug treatment. Many cells in the LR belong to highly expanded clones, but the processes underlying the clonal structure of the LR are unclear. Understanding the dynamics of the LR and the keys to its persistence is critical for developing an HIV-1 cure. Here we develop a quantitative model of LR dynamics that fits available patient data over time scales spanning from days to decades. We show that the interplay between antigenic stimulation and clonal heterogeneity shapes the dynamics of the LR. In particular, we find that large clones play a central role in long-term persistence, even though they rarely reactivate. Our results could inform the development of HIV-1 cure strategies.

                <p>by Matthias Bruhns, Jan T. Schleicher, Maximilian Wirth, Marcello Zago, Sepideh Babaei, Manfred Claassen</p>

Highly multiplexed single-cell imaging technologies have revolutionized our ability to capture spatial protein expression at the single-cell level, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of tissue organization and function. However, these advancements rely on accurate cell segmentation, which defines cell boundaries to generate expression profiles. Despite its importance, there is a gap in quantifying how segmentation inaccuracies propagate through analytical pipelines, particularly affecting cell clustering and phenotyping. We introduce a framework that uses affine transformations to simulate realistic segmentation errors. Our approach mimics the variations induced by segmentation algorithms, allowing us to evaluate the robustness of downstream analyses under controlled perturbation conditions. We show that even moderate segmentation errors can significantly distort estimated protein profiles and disrupt cellular neighborhood relationships in feature space. Effects are most pronounced in clustering analyses, where both unsupervised k-Means and graph-based Leiden algorithms exhibit reduced consistency with increasing perturbation — especially with smaller neighborhood sizes. Similarly, cell phenotyping via Gaussian Mixture Models is adversely impacted, with higher levels of segmentation error leading to notable misclassifications between closely related cell types. These results highlight the importance of ensuring high-quality segmentation and careful data processing strategies to mitigate spurious results for downstream analysis tasks. Considering segmentation inaccuracies, possibly in a probabilistic modeling framework, will improve the reliability and reproducibility of findings in multiplexed tissue imaging studies.

                <p>by Zoe Nahas, Anthony John Bridgen, Torkel E. Loman, Jean Dillon, Katie Abley, Dora L. Cano-Ramirez, Fabrizio Ticchiarelli, Madeleine Seale, James C. W. Locke, Ottoline Leyser</p>

As part of their modular development, plants continuously adapt their shoot branching architecture according to environmental conditions. This occurs by regulating the activity of axillary buds established in each leaf axil. Whether a bud grows into a shoot depends partly on the presence of other active shoots, which can inhibit bud activation. This systemic coordination is proposed to be mediated by the transport network of the plant hormone auxin, with buds competing to establish sustained transport of auxin, termed canalized auxin transport, into the main stem. A second hormone, strigolactone, tunes this competition by influencing the removal of the PIN1 auxin export protein from the plasma membrane, and hence the dynamics of canalization. Strigolactone also regulates the expression of another key regulatory hub, the bud-expressed transcription factor <i>BRANCHED1</i> (<i>BRC1</i>). The interplay between auxin transport and BRC1 in regulating bud activity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this interplay in the context of competition between buds, using Arabidopsis explants with two axillary buds as a minimal system. Using experimental data, we develop a mathematical model of bud-bud competition in which BRC1 influences the establishment of canalized auxin transport by regulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. We identify single model parameters that plausibly correspond to the dual impact of strigolactone on <i>BRC1</i> expression and PIN1. We show that modulating these two parameters reproduces the dynamics of bud growth and bud-bud competition observed in relevant mutants and treatments. Our model produces testable hypotheses, which we validate by generating a chimeric PIN1 auxin transporter with impaired strigolactone sensitivity, helping us uncouple the effects of strigolactone on PIN1 and BRC1. These results support the hypothesis that BRC1 influences local bud competitiveness by downregulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. Together with the systemic feedbacks in the auxin transport network, this enables plants to adjust dynamically the number and location of growing branches.

                <p>by Kiran Pandey, Hui Xian Poh, Samie R. Jaffrey</p>

The conversion of adenosine to <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification made to eukaryotic mRNA and is involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. When dysregulated, m6A has been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer. Unlike other RNA methyltransferases, m6A conversion is catalyzed by a multi-protein writer complex with only one catalytic subunit. So why is the m6A writer complex composed of so many proteins? This Unsolved Mystery explores the possible functions of the proteins of the m6A writer complex and discusses why it might require multiple subunits. Understanding the roles of these proteins could provide insight into how m6A is regulated and reveal new strategies for targeting diseases linked to m6A dysregulation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by variants in the gene <i>DARS2. DARS2</i> is an essential and ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of aspartate to its cognate tRNA for mitochondrial protein translation. LBSL is clinically characterized by progressive spasticity, ataxia, and dorsal column dysfunction, and is considered a primary axonopathy with secondary demyelination.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Herein, we tested the efficacy of gene supplementation, using adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 (AAV9)-<i>DARS2</i> in LBSL patient cells, as well as in an LBSL mouse phenolog in which <i>Dars2</i> was deleted in CamKIIα-expressing neurons of the hippocampus and cortex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>In vitro</i>, patient neurons treated with AAV9-<i>DARS2</i> showed increased gene expression of the gene mirrored by improved mitochondrial function, axonal growth, and reduced lactate release, despite variation in impairment across lines. Knockout mice showed improved behavior and reduced cortical neurodegeneration 6 months after a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV9-<i>DARS2</i>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together, this work provides proof-of-concept data that gene supplementation can improve cell function and survival for an extended period of time. AAV9 therapy has proven especially useful for loss of function monogenetic disorders, and these data may support further investigation into therapies for LBSL. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Under-vehicle blast (UVB) generated from landmines is a unique traumatic brain injury (TBI) mechanism affecting warfighters. UVB hyperacceleration can result in injury independent of impact; however, a secondary impact injury can also occur. To date, translation of findings from rodent TBI models to improved patient outcomes has been unsuccessful, perhaps due to neuroanatomical differences between humans and rodents, including white-to-gray matter ratio and cortical gyrification. To address this modeling difference, a UVB model was developed in ferrets, the brains of which more closely resemble humans. Male ferrets underwent UVB-alone (Blast), controlled cortical impact (CCI)-alone, combined UVB + CCI (BCCI), or craniotomy (Sham) procedures. Neurobehavioral assays were optimized and used to assess mood, memory, and motor control. Blast and BCCI ferrets underwent neuroimaging at baseline and 7 days post-injury. All ferrets were euthanized by terminal perfusion with paraformaldehyde on day 7 for histologic analysis. Results indicate that UVB alters cortical metabolites and induces blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. CCI leads to BBB disruption and cortical diffuse axonal injury, but this is not exacerbated by combination with UVB. BCCI does result in several alterations in key cortical metabolites indicative of increased neuronal injury, oxidative stress, and glial activation as well as impaired neurotransmission and energy generation. Additionally, BCCI significantly increases hyperactivity and impairs spatial memory. Anxiety-like behavior, mood, and motor function approached statistical significance. Taken together, we provide a military-relevant model of UVB in a gyrencephalic animal, the ferret, that may be applied in future investigations into TBI pathophysiology and potential treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-920/v1?src=rss">Exploring simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students: A Qualitative Study in the United Arab Emirates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The nursing profession is increasingly appealing to male students at the undergraduate level. Society’s demand for nurses, particularly male nurses, is rising; nevertheless, the availability of clinical placements for nursing students is insufficient to meet this demand. Simulation has significantly advanced as an educational method for training healthcare personnel. Simulation makes replicating real-life events and honing skills like clinical decision-making and communication. Using simulation as an adjunct or alternative to clinical practice is now under discussion. Simulation is a resource-intensive pedagogical approach, necessitating careful consideration of its organization and implementation to maximize efficiency without undermining learning outcomes. Objective This study aimed to explore simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students in the United Arab Emirates. Method This study adopted a descriptive qualitative approach. The purposive sampling method recruited 43 male students from nursing programs in the University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the individual interviews. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted on an online meeting platform. Data analysis was done using thematic analysis. Results In this study, we identified four major themes: 1) Students’ perceptions of simulation, 2) Preparation for realistic situations, 3) Feeling of anxiety and stress, and 4) Theory and practice abilities gaps. Conclusion The study findings indicate that male nursing students received the overall simulation experience well. The study highlights the importance of skilled and encouraging simulation instructors who can provide participants with valuable guidance and feedback for more individualized teaching. Study results provide important new information about how simulation-based learning could improve nursing education and further studies in this field. The findings shed light on the problems that male nursing students have been dealing with for years and highlight efforts to make changes as soon as feasible. It may be helpful to revise the simulation to provide more opportunities for independent problem-solving skills and to incorporate more real-life factors and variables into the scenario. Additionally, developing more individualized approaches to building self-confidence may be helpful, such as providing personalized feedback and guidance based on each student’s strengths and weaknesses.

Free, online webinar platforms offer a powerful way to democratize scientific knowledge and support career development globally. Drawing from our experience building Open Box Science — a not-for-profit grassroots organization that has hosted over 250 webinars for audiences from more than 70 countries — and examining other successful initiatives, we share practical insights on how to build thriving communities for scientific exchange and call for the continuous support of such platforms. We also highlight how early-career scientists can leverage such platforms to expand their network and enrich their perspectives.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95557">Crosslinking by ZapD drives the assembly of short FtsZ filaments into toroidal structures in solution</a></h4>

              
                Cell division in <i>Escherichia coli</i> relies on the Z ring, a cytoskeletal structure that acts as a scaffold for the assembly of the divisome. To date, the detailed mechanisms underlying the assembly and stabilization of the Z ring remain elusive. This study highlights the role of the FtsZ-associated protein (Zap) ZapD in the assembly and stabilization of Z-ring-like structures via filament crosslinking. Using cryo-electron tomography and biochemical analysis, we show that, at equimolar concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, ZapD induces the formation of toroidal structures composed of short, curved FtsZ filaments that are crosslinked vertically, but also laterally and diagonally. At higher concentrations of ZapD, regularly spaced ZapD dimers crosslink FtsZ filaments from above, resulting in the formation of straight bundles. Despite the simplicity of this reconstituted system, these findings provide valuable insights into the structural organization and stabilization of the Z ring by Zap proteins in bacterial cells, revealing the key role of optimal crosslinking density and geometry in enabling filament curvature and ring formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107451">SETD2 suppresses tumorigenesis in a KRASG12C-driven lung cancer model, and its catalytic activity is regulated by histone acetylation</a></h4>

              
                Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is a key chromatin modification that regulates fundamental physiological and pathological processes. In humans, SETD2 is the only known enzyme that catalyzes H3K36me3 in somatic cells and is implicated in tumor suppression across multiple cancer types. While there is considerable crosstalk between the SETD2-H3K36me3 axis and other epigenetic modifications, much remains to be understood. Here, we show that Setd2 functions as a potent tumor suppressor in a KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse model, and that acetylation enhances SETD2 in vitro methylation of H3K36 on nucleosome substrates. In vivo, Setd2 ablation accelerates lethality in an autochthonous KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven LUAD mouse tumor model. Biochemical analyses reveal that polyacetylation of histone tails in a nucleosome context promotes H3K36 methylation by SETD2. In addition, monoacetylation exerts position-specific effects to stimulate SETD2 methylation activity. In contrast, mono-ubiquitination at various histone sites, including at H2AK119 and H2BK120, does not affect SETD2 methylation of nucleosomes. Together, these findings provide insight into how SETD2 integrates histone modification signals to regulate H3K36 methylation and highlights the potential role of SETD2-associated epigenetic crosstalk in cancer pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103771">Horizontally transferred cell-free chromatin particles function as autonomous ‘satellite genomes’ and vehicles for transposable elements within host cells</a></h4>

              
                Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important evolutionary role in prokaryotes, but it is less frequent in mammals. We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells that circulate in human blood - are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear. We treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immunofluorescence, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. We discovered that the internalised cfChPs were almost exclusively comprised of non-coding DNA, and the disparate DNA sequences contained within them had randomly combined to form complex concatemers, some of which were multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers autonomously performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome such as DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. They harboured human LINE-1 and <i>Alu</i> elements, with the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. Our results suggest that a cell simultaneously harbours two autonomous genome forms: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes). The satellite genomes may have evolutionary functions given their ability to serve as vehicles for transposable elements and to generate a plethora of novel proteins. Our results also suggest that ‘within-self’ HGT may occur in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as ‘foreign’ genetic elements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97461">The success of artificial selection for collective composition hinges on initial and target values</a></h4>

              
                Microbial collectives can perform functions beyond the capability of individual members. Enhancing collective functions through artificial selection is, however, challenging. Here, we explore the ‘rafting-a-waterfall’ metaphor where achieving a target population composition depends on both target and initial compositions. Specifically, collectives comprising fast-growing (F) and slow-growing (S) individuals were grown for ‘maturation’ time, and the collective with S-frequency closest to the target value is chosen to ‘reproduce’ via inoculating offspring collectives. During collective maturation, intra-collective selection acts like a waterfall, relentlessly driving the S-frequency to lower values, while during collective reproduction, inter-collective selection resembles a rafter striving to reach the target frequency. Using simulations and analytical calculations, we show that intermediate target S frequencies are the most challenging, akin to a target within the vertical drop of a waterfall, rather than above or below it. This arises because intra-collective selection is the strongest at intermediate S-frequencies, which can overpower inter-collective selection. While achieving a low target S frequencies is consistently feasible, attaining high target S-frequencies requires an initially high S-frequency — much like a raft that can descend but not ascend a waterfall. As Newborn size increases, the region of achievable target frequency is reduced until no frequency is achievable. In contrast, the number of collectives under selection plays a less critical role. In scenarios involving more than two populations, the evolutionary trajectory must navigate entirely away from the metaphorical ‘waterfall drop.’ Our findings illustrate that the strength of intra-collective evolution is frequency-dependent, with implications in experimental planning.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78031?af=R">Identification of New KCNT1‐Epilepsy Drugs by In Silico, Cell, and Drosophila Modeling</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hyperactive KCNT1 potassium channels, caused by gain-of-function mutations, are associated with a range of epilepsy disorders. Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and, in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1 epilepsies, but suppressing overactive channels poses a potential strategy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the KCNT1 channel structure we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to inhibit channel activity. Cellular KCNT1 channel inhibition was analyzed using electrophysiology and <i>Drosophila</i> bang-sensitive assays were used to analyze seizure suppression. Brain penetration of one drug was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a mouse.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with 4 drugs showing significant reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes. The action of the 4 drugs was then analyzed in vivo and 2 were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized <i>Drosophila</i> KCNT1 epilepsy models. One drug, antrafenine, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a known drug, antrafenine, that reduces KCNT1 channel activity, reduces seizure activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, and crosses the blood–brain barrier in the mouse, suggesting its potential applicability as a new treatment for KCNT1 epilepsy. The sequential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo mechanism-based drug selection strategy used here may have broader application for other human disorders where a disease mechanism has been identified.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78032?af=R">Behavior Decoding Delineates Seizure Microfeatures and Associated Sudden Death Risks in Mouse Models of Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Behavior and motor manifestations are distinctive yet often overlooked features of epileptic seizures. Seizures can result in transient disruptions in motor control, often organized into specific behavioral sequences that can inform seizure types, onset zones, and outcomes. However, refined analysis of behaviors in epilepsy remains challenging. Current manual video inspection approaches are subjective, time-consuming, and often overlook the intricate behavioral dynamics and action kinematics. This study investigates whether artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools can unravel complex behavior repertoire that can delineate seizure outcomes in a data-driven manner.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized two AI-aided tools, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Behavioral Segmentation of Open Field in DLC (B-SOiD), to decode underexplored behavior and action domains of induced seizures in a population of 32 inbred mouse strains that mimic human genetic diversity and a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our automated behavior classification tool identified 63 interpretable behavior groups. Analysis of these behavior groups demonstrates significant differential behavior usage and complexity that can delineate distinct seizure states, unravel intrinsic seizure progression over time, and inform mouse sex, strain backgrounds, and specific pathogenic mutations. We also identified seizure behavior transition dynamics and action/subaction kinematics, like hindlimb motions, that can determine the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These behavior microfeatures can facilitate preclinical mechanistic studies and antiseizure medication screening at scales. These findings also underscore the translational potential of video-based seizure behavior decoding in both inpatient and outpatient settings, including analyzing videos captured by home surveillance devices and ubiquitous smartphones.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/9/ENEURO.0034-25.2025?rss=1">Depression Levels Are Associated with Reduced Capacity to Learn to Actively Avoid Aversive Events in Young Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Depression and anxiety are often characterized by altered reward-seeking and avoidance, respectively. Yet less is known about the relationship between depressive symptoms and specific avoidance behaviors. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates and online workers completed an uninstructed go/no-go avoidance task (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 465) as a reverse translation of a rodent paradigm. Participants exhibited a wide range of symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), ranging from low to severe. In Study 1, cues were used to signal the response type (go/active vs no-go/inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Higher depressive scores were associated with poorer acquisition of active avoidance in undergraduates. Overall participants showed lower accuracy for active than inhibitory avoidance. To examine whether the better no-go trial performance reflected a prepotent response to avoid aversive outcomes, in Study 2, undergraduates (<I>N</I><SUB>Total</SUB> = 330) completed a version of the task that included reward-seeking. Here all participants showed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, consistent with a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. These findings suggest that in young adults, depressive symptoms are associated with difficulty in overriding prepotent responses to actively avoid aversive outcomes in the absence of reward. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that could guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) imposes a significant global health burden, yet effective treatments remain limited. There are no well-characterized, AUD-relevant, rodent biological sample repositories to support research in this area. To address this gap, we established the Alcohol Biobank, a comprehensive resource containing thousands of samples from over 700 (half males, half females) genetically diverse heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Modeled after two successful cocaine and oxycodone biobanks, this repository uses the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) model, paired with oral self-administration, to characterize AUD-like behaviors, including ethanol consumption, preference, motivation, and withdrawal symptoms such as allodynia and anxiety-like behavior. Longitudinal samples (blood, urine, and feces) are collected before, during, and after ethanol exposure, while tissue samples (brain, heart, kidneys, liver, cecum, reproductive organs, adrenal glands, blood) are obtained at intoxication, acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence, or from naive controls. Samples are preserved via snap-freezing or paraformaldehyde fixation to support diverse applications, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and neuroanatomy. Samples are freely available to nonprofit organizations at <A HREF="www.alcoholbiobank.org">www.alcoholbiobank.org</A>. Genetic and behavioral data about these rats are deposited in public repositories. The Alcohol Biobank facilitates collaborative research to uncover biomarkers and develop novel therapies for AUD, addressing a critical need in addiction science.</p>

                <p>Aversion modulation is a key component of hedonic processing, and its dysfunction is evident in psychiatric illnesses. The infralimbic cortex (IL) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) pathway is essential in hedonic processing in rodents but operates differentially across sex, with beta (20&nbsp;Hz) oscillatory activity involved in learned aversion in male but not female rats. In this study, we used taste reactivity (TR) and electrophysiology to examine the role of high gamma (80&nbsp;Hz) activity in affect modulation, specifically innate (quinine) and learned (conditioned taste aversion, CTA) aversion, in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in males showed no changes in IL or NAcSh activity, or in IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity, in the high gamma frequency band during innate or learned aversion. In contrast, in females, quinine elicited an increase in IL and NAcSh 80&nbsp;Hz LFP activity and IL-&gt;NAcSh functional connectivity. Interestingly, LFP directionality analyses in females indicated that top-down modulation from IL to NAcSh was associated with innate aversive behavior expression. To confirm a causal link of 80&nbsp;Hz activity in aversion processing in females, optogenetics was used. Here, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway did not affect learned (CTA) aversion but it selectively decreased innate (quinine) aversion. Collectively, these results highlight sex- and frequency-specific differences in aversion modulation by the IL-&gt;NAcSh pathway, with high gamma frequencies involved in modulating innate aversion, specifically in female rats.</p>

                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. We report a case which had been misdiagnosed at three different healthcare centers before receiving the correct diagnosis and management. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Set (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-417/v5?src=rss">Analysis of prescription pattern and adverse drug reactions of drugs used in Urinary Tract Infection in reproductive age group (15-44 years) women in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Central India: An observational retrospective study [version 5; peer review: </a></h4>

              
                Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent bacterial infection among women of reproductive age. Inappropriate and irrational prescribing of antibiotics—such as the use of unapproved fixed-dose combinations or empirical broad-spectrum therapy—has contributed to growing antimicrobial resistance. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) further complicate treatment outcomes, yet remain underreported, especially in routine outpatient practice. Therefore, an assessment of current prescribing patterns is essential to promote rational drug use. Additionally, evaluation of adverse drug reactions remains important for patient safety and pharmacovigilance. Objectives • To describe the prescribing patterns of drugs used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) among women of reproductive age (15–44 years). • To evaluate the incidence, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as documented in hospital records. • To assess the prescription of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) and combination antimicrobial therapy in relation to standard treatment guidelines (WHO, NLEM 2022). Methods This is a retrospective observational study based on outpatient department (OPD) prescriptions for women aged 15–44 years diagnosed with community-acquired, uncomplicated UTIs at a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Data from 139 prescription records will be retrieved from the medical record section and analyzed. Prescribing indicators, documented ADRs, and use of FDCs will be assessed against national guidelines using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis.

                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background A. catechu (Areca catechu Linn.; A. catechu) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Dendrathema grandiflora (chrysanthemum; D. grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared A. catechu and D. grandiflora polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (20% A. catechu:80% D. grandiflora), F2 (50% A. catechu:50% D. grandiflora), F3 (80% A. catechu:20% D. grandiflora), and normal group. Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenase assay, high concentration of A. catechu (F3) induced the abundant of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions The combination of A. catechu and D. grandiflora extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background The conventional preanesthetic evaluation process can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Preanesthetic questionnaires have been proposed to alleviate the burden on clinical resources. This study aimed to assess the reliability and predictive accuracy of a pediatric preanesthetic screening questionnaire as a potential alternative to the standard preanesthetic consultation. Methods An evaluative, prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted from October 2022 to May 2023 in the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Anesthesiology, Habib Thameur Hospital, Tunis. A 43-item bilingual (French/Arabic) paper-based questionnaire was completed for 300 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) scheduled for elective surgery. Responses were compared with standard preanesthetic evaluations by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) for agreement. Results All 300 patients completed the questionnaire (completion rate = 100%). Most were classified as ASA Physical Status I (78.3%). Agreement between questionnaire responses and physician assessments was excellent for 34 of 43 items (κ > 0.8; p < 0.001), with perfect agreement (κ = 1.000; p < 0.001) for item 10. Near-perfect agreement was observed for ASA classification (κ = 0.953; p < 0.001; concordance rate = 98.3%). Eight items had κ values between 0.397 and 0.798, and one item (myopathy) could not be analyzed due to uniformly negative responses. Conclusion The pediatric preanesthesia questionnaire demonstrated high reliability and strong agreement with physician assessments. It may serve as an effective triage tool to optimize outpatient workflows and reduce clinical workload, particularly for low-risk pediatric patients.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

                Background Synthetic cells have emerged as promising tools for targeted, efficient, and sustainable environmental cleanup, and there is a growing need to understand not only their technical potential but also the biosafety, biosecurity, and governance implications of their deployment in natural ecosystems. Despite their innovative promise, there are currently no standardized global frameworks to assess and manage their risks, particularly those concerning ecological disruption, misuse, and public acceptance. Therefore, this study explored the dual nature of synthetic cells as a tool for ecological restoration. Method This study conducted stakeholder perception analysis through seven expert interviews and surveys involving 70 respondents, primarily from academia and the environmental policy sector. Thematic analysis was used to extract the key concerns. Results Stakeholders highlighted the strong support for the potential of technology in pollutant degradation and climate mitigation. However, major concerns have emerged regarding unintended gene transfer, containment failure, dual-use risks, and a lack of international regulation. The thematic analysis revealed the need for risk assessment strategies, containment measures, and regulatory oversight. Conclusion Recommendations include the development of standardized risk assessment protocols, lifecycle containment strategies, transparent public engagement, and international collaboration. Policymakers must act early to ensure that the environmental benefits of this emerging technology can be realized while mitigating the associated risks.

                This paper’s main purpose is to systematically review both theoretical and empirical literature about the relationship between corporate governance variables and the performance of microfinance institutions. The theoretical reviews were: agency theory, stakeholders’ theory, resource dependency theory, stewardship theory, and social contract theory, which deal with corporate governance mechanism and their effect on the firm’s performance. Empirical studies carried out in different countries at different times together with other findings, were reviewed to compare the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of microfinance institutions and to establish areas of gaps for further studies. Board characteristics, which include size, education, meeting frequency, board composition, and board independence, and their effect on the financial performance of microfinance institutions were discussed. The findings of the study reveal that sound corporate governance improves the performance of Microfinance Institutions. The findings of different scholars show a lack of consistency on the effect of corporate governance variables on the financial performance of Microfinance Institutions, so further investigation is required from potential scholars. Finally, theoretical, measurement, and methodological drawbacks of previous studies were identified, and significant recommendations were forwarded for future studies in this area.

                Gamification has become relevant in the field of higher education, facilitating the teaching and learning process. There are studies that show a positive relationship between gamification and academic performance. A systematic literature review was developed, applying the prism method and using three databases: Scopus, WOS and Scielo. The results indicate a notorious orientation of the studies towards quantitative research. Ninety-two percent of the selected documents have students as their population, while 6% are oriented to teachers and 2% to both. In the more in-depth results, it can be demonstrated that gamification is linked to the generation of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance in the context of higher education. The analysis of theoretical structures reveals that the most relevant approaches for the study of gamification are self-determination and gamified learning. It is also evident that there is a positive relationship between gamification and motivation in learning processes, which allows encouraging the development of critical thinking and the improvement of academic performance.

                Background Latest technological developments make it possible to extract unstructured data from the online world, enabling researchers to uncover important correlations between cyberspace and real space in order to evaluate urban environments. Instagram, by its geotag and hashtag features, provides a formidable database of the sort, in which user activity can strongly impact the salience of material loci. The study aimed at determining and calculating the Tehran Book Garden urban space’s popularity by using the #bookgarden hashtag and geolocations of the active Instagram userbase. Techniques The data were gathered on Instagram via the Application Programming Interface (API) and then analyzed via spatial networking on geographical mappings. Key variables included the geo-coordinate positions of posts, concentration of user activity, and time-based trends. The interpolation method was then used in determining regions that have unusual patterns of networking based on the hashtag and determining the area of influence most actively engaged. Results and Conclusions The study showed that central and southeastern regions of Tehran exhibited highest levels of virtual activity concerning the Book Garden. Using a triangulation-based interpolation method, the study traced a specific zone of influence, acknowledging the spatial location of the Book Garden and neighboring culture districts as a “hidden layer” having a significant impact (Level 4) on the space’s popularness. The study showed that peak activity was at 4 PM, and access issues were correlated with lower popularness during evening hours. This work presents a novel and reliable methodology for determining the attractiveness of cityscapes through social media data, thus providing a reproducible template for later research in the context of urban geography.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-912/v1?src=rss">Modernizing Commercial Agency Regulations in Saudi Arabia: Legal Reforms and Comparative Insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background this study examines the modernization of Saudi’s Commercial Agency Law the 2022–2023 reforms, with a focus on legal, economic, and comparative dimensions. For decades, the previous framework faced criticism for its rigid nationality restrictions, procedural inefficiencies, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The reforms form part of the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy, aiming to diversify the economy, strengthen private sector competitiveness, and integrate more fully with global trade systems. This research also evaluates how the reforms align with Shariah principles, balancing commercial flexibility with religious compliance. Methods the study adopts a doctrinal legal methodology, systematically analyzing statutory amendments and implementing regulations considering Saudi case law and policy statements. A comparative approach is employed to benchmark the reforms against best practices in jurisdictions such as the UAE and the UK, with particular emphasis on contract termination rules, registration systems, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Sources include secondary data such as official gazettes, ministerial circulars, judicial precedents, and academic literature. Results key legislative changes include the relaxation of nationality requirements for commercial agents, enabling broader foreign participation; the digitalization of agency registration and renewal processes, reducing administrative burdens; clarified termination and compensation provisions, enhancing contractual certainty; and formal recognition of arbitration clauses, offering greater dispute resolution flexibility. These reforms have the potential to significantly improve market transparency, reduce litigation and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Conclusions although the reforms represent a significant advancement, challenges remain, including judicial consistency in interpreting the new provisions, resistance among entrenched market players, and the need for enhanced regulatory guidance. The paper recommends targeted judicial and practitioner training, proactive awareness campaigns, and GCC-wide legal harmonization to amplify reform benefits. Implemented effectively, these measures could solidify Saudi Arabia’s role as a regional leader in commercial agency regulation, strengthen investor confidence, and advance the Kingdom’s long-term economic diversification goals.

                <p>by Giacomo Severini, David Muñoz</p>

Predictive simulations based on explicit, physiologically inspired, control policies, can be used to test theories on motor control and to evaluate the effect of interventions on the different components of control. Several control architectures have been proposed for simulating locomotor tasks, based on fully feedback, reflex-based, controllers, or on feedforward architectures mimicking the Central Pattern Generators. Hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers. Here we propose a hybrid controller for predictive simulations of cycling where the feedforward component is based on a well-known theoretical model, the Unit Burst Generation model, and the feedback component includes a limited set of reflex pathways, expected to be active during steady cycling. We show that this controller can simulate physiological stationary cycling patterns at different desired speeds and seat heights. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs. The controller here proposed, although simple in design, represent an instance of physiologically inspired generalizable controller for cyclical lower limb tasks.

Despite the importance of memories in everyday life and the progress made in understanding how they are encoded and retrieved, the neural processes by which declarative memories are maintained or forgotten remain elusive. Part of the problem is that it is empirically difficult to measure the rate at which memories fade, even between repeated presentations of the source of the memory. Without such a ground-truth measure, it is hard to identify the corresponding neural correlates. This study addresses this problem by comparing individual patterns of functional connectivity against behavioral differences in forgetting speed derived from computational phenotyping. Specifically, the individual-specific values of the speed of forgetting in long-term memory (LTM) were estimated for 33 participants using a formal model fit to accuracy and response time data from an adaptive paired-associate learning task. Individual speeds of forgetting were then used to examine participant-specific patterns of resting-state fMRI connectivity, using machine learning techniques to identify the most predictive and generalizable features. Our results show that individual speeds of forgetting are associated with resting-state connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and cortical sensory areas. Cross-validation showed that individual speeds of forgetting were predicted with high accuracy (<i>r</i> = .78) from these connectivity patterns alone. These results support the view that DMN activity and the associated sensory regions are actively involved in maintaining memories and preventing their decline, a view that can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that forgetting is a result of storage degradation, rather than of retrieval failure.

During encoding, stimuli are embedded into memory traces that allow for their later retrieval. However, we cannot remember every aspect of our experiences. Here, we show that memory traces consist of multidimensional representational spaces whose formats are flexibly strengthened or weakened during encoding and consolidation. In a series of behavioral experiments, participants compared pairs of natural images on either two conceptual or two perceptual dimensions, leading them to incorporate the images into representational ‘spaces’. We found that representations from deep neural networks relate to both behavioral similarity and memory confidence judgements. Furthermore, we found that distances in task-relevant but not irrelevant spaces affected memory strengths. Interestingly, conceptual encoding did not impair subsequent rejection of similar lures, suggesting that task-irrelevant perceptual information remained in the memory trace. However, targeted memory reactivation following conceptual encoding deteriorated perceptual discrimination, indicating that it weakened the accessibility of perceptual formats. Our results demonstrate that representational formats are flexibly incorporated into memory, and more generally show how the organization of information in cognitive representational spaces shapes behavior.

Face-to-face communication relies on the seamless integration of multisensory signals, including voice, gaze, and head movements, to convey meaning effectively. This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g., looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g., looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Specifically, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that convey the same communicative intention, thus establishing a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. Additionally, we evaluated whether observers solve causal inference by adopting optimal Bayesian decision strategies or non-optimal approximate heuristics. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Combining psychophysics with computational modelling, we show that observers solved audiovisual causal inference using non-optimal heuristics that nevertheless approximate optimal Bayesian inference with high accuracy. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013454">Adaptive algorithms for shaping behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William L. Tong, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Gautam Reddy</p>

Dogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks (‘shaping’). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a teacher-student framework for shaping behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its student’s task based on the student’s transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using algorithms for Monte Carlo planning under uncertainty, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms achieve a careful balance between reinforcement and extinction. Near-optimal algorithms track learning rate to adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on a sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping behavior that applies to both animals and artificial agents.
