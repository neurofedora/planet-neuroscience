<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states—a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-omic rejuvenation of human cells by maturation phase transient reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Ageing is the gradual decline in organismal fitness that occurs over time leading to tissue dysfunction and disease. At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Somatic cell reprogramming, the process of converting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can reverse these age-associated changes. However, during iPSC reprogramming, somatic cell identity is lost, and can be difficult to reacquire as re-differentiated iPSCs often resemble foetal rather than mature adult cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of reprogramming, which suggests full iPSC reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first 'maturation phase transient reprogramming' (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are expressed until this rejuvenation point followed by withdrawal of their induction. Using dermal fibroblasts from middle age donors, we found that cells temporarily lose and then reacquire their fibroblast identity during MPTR, possibly as a result of epigenetic memory at enhancers and/or persistent expression of some fibroblast genes. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome, including H3K9me3 histone methylation levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock, was rejuvenated to a similar extent. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MTPR appears substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. In addition, MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, and showed partial functional rejuvenation of their migration speed. Finally, our work suggests that more extensive reprogramming does not necessarily result in greater rejuvenation but instead that optimal time windows exist for rejuvenating the transcriptome and the epigenome. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from complete pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulated actin reorganization mediated by motor proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria-Veronica Ciocanel, Aravind Chandrasekaran, Carli Mager, Qin Ni, Garegin A. Papoian, Adriana Dawes</p>

Cortical actin networks are highly dynamic and play critical roles in shaping the mechanical properties of cells. The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin <i>in vivo</i>, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic coupling of residues within proteins as a mechanistic foundation of many enigmatic pathogenic missense variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Ose, Brandon M. Butler, Avishek Kumar, I. Can Kazan, Maxwell Sanderford, Sudhir Kumar, S. Banu Ozkan</p>

Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor fall in any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for pathogenesis. In this study, we present an analysis of 591 pathogenic missense variants in 144 human enzymes that suggests that allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites is a plausible biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of <i>β-Glucocerebrosidase</i> (GCase) in which a vast majority of 94 sites harboring Gaucher disease-associated missense variants are located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling caused by missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive and optimized COVID-19 vaccination strategies across geographical regions and age groups</a></h4>

We evaluate the efficiency of various heuristic strategies for allocating vaccines against COVID-19 and compare them to strategies found using optimal control theory. Our approach is based on a mathematical model which tracks the spread of disease among different age groups and across different geographical regions, and we introduce a method to combine age-specific contact data to geographical movement data. As a case study, we model the epidemic in the population of mainland Finland utilizing mobility data from a major telecom operator. Our approach allows to determine which geographical regions and age groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the burden of disease. Instead, more lives could be saved by using strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The expression of virulence genes increases membrane permeability and sensitivity to envelope stress in Salmonella Typhimurium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Malgorzata Sobota, Pilar Natalia Rodilla Ramirez, Alexander Cambré, Andrea Rocker, Julien Mortier, Théo Gervais, Tiphaine Haas, Delphine Cornillet, Dany Chauvin, Isabelle Hug, Thomas Julou, Abram Aertsen, Médéric Diard</p>

Virulence gene expression can represent a substantial fitness cost to pathogenic bacteria. In the model entero-pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm), such cost favors emergence of attenuated variants during infections that harbor mutations in transcriptional activators of virulence genes (e.g., <i>hilD</i> and <i>hilC</i>). Therefore, understanding the cost of virulence and how it relates to virulence regulation could allow the identification and modulation of ecological factors to drive the evolution of <i>S</i>.Tm toward attenuation. In this study, investigations of membrane status and stress resistance demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) expression level of virulence factors embedded in the envelope increases membrane permeability and sensitizes <i>S</i>.Tm to membrane stress. This is independent from a previously described growth defect associated with virulence gene expression in <i>S</i>.Tm. Pretreating the bacteria with sublethal stress inhibited virulence expression and increased stress resistance. This trade-off between virulence and stress resistance could explain the repression of virulence expression in response to harsh environments in <i>S</i>.Tm. Moreover, we show that virulence-associated stress sensitivity is a burden during infection in mice, contributing to the inherent instability of <i>S</i>.Tm virulence. As most bacterial pathogens critically rely on deploying virulence factors in their membrane, our findings could have a broad impact toward the development of antivirulence strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RNA Pol IV induces antagonistic parent-of-origin effects on Arabidopsis endosperm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Prasad R. V. Satyaki, Mary Gehring</p>

Gene expression in endosperm—a seed tissue that mediates transfer of maternal resources to offspring—is under complex epigenetic control. We show here that plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) mediates parental control of endosperm gene expression. Pol IV is required for the production of small interfering RNAs that typically direct DNA methylation. We compared small RNAs (sRNAs), DNA methylation, and mRNAs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> endosperm from heterozygotes produced by reciprocally crossing wild-type (WT) plants to Pol IV mutants. We find that maternally and paternally acting Pol IV induce distinct effects on endosperm. Loss of maternal or paternal Pol IV impacts sRNAs and DNA methylation at different genomic sites. Strikingly, maternally and paternally acting Pol IV have antagonistic impacts on gene expression at some loci, divergently promoting or repressing endosperm gene expression. Antagonistic parent-of-origin effects have only rarely been described and are consistent with a gene regulatory system evolving under parental conflict.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hasty sensorimotor decisions rely on an overlap of broad and selective changes in motor activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gerard Derosiere, David Thura, Paul Cisek, Julie Duque</p>

Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. A total of 50 participants performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in 2 contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in 9 finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while participants were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, although this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.

                Kwak and Curtis demonstrate that the memory formats measured with fMRI for two different visual features, orientation and motion direction, are shared in an abstract line-like format. These results demonstrate that the goal-relevant details of past percepts are recoded into abstract working memory representations in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Task-related hemodynamic responses in human early visual cortex are modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance</a></h4>

              
                Early visual cortex exhibits widespread hemodynamic responses in the absence of visual stimulation, which are entrained to the timing of a task and not predicted by local spiking or local field potential (LFP). Such task-related responses ('TRRs') covary with reward magnitude and physiological signatures of arousal. It is unknown, however, if TRRs change on a trial-to-trial basis according to behavioral performance and task difficulty. If so, this would suggest that TRRs reflect arousal on a trial-to-trial timescale and covary with critical task and behavioral variables. We measured fMRI-BOLD responses in the early visual cortex of human observers performing an orientation discrimination task consisting of separate easy and hard runs of trials. Stimuli were presented in a small portion of one hemifield, but the fMRI response was measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere, far from the stimulus representation and focus of spatial attention. TRRs scaled in amplitude with task difficulty, behavioral accuracy, reaction time, and lapses across trials. These modulations were not explained by the influence of respiration, cardiac activity, or head movement on the fMRI signal. Similar modulations with task difficulty and behavior were observed in pupil size. These results suggest that TRRs reflect arousal and behavior on the timescale of individual trials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic loci and metabolic states associated with murine epigenetic aging</a></h4>

              
                Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) are linked to aging. Here, we profile highly conserved CpGs in 339 predominantly female mice belonging to the BXD family for which we have deep longevity and genomic data. We use a 'pan-mammalian' microarray that provides a common platform for assaying the methylome across mammalian clades. We computed epigenetic clocks and tested associations with DNAm entropy, diet, weight, metabolic traits, and genetic variation. We describe the multifactorial variance of methylation at these CpGs, and show that high fat diet augments the age-associated changes. Entropy increases with age. The progression to disorder, particularly at CpGs that gain methylation over time, was predictive of genotype-dependent life expectancy. The longer-lived BXD strains had comparatively lower entropy at a given age. We identified two genetic loci that modulate rates of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA): one on chromosome (Chr) 11 that encompasses the <i>Erbb2/Her2 </i>oncogenic region, and a second on Chr19 that contains a cytochrome P450 cluster. Both loci harbor genes associated with EAA in humans including <i>STXBP4</i>, <i>NKX2-</i>3, and <i>CUTC</i>. Transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed associations with oxidation-reduction, metabolic, and immune response pathways. Our results highlight concordant loci for EAA in humans and mice, and demonstrate a tight coupling between the metabolic state and epigenetic aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation of a CRF1-Cre transgenic rat and the role of central amygdala CRF1 cells in nociception and anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) receptors are critical to stress responses because they allow neurons to respond to CRF released in response to stress. Our understanding of the precise role of CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing neuronal populations in CRF-mediated behaviors has been largely limited to mouse experiments due to the lack of genetic tools available to selectively visualize and manipulate CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in rats. Here, we describe the generation and validation of a transgenic CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat, which expresses a bicistronic <i>iCre-2A-<sup>td</sup>Tomato </i>transgene directed by 200kb of promoter and enhancer sequence surrounding the<i> Crhr1</i> cDNA present within a BAC clone, that has been transgenically inserted into the rat genome. We report that <i>Crhr1 </i>and <i>Cre </i>mRNA expression are highly colocalized in CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats within both the central amygdala (CeA), composed of mostly GABAergic neurons, and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), composed of mostly glutamatergic neurons. In the CeA, membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and responses to CRF bath application in <sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons are similar to those previously reported in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in CRFR1-GFP mice. We show that stimulatory DREADD receptors can be selectively targeted to CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells via virally delivered Cre-dependent transgenes, that transfected Cre/<sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells are activated by clozapine-n-oxide <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and that activation of these cells <i>in vivo</i> increases anxiety-like behavior and nocifensive responses. Outside the amygdala, we show that Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato is expressed in several brain areas across the rostrocaudal axis of the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat brain, and that the expression pattern of Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells is similar to the known expression pattern of CRF<sub>1 </sub>cells. Given the accuracy of expression in the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre rat, modern genetic techniques used to investigate the anatomy, physiology, and behavioral function of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons and circuits can now be performed in assays that require the use of rats as the model organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unexpected inhibition of motor function by dopamine activation of D1/D2 co-expressing striatal neurons.</a></h4>

              
                The central function of the striatum and its dopaminergic (DA) afference in motor control and integration of cognitive and emotional processes is commonly explained by the two striatal efferent pathways characterized by striatal projection neurons (SPNs) expressing DA D1 receptor- and D2 receptor (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs), respectively, regardless of SPNs co-expressing these two receptors (D1/D2-SPNs). Here, after developing an approach that enables to target these hybrid SPNs, we demonstrated that, although these SPNs are rare, they play a major role in guiding the motor function of the other two main populations and convey a DA-mediated antagonistic motor brake. D1/D2-SPNs project exclusively to the external globus pallidus (GPe) and have specific electrophysiological features with distinctive integration of DA signals. Optogenetic stimulation and loss-of-function experiments indicated that D1/D2-SPNs potentiate the prokinetic and antikinetic functions of D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs, respectively, and restrain the integrated motor response to psychostimulants. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of this third unacknowledged population of D1/D2 co-expressing neurons, which orchestrates the fine-tuning of DA regulation in the thalamo-cortico-striatal loops.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Language Comprehension During Saccadic Eye Movements: An Investigation Using the N400 Event-Related Brain Potential</a></h4>

              
                In many situations of everyday life, it is important to quickly understand a spoken message despite distraction by an already ongoing activity. Previous dual-task studies recording the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) have shown that auditory language comprehension can be strongly delayed by temporally overlapping additional tasks. In the current study, we investigated whether this interference is aggravated by the need for saccadic eye movements and visuospatial attention shifts in the overlapping task. In two dual-task experiments, a synonymy judgment task for spoken words was combined with a visual discrimination task at different stimulus onset asynchronies. In half of the trials, the primary visual task required a 10 degree exogenous saccade towards a peripheral stimulus. The timing of semantic processing in the secondary task was assessed by recording the N400. We replicated that with increasing temporal overlap between the tasks, the N400 component was strongly delayed. However, additional saccade-related processes in the primary task had no detrimental effects on concurrent spoken language processing on their own. Unexpectedly, we also observed that a preceding saccade consistently facilitated subsequent motoric processing in the visual task (as indexed by manual reaction times and the lateralized readiness potential), suggesting that saccade execution as such can significantly enhance subsequent processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A visual representation of the hand in the resting somatomotor regions of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Hands are regularly in sight in everyday life. This visibility affects motor control, perception, and attention, as visual information is integrated into an internal model of sensorimotor control. Spontaneous brain activity, i.e., ongoing activity in the absence of an active task (rest), is correlated among somatomotor regions that are jointly activated during motor tasks1. Moreover, recent studies suggest that spontaneous activity patterns do not only replay at rest task activation patterns, but also maintain a model of the statistical regularities (priors) of the body and environment, which may be used to predict upcoming behavior (Raichle et al,2011; Betti et al, 2021; Pezzulo, 2021). Here we test whether spontaneous activity in the human somatomotor cortex is modulated by visual stimuli that display hands vs. non-hand stimuli, and by the use/action they represent. We analyzed activity with fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to examine the similarity between spontaneous (rest) activity patterns and task-evoked patterns to the presentation of natural hands, robot hands, gloves, or control stimuli (food). In the left somatomotor cortex we observed a stronger (multi-voxel) spatial correlation between resting-state activity and natural hand picture patterns, as compared to other stimuli. A trend analysis showed that task-rest pattern similarity was influenced by inferred visual and motor attributes (i.e., correlation for hand>robot>glove>food). We did not observe any task-rest similarity in the visual cortex. We conclude that somatomotor brain regions code at rest for visual representations of hand stimuli and their inferred use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signalling speed along a key white matter tract influences memory recall ability in humans</a></h4>

              
                Conduction velocity is the speed at which electrical signals travel along axons and is a crucial determinant of neural communication. Inferences about conduction velocity can now be made in vivo in humans using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and a measure called the MR g-ratio. Here, in the first application to cognition, we found that increased MR g-ratio, and by inference faster conduction velocity, specifically in the parahippocampal cingulum bundle, which connects the hippocampus with a range of other brain areas, was associated with better memory recall ability in 217 healthy adults. Moreover, two tract features seemed to favour better memory retrieval - large inner axon diameters and coherently organised neurites, both of which facilitate speedy signalling. These results offer a new perspective on drivers of individual differences in memory recall ability. More broadly, they show that MR g-ratio can provide novel insights into how the human brain processes and integrates information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extended functional connectivity of convergent structural alterations among individuals with PTSD: A neuroimaging meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder defined by the onset of intrusive, avoidant, negative cognitive or affective, and/or hyperarousal symptoms after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Previous voxel-based morphometry studies have provided insight into structural brain alterations associated with PTSD with notable heterogeneity across these studies. Furthermore, how structural alterations may be associated with brain function, as measured by task-free and task-based functional connectivity, remains to be elucidated. Methods: Using emergent meta-analytic techniques, we sought to first identify a consensus of structural alterations in PTSD using the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Next, we generated functional profiles of identified convergent structural regions utilizing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) methods. Finally, we performed functional decoding to examine mental functions associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM brain characterizations. Results: We observed convergent structural alterations in a single region located in the medial prefrontal cortex. The resultant rsFC and MACM maps identified functional connectivity across a widespread, whole-brain network that included frontoparietal and limbic regions. Conclusions: Consensus-based functional connectivity was observed in regions of the default mode, salience, and central executive networks, which play a role in the tripartite model of psychopathology. Functional decoding revealed overlapping associations with attention, memory, and emotion processes. Taken together, these findings have important implications in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative study between radiofrequency- and muscimol-induced inhibition of cultured networks of cortical neuron</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that spontaneously active cultured networks of cortical neuron grown planar microelectrode array are sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) fields and exhibit an inhibitory response more pronounced as the exposure time and power increase. To better understand the mechanism behind the observed effects, we aimed at identifying similarities and dissimilarities between the inhibitory effect of RF fields (continuous wave, 1800 MHz) to the {gamma}-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor agonist muscimol (MU). Inhibition of network bursting activity in response to RF exposure became apparent at an SAR level of 28.6 W/kg and co occurred with an elevation of the culture medium temperature of ~1 degree Celsius. Differently to a pharmacological inhibition with MU, exposure to RF fields preferentially inhibits bursting over spiking activity and exerts less constrains on neural network bursting synchrony. Network rebound excitation, a phenomenon relying on intrinsic properties of cortical neurons, was observed consecutively to the removal of tonic hyperpolarization after washout of MU but not in response to cessation of RF exposure which implies that hyperpolarization is not the main driving force mediating the inhibitory effects of RF fields. At the level of single neurons, network inhibition induced by MU and RF fields occurred with reduced action potential (AP) half-width. As change in AP waveform tightly influence efficiency of synaptic transmission, the narrowing effect on AP seen under RF exposure might contribute to reduce network bursting activity. By pointing only to a partial overlap between the inhibitory hallmarks of these two forms of inhibition, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of action of RF fields differ from the ones mediated by the activation of GABA A receptor. The rapid onset of the inhibitory effect of RF fields and its reversibility strikingly similar to MU are in favour of a mechanism interacting with fast operating targets at the membrane such as ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental switch in prediction and adaptation to pain in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Habituation to recurrent non-threatening or unavoidable noxious stimuli is an important aspect of adaptation to pain and indicates the ability of the brain to encode expectation of imminent nociception. However, it is not known whether the newborn brain can predict and habituate to recurrent noxious inputs. We used electroencephalography to investigate changes in cortical microstates, which represent the complex sequential processing of noxious inputs, following repeated clinically-required heel lances in term and preterm infants. Noxious stimulus repetition decreased the engagement of early sensory-related microstates and associated behavioural and physiological responses in term infants, while preterm infants did not show signs of adaptation. Nevertheless, both groups displayed a switch between different microstates at longer latencies. These data suggests that the preterm brain is capable of encoding high-level contextual differences in pain, but cannot update its prediction, which allows for adaptation, emphasising the vulnerability of this population to recurrent pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional rhythms are generated in binocular cells</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is intrinsically rhythmic and oscillates based on the discrete sampling of either single or multiple objects. Recently, studies employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-temporal behavioral approaches have found that the early visual cortex (V1/V2) modulates attentional rhythms. However, both monocular cells and binocular cells are in the early visual cortex, and whether the neural site of attentional rhythms is monocular cells or binocular cells remains poorly understood. In Experiment 1, we reset the phase of attentional rhythms in one monocular channel (left eye or right eye) by the dichoptic cue and tracked the temporal response function (TRF) of the monocular channel in the left and right eyes separately using time response tracking technology. We found no significant differences in the two TRFs of each monocular eye, suggesting that attention rarely switched between the two eyes, indicating that binocular cells, not monocular cells, are the neural site of attentional rhythms. These results were verified even when resetting the phases of attentional rhythms by a binocular cue in Experiment 2. These results constitute direct neural evidence supporting rhythmic attention theory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-neuron bursts encode pathological oscillations in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation procedures offer an invaluable opportunity to study disease through intracranial recordings from awake patients. Herein, we address the relationship between single-neuron and aggregate-level (local field potential; LFP) activities in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of patients with Parkinson's disease (n=19) and essential tremor (n=16), respectively. Both disorders have been characterized by pathologically elevated LFP oscillations, as well as an increased tendency for neuronal bursting. Our findings suggest that periodic single-neuron bursts encode both pathophysiological beta (13-33Hz; STN) and tremor (4-10Hz; Vim) LFP oscillations, evidenced by strong time-frequency and phase-coupling relationships between the bursting and LFP signals. Spiking activity occurring outside of bursts had no relationship to the LFP. In STN, bursting activity most commonly preceded the LFP oscillation, suggesting that neuronal bursting generated within STN may give rise to an aggregate-level LFP oscillation. In Vim, LFP oscillations most commonly preceded bursting activity, suggesting that neuronal firing may be entrained by periodic afferent inputs. In both STN and Vim, the phase-coupling relationship between LFP and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) signals closely resembled the relationships between the LFP and single-neuron bursting. This suggests that periodic single-neuron bursting is likely representative of a higher spatial and temporal resolution readout of periodic increases in the amplitude of HFOs, which themselves may be a higher resolution readout of aggregate-level LFP oscillations. Overall, our results may reconcile 'rate' and 'oscillation' models of Parkinson's disease and shed light onto the single-neuron basis and origin of pathophysiological oscillations in movement disorders.

                Purpose Cell-free hemoglobin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Hb) may be one of the main drivers of secondary brain injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Haptoglobin scavenging of CSF-Hb has been shown to mitigate cerebrovascular disruption. Using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and blood oxygenation-level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity imaging (BOLD-CVR) the aim was to assess the acute toxic effect of CSF-Hb on cerebral blood flow and autoregulation, as well as to test the protective effects of haptoglobin. Methods DSA imaging was performed in eight anesthetized and ventilated sheep (mean weight: 80.4 kg) at baseline, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after infusion of hemoglobin (Hb) or co-infusion with haptoglobin (Hb:Haptoglobin) into the left lateral ventricle. Additionally, 10 ventilated sheep (mean weight: 79.8 kg) underwent BOLD-CVR imaging to assess the cerebrovascular reserve capacity. Results DSA imaging did not show a difference in mean transit time or cerebral blood flow. Whole-brain BOLD-CVR compared to baseline decreased more in the Hb group after 15 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 +/- 0.01 vs -0.01 +/- 0.02) and remained diminished compared to Hb:Haptoglobin group after 30 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 +/- 0.01 vs 0.0 +/- 0.01), 45 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 +/- 0.01 vs 0.01 +/- 0.02) and 60 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 +/- 0.02 vs 0.01 +/- 0.01). Conclusion It is demonstrated that CSF-Hb toxicity leads to rapid cerebrovascular reactivity impairment, which is blunted by haptoglobin co-infusion. BOLD-CVR may therefore be further evaluated as a monitoring strategy for CSF-Hb toxicity after aSAH.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concentration dependent dual effect of the endozepine ODN on neuronal spiking activity</a></h4>

              
                Endozepines, known as the endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine-binding sites, include the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing products, the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). Despite indisputable evidences of the binding of ODN on GABAAR-BZ-binding sites, their action on this receptor lacks compelling electrophysiological observations, some studies reporting that ODN acts as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of GABAAR while others suggest the opposite (positive allosteric modulation, PAM effect). All these studies were carried out in vitro with various neuronal cell types. To further elucidate the role of ODN on neuronal excitability, we tested its effect in vivo in the cortex of the anesthetized mouse. Spontaneous neuronal spikes were recorded by the mean of an extracellular pipette in the vicinity of which ODN was micro-infused, either at high dose (10-5M) or low dose (10-11M). ODN at high dose induced a significant increase of neuronal spiking. This effect could be antagonized by the GABAAR-BZ-binding sites blocker flumazenil. In sharp contrast, at low concentration, ODN reduced neuronal spiking in a magnitude similar to GABA itself. Interestingly, this decrease of neuronal activity by low dose of ODN was not flumazenil dependent suggesting that this effect is mediated by another receptor. Finally, we show that astrocytes in culture, known to be stimulated by picomolar dose of ODN via a GPCR, increased their export of GABA when stimulated by low dose of ODN. Our results confirm the versatility of ODN in the control of GABA transmission, but suggest that its PAM-like effect is, at least in part, mediated via an astrocytic non-GABAAR ODN receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of experiencing CS-US pairings on instructed fear reversal</a></h4>

              
                Fear learning allows us to identify and anticipate aversive events, and adapt our behavior accordingly. This is often thought to rely on associative learning mechanisms where an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), eventually leading to the CS also being perceived as aversive and threatening. Importantly, however, humans also show verbal fear learning. Namely, they have the ability to change their responses to stimuli rapidly through verbal instructions about CS-US pairings. Past research on the link between experience-based and verbal fear learning indicated that verbal instructions about a reversal of CS-US pairings can fully override the effects of previously experienced CS-US pairings, as measured through fear ratings, skin conductance, and fear- potentiated startle. However, it remains an open question whether such instructions can also annul memory traces in the brain. Here, we used a fear reversal paradigm in conjunction with representational similarity analysis of fMRI data to test whether verbal instructions fully override the effects of experienced CS-US pairings in fear-related brain regions or not. Previous research suggests that only the right amygdala should show lingering representations of previously experienced threat (a so-called 'Pavlovian trace'). Unexpectedly, we found evidence for the residual effect of prior CS-US experience to be much more widespread than anticipated, in the amygdala but also cortical regions like the dorsal anterior cingulate or dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. This finding shines a new light on the interaction of different fear learning mechanisms, at times with unexpected consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroRNA inhibition using antimiRs in acute human brain tissue sections</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: An emerging pre-clinical approach for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is targeting the microRNA (miRNA) system. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Targeting miRNAs, which is possible using antisense oligonucleotide antimiRs can produce broad effects on gene expression suited to the complex pathophysiology in temporal lobe epilepsy. Potent anti-seizure and disease-modifying effects have been reported for antimiRs targeting microRNA-134 (antimiR-134). To date, however, pre-clinical testing has been performed using in vitro cell cultures and rodent models. It is uncertain how well this approach will translate to the clinic. Here, we develop an antimiR testing platform in human brain tissue sections. Methodology: Human brain specimens were obtained with consent from patients undergoing resective surgery to treat focal drug-resistant epilepsy. Neocortical specimens were submerged in modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), dissected for clinical neuropathological examination, and unused material transferred for sectioning. Individual tissue sections were incubated in oxygenated ACSF, containing either antimiR-134 or a non-targeting control antimiR, for 24 hours at room temperature. RNA integrity was assessed using BioAnalyzer processing, and individual miRNA levels measured using RT-qPCR. Results: ACSF transport had no obvious impact on any clinical neurosurgical or neuropathological procedure and specimens were confirmed to be viable following this process. RNA was well-preserved by transportation of specimens in ACSF, with RNA integrity scores significantly higher than tissue transported without ACSF. AntimiR-134 mediated a specific and dose-dependent knockdown of miR-134 in human neocortical sections, with approximately 75% reduction of miR-134 at 1 M and 90% reduction at 3 M. These doses did not have off-target effects on expression of a selection of three other miRNAs (miR-10, miR-129 or miR-132). Significance: This is the first demonstration of antimiR-134 effects in live human brain tissues. The findings lend further support to the preclinical development of miR-134 and offer a flexible platform for the pre-clinical testing of antimiRs, and other antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, in human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The pitfalls of measuring representational similarityusing representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                A core challenge in neuroscience is to assess whether diverse systems represent the world similarly. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is an innovative approach to address this problem and has become increasingly popular across disciplines from machine learning to computational neuroscience. Despite these successes, RSA regularly uncovers difficult-to-reconcile and contradictory findings. Here we demonstrate the pitfalls of using RSA to infer representational similarity and explain how contradictory findings arise and support false inferences when left unchecked. By comparing neural representations in primate, human and computational models, we reveal two problematic phenomena that are ubiquitous in current research: a 'mimic' effect, where confounds in stimuli can lead to high RSA scores between provably dissimilar systems, and a 'modulation effect', where RSA-scores become dependent on stimuli used for testing. Since our results bear on existing findings and inferences, we provide recommendations to avoid these pitfalls and sketch a way forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis of non-human primate models for evaluating prion disease therapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by the conformational corruption of the prion protein (PrP), encoded by the prion protein gene (PRNP). While no disease-modifying therapy is currently available, genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept support development of therapies that lower PrP levels in the brain. In light of proposals for clinical testing of such drugs in presymptomatic individuals at risk for genetic prion disease, extensive nonclinical data are likely to be required, with extra attention paid to choice of animal models. Uniquely, the entire prion disease process can be faithfully modeled through transmission of human prions to non-human primates (NHPs), raising the question of whether NHP models should be used to assess therapeutic efficacy. Here we systematically aggregate data from N=527 prion-inoculated animals spanning six decades of research studies. Using this dataset, we assess prion strain, route of administration, endpoint, and passage number to characterize the relationship of tested models to currently prevalent human subtypes of prion disease. We analyze the incubation times observed across diverse models and perform power calculations to assess the practicability of testing prion disease therapeutic efficacy in NHPs. We find that while some models may theoretically be able to support therapeutic efficacy studies, pilot studies would be required to confirm incubation time and attack rate before pivotal studies could be designed, cumulatively requiring several years. The models with the shortest and most tightly distributed incubation times are those with smaller brains and weaker homology to humans. Our findings indicate that it would be challenging to conduct efficacy studies in NHPs in a paradigm that honors the potential advantages of NHPs over other available models, on a timeframe that would not risk unduly delaying patient access to promising drug candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The strength of feedback processing is associated with resistance to visual backward masking during illusory contour processing in adult humans.</a></h4>

              
                Re-entrant feedback processing is a key mechanism of visual object-recognition, especially under compromised viewing conditions where only sparse information is available and object features must be interpolated. Illusory contour stimuli are commonly used in conjunction with visual evoked potentials (VEP) to study these filling-in processes, with characteristic modulation of the VEP in the ~100-150ms timeframe associated with this re-entrant processing. Substantial inter-individual variability in timing and amplitude of feedback-related VEP modulation is observed, raising the question whether this variability might underlie inter-individual differences in the ability to form strong perceptual gestalts. Backward masking paradigms have been used to study inter-individual variance in the ability to form robust object perceptions before processing of the mask interferes with object-recognition. Some individuals recognize objects when the time between target object and mask is extremely short, whereas others struggle to do so even at longer target-to-mask intervals. We asked whether timing and amplitude of feedback-related VEP modulations were associated with individual differences in resistance to backward masking. Participants (N=40) showed substantial performance variability in detecting illusory contours at intermediate target-to-mask intervals (67ms and 117ms), allowing us to use kmeans clustering to divide the population into four performance groups (poor, low-average, high-average, superior). There was a clear relationship between the amplitude (but not the timing) of feedback-related VEP modulation and illusory contour detection during backward masking. We conclude that individual differences in the strength of feedback processing in neurotypical humans lead to differences in the ability to quickly establish perceptual awareness of incomplete visual objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The theta paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations reflect both local sleep and cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Human brain activity generates electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations that characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state, however theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as "frontal midline theta", the former has been investigated far less but is considered to be a marker for local sleep during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults performing 6 tasks under 3 levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas, however sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta were task-dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex during a spatial game. This suggests that theta caused by sleep deprivation may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior. While our results find differences in topography from frontal midline theta, they raise the possibility that a common mechanism may underly both theta oscillations during cognition and during sleep deprivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating ordinal position information from auditory sequence memory in human brains</a></h4>

              
                Retaining a sequence of events in their order is a core ability of many cognitive functions, such as speech recognition, movement control, and episodic memory. Although content representations have been widely studied in working memory (WM), little is known about how ordinal position information of an auditory sequence is retained in the human brain as well as its coding characteristics. In fact, there is still a lack of an efficient approach to directly access the stored ordinal position code, since the neural activities enter a relatively 'activity-silent' WM state during WM retention. Here participants performed an auditory sequence WM task with their brain activities recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We developed new triggering events that could successfully reactivate neural representations of ordinal position from the 'activity-silent' retention stage. Importantly, the rank reactivation is further related to recognition behavior, confirming its indexing of WM storage. Furthermore, the ordinal position code displays an intriguing 'stable-dynamic' format, i.e., undergoing the same dynamic neutral trajectory during both encoding and retention (whenever reactivated). Overall, our results provide an effective approach to accessing the behaviorally-relevant ordinal position information in auditory sequence WM and reveal its new temporal characteristics.

                Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et a (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work.

                Prospective outcomes bias behavior in a "Pavlovian" manner: Reward prospect invigorates action, while punishment prospect suppresses it. Theories have posited Pavlovian biases as global action "priors" in unfamiliar or uncontrollable environments. However, this account fails to explain the strength of these biases---causing frequent action slips---even in well-known environments. We propose that Pavlovian control is additionally useful if flexibly recruited by instrumental control. Specifically, instrumental action plans might shape selective attention to reward/ punishment information and thus the input to Pavlovian control. In two eye-tracking samples (N = 35/ 64), we observed that Go/ NoGo action plans influenced when and for how long participants attended to reward/ punishment information, which in turn biased their responses in a Pavlovian manner. Participants with stronger attentional effects showed higher performance. Thus, humans appear to align Pavlovian control with their instrumental action plans, extending its role beyond action defaults to a powerful tool ensuring robust action execution.

                Differential expression of myelin-related genes and changes in myelin thickness have been demonstrated in mice after chronic psychosocial stress, a risk factor for anxiety disorders. To determine whether and how stress affects structural remodeling of nodes of Ranvier, another form of myelin plasticity, we developed a 3D reconstruction analysis of node morphology in C57BL/6NCrl and DBA/2NCrl mice. We identified strain-dependent effects of chronic stress on node morphology, including elongation of paranodes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in DBA/2NCrl mice. Furthermore, chronic chemogenetic activation of the ventral hippocampus-to-mPFC pathway resulted in increased risk assessment behavior and shortened paranodes specifically in stimulated axons, providing a direct link between anxiety-like behavior and remodeling of the nodes. Altogether, our data demonstrate genetic regulation of nodal remodeling in stress and suggest an activity-dependent regulation of paranodes in anxiety-related circuits. Nodal remodeling may thus contribute to the aberrant circuit function associated with anxiety disorders.

                Currently, calcium imaging allows for the long-term recording of large-scale neuronal activity in diverse states. However, it remains difficult to extract neuronal dynamics from recorded imaging data. In this study, we propose an improved CNMF-based algorithm and an effective method for extracting cell shapes with fewer false positives and false negatives caused by image processing. We also showed that the values obtained during image processing can be combined and used for false positive determination of cells. For the CNMF algorithm, we combined cell-by-cell regularization and baseline shrinkage estimation, which greatly improved its stability and robustness. We applied these methods to artificial and real data and confirmed their effectiveness. Our method is simpler and faster, detects more cells with lower firing rates and signal-to-noise ratios, and enhance the quality of the extracted cell signals. These advances can improve the standard of downstream analysis and contribute to progress in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing different paradigms of morphine withdrawal on sleep behavior in male and female C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                The opioid epidemic has increased dramatically over the last few decades resulting in many suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD). The prevalence of opioids and opioid overdose has been driven by the development of new synthetic opioids, increased availability of prescription opioids, and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. As we see increased in exposure to opioids, the United States has also seen increases in the frequency of instances of Narcan (naloxone) administration as a life saving measure for respiratory depression, and, thus, consequently, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Sleep dysregulation is one of the main symptoms of OUD and opioid withdrawal syndrome, and therefore should be a key facet of animal models of OUD. Here we examine the effect of precipitated and spontaneous morphine withdrawal on sleep behaviors in C57BL/6J. We find that morphine administration and withdrawal dysregulates sleep, however not equally across morphine exposure paradigms and not qualitatively the same across sexes. Furthermore, many environmental triggers promote relapse to drug seeking/taking behavior, and the stress of disrupted sleep may fall into that category. We find that sleep deprivation dysregulates sleep in mice that had previous opioid withdrawal experience. These data suggest that the 3-day precipitated withdrawal paradigm has the most profound effects on opioid induced sleep dysregulation, and that further validate the construct of the 3-day precipitated withdrawal model as a model for opioid dependence and OUD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mouse mutants in schizophrenia risk genes GRIN2A and AKAP11 show EEG abnormalities in common with schizophrenia patients</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, whose etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Exome sequencing studies have uncovered rare, loss-of-function variants that greatly increase risk of schizophrenia, including loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A (aka GluN2A or NR2A, encoding the NMDA receptor subunit 2A) and AKAP11 (A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 11). AKAP11 and GRIN2A mutations are also associated with bipolar disorder, and epilepsy and developmental delay/intellectual disorder, respectively. Accessible in both humans and rodents, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings offer a window into brain activity and display abnormal features in schizophrenia patients. Does loss of Grin2a or Akap11 in mice also result in EEG abnormalities? METHODS: We monitored EEG in heterozygous and homozygous knockout Grin2a and Akap11 mutant mice compared with their wild-type littermates, at 3- and 6-months of age, across the sleep/wake cycle and during auditory stimulation protocols. RESULTS: Grin2a and Akap11 mutants exhibited increased resting gamma power, attenuated 40-50 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR), and reduced responses to unexpected auditory stimuli during mismatch negativity (MMN) tests. Sleep spindle density was reduced in a gene dose-dependent manner in Akap11 mutants, whereas Grin2a mutants showed increased sleep spindle density. CONCLUSIONS: The EEG phenotypes of Grin2a and Akap11 mutant mice show a variety of abnormal features that overlap considerably with human schizophrenia patients, reflecting systems-level changes caused by Grin2a and Akap11 deficiency. These neurophysiologic findings further substantiate Grin2a and Akap11 mutants as genetic models of schizophrenia and identify potential biomarkers for stratification of schizophrenia patients.

	<p>This study investigated the characteristics of cognitive impairment in patients with white matter lesions (WMLs) caused by cerebral small vessel disease and the corresponding changes in WM microstructures. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 50 patients with WMLs and 37 healthy controls were collected. Patients were divided into vascular cognitive impairment non-dementia and vascular dementia groups. Tract-based spatial statistics showed that patients with WMLs had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values throughout the WM areas but predominately in the forceps minor, forceps major (FMA), bilateral corticospinal tract, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and anterior thalamic radiation, compared to the control group. These fiber bundles were selected as regions of interest. There were significant differences in the FA, MD, AD, and RD values (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between groups. The DTI metrics of all fiber bundles significantly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), with the exception of the AD values of the FMA and ILF. Patients with WMLs showed changes in diffusion parameters in the main WM fiber bundles. Quantifiable changes in WM microstructure are the main pathological basis of cognitive impairment, and may serve as a biomarker of WMLs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Lasting Effects of Activating BDNF-Expressing PVH Neurons on Energy Balance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are implicit in causing obesity. Mutations that reduce BDNF and TrkB expression are associated with obesity in humans and mice. Recently, it was reported that <I>Bdnf</I> gene deletion in the neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) caused positive energy balance and severe obesity in the form of hyperphagia, impaired adaptive thermogenesis, and decreased energy expenditure. Thus, we hypothesize that activation of these neurons will have the opposite effect and provide an opportunity for long-lasting obesity treatment. To specifically activate BDNF-expressing PVH (PVH<sup>BDNF</sup>) neurons, we injected Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq bilaterally into the PVH of <I>Bdnf<sup>2A-Cre/+</sup></I> knock-in mice and then administered clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Using this technique, we demonstrated that acute activation of these neurons rapidly decreased normal nocturnal feeding and fasting-induced feeding in male and female mice. At thermoneutral temperatures, acute activation also rapidly increased adaptive thermogenesis, increased core body temperature, increased locomotion, increased energy expenditure, and decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in male and female mice. These observations indicate that acute stimulation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance and weight loss. However, the rapid decrease in RER after activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons was followed by a delayed and prolonged increase in RER that remained elevated for 3 d in female mice. Thus, although acute activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance in the short term, long-term effects of activation include sexually dimorphic overcompensatory mechanisms that may promote positive energy balance in female mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Egr1 Is Necessary for Forebrain Dopaminergic Signaling during Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Finding the link between behaviors and their regulatory molecular pathways is a major obstacle in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. The immediate early gene (IEG) <I>EGR1</I> is implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and is linked to gene pathways associated with social behavior. Despite extensive knowledge of <I>EGR1</I> gene regulation at the molecular level, it remains unclear how EGR1 deficits might affect the social component of these disorders. Here, we examined the social behavior of zebrafish with a mutation in the homologous gene <I>egr1</I>. Mutant fish exhibited reduced social approach and orienting, whereas other sensorimotor behaviors were unaffected. On a molecular level, expression of the dopaminergic biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), was strongly decreased in TH-positive neurons of the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus. These neurons are connected with basal forebrain (BF) neurons associated with social behavior. Chemogenetic ablation of around 30% of TH-positive neurons in this preoptic region reduced social attraction to a similar extent as the <I>egr1</I> mutation. These results demonstrate the requirement of Egr1 and dopamine signaling during social interactions, and identify novel circuitry underlying this behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">P3b Does Not Reflect Perceived Contrasts</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It has been shown that P3b is not a signature of perceptual awareness per se but is instead more closely associated with postperceptual processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Cohen et al., 2020</cross-ref>). Here, we seek to investigate whether human participants&rsquo; attentional states are different in the report and the no-report conditions. This difference in attentional states, if exists, may lead to degraded consciousness of the stimuli in the no-report condition, and it therefore remains unknown whether the disappearance of P3b is because of a lack of reportability or degraded consciousness. Results of our experiment 1 showed that participants did experience degraded contents of consciousness in the no-report condition. However, results of experiment 2 showed that the degraded contents of consciousness did <I>not</I> influence the amplitude of P3b. These findings strengthen the claim that P3b is <I>not</I> a signature of perceptual awareness but is associated with postperceptual processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deconstructing Synaptotagmin-1's Distinct Roles in Synaptic Vesicle Priming and Neurotransmitter Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) is a synaptic vesicle resident protein that interacts via its C2 domain with anionic lipids from the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner to efficiently trigger rapid neurotransmitter (NT) release. In addition, SYT1 acts as a negative regulator of spontaneous NT release and regulates synaptic vesicle (SV) priming. How these functions relate to each other mechanistically and what role other synaptotagmin (SYT) isoforms play in supporting and complementing the role of SYT1 is still under intensive investigation. In this work, we analyzed three putative functions of SYT1 in exocytosis by systematically varying its expression in autaptic hippocampal glutamatergic neurons from mice of either sex. We find that regulation of release probability is most sensitive to variation of expression levels, whereas its impact on vesicle priming is least sensitive. Also, loss of SYT1 phenotypes on spontaneous release and vesicle priming is compensated in less mature synaptic cultures by redundant support from SYT7. Overall, our data help in resolving some controversies in SYT1 functions in exocytosis and in our understanding of how SYT1 contributes to the pathophysiology underlying SYT1-related human neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work clarifies the functions of SYT1 protein in synaptic vesicle priming and spontaneous and calcium-evoked neurotransmitter release and analyzes whether these occur at different stages of synaptic responses by examining their relative sensitivity to protein concentration at the synaptic terminal. We demonstrate that these synaptic functions are unequally sensitive to both protein levels and neuronal stage, indicating that they operate under distinct molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze how these functions are modulated by another synaptotagmin isoform expression. We show that to understand the phenotype displayed by SYT1 knock-out neurons (<I>Syt1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) is necessary to consider the interplay between SYT1 and SYT7 molecules at the presynaptic terminal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activation of Extrasynaptic Kainate Receptors Drives Hilar Mossy Cell Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mossy cells (MCs) of the dentate gyrus are key components of an excitatory associative circuit established by reciprocal connections with dentate granule cells (GCs). MCs are implicated in place field encoding, pattern separation, and novelty detection, as well as in brain disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy and depression. Despite their functional relevance, little is known about the determinants that control MC activity. Here, we examined whether MCs express functional kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors involved in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and epilepsy. Using mouse hippocampal slices, we found that bath application of submicromolar and micromolar concentrations of the KAR agonist kainic acid induced inward currents and robust MC firing. These effects were abolished in GluK2 KO mice, indicating the presence of functional GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. In contrast to CA3 pyramidal cells, which are structurally and functionally similar to MCs and express synaptic KARs at mossy fiber (MF) inputs (i.e., GC axons), we found no evidence for KAR-mediated transmission at MF&ndash;MC synapses, indicating that most KARs at MCs are extrasynaptic. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analyses confirmed the extrasynaptic localization of GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. Finally, blocking glutamate transporters, a manipulation that increases extracellular levels of endogenous glutamate, was sufficient to induce KAR-mediated inward currents in MCs, suggesting that MC-KARs can be activated by increases in ambient glutamate. Our findings provide the first direct evidence of functional extrasynaptic KARs at a critical excitatory neuron of the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hilar mossy cells (MCs) are an understudied population of hippocampal neurons that form an excitatory loop with dentate granule cells. MCs have been implicated in pattern separation, spatial navigation, and epilepsy. Despite their importance in hippocampal function and disease, little is known about how MC activity is recruited. Here, we show for the first time that MCs express extrasynaptic kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors critically involved in neuronal function and epilepsy. While we found no evidence for synaptic KARs in MCs, KAR activation induced strong action potential firing of MCs, raising the possibility that extracellular KARs regulate MC excitability <I>in vivo</I> and may also promote dentate gyrus hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morpho-Electric Properties and Diversity of Oxytocin Neurons in Paraventricular Nucleus of Hypothalamus in Female and Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) are involved in modulating multiple functions, including social, maternal, feeding, and emotional related behaviors. PVN OXT neurons are canonically classified into magnocellular (Magno) and parvocellular (Parvo) subtypes. However, morpho-electric properties and the diversity of PVN OXT neurons are not well investigated. In this study, we profiled the morpho-electric properties of PVN OXT neurons by combining transgenic mice, electrophysiological recording, morphologic reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analyses. Total 224 PVN OXT neurons from 23 mice were recorded and used for analyses in this study, and 29 morpho-electric parameters were measured. Magno and Parvo OXT neurons have prominent differences in their morpho-electric features, and PVN OXT neurons in male and female mice share similar neuronal properties. Some morpho-electric features of PVN OXT neurons, especially Magno neurons, exhibit significant diverse changes along the rostral&ndash;caudal axis. Furthermore, we find that PVN OXT neurons are classified into at least six subtypes based on their morpho-electric properties via unsupervised clustering. Only one Magno-Parvo mixed subtype in posterior PVN subregion, but not the other five subtypes, showed significant neuronal activity change in different feeding conditions. Our study supports the diversity of PVN OXT neurons and subtle neuron classification will promote excavating the functions of oxytocinergic system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (OXT) is well known for its function in labor induction, but it also plays multiple roles in social, feeding, and emotional behaviors via modulating different brain regions. Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) OXT neurons are traditionally classified into magnocellular and parvocellular. However, functional and single-cell transcriptomic studies indicate that OXT neurons should be further classified. Here, we thoroughly investigated the morpho-electric properties and spatial distribution of PVN OXT neurons, and find that OXT neurons have at least six subtypes based on their morpho-electric features. Among these six subtypes, only one magnocellular-parvocellular mixed subtype, which are distributed in the posterior PVN subregion, change their activities with different feeding states. Our study uncovers the diversity of PVN OXT neurons and suggests the necessary of subtle neuronal classification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cocaine-Induced Changes in Sperm Cdkn1a Methylation Are Associated with Cocaine Resistance in Male Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paternal environmental perturbations can influence the physiology and behavior of offspring. For example, our previous work showed reduced cocaine reinforcement in male, but not female, progeny of rat sires that self-administered cocaine. The information transfer from sire to progeny may occur through epigenetic marks in sperm, encompassing alterations in small noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and/or DNA methylation. Here, no reliable changes in miRNAs in the sperm of cocaine- relative to saline-experienced sires were identified. In contrast, 272 differentially methylated regions were observed in sperm between these groups. Two hypomethylated promoter regions in the sperm of cocaine-experienced rats were upstream of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (<I>Cdkn1a</I>). <I>Cdkn1a</I> mRNA also was selectively increased in the NAc of cocaine-sired male (but not female) offspring. Cocaine self-administration also enhanced <I>Cdkn1a</I> expression in the accumbens of cocaine-sired rats. These results suggest that changes in <I>Cdkn1a</I> may play a role in the reduced cocaine reinforcing efficacy observed in cocaine-sired male rats. Introducing a 90 d delay between sire self-administration and breeding reversed both cocaine resistance and the increase in accumbens <I>Cdkn1a</I> mRNA in male offspring, indicating that cocaine-induced epigenetic modifications are eliminated with sperm turnover. Collectively, our results indicate that cocaine self-administration produces hypomethylation of <I>Cdkn1a</I> in sperm and a selective increase in the expression of this gene in the NAc of male offspring, which is associated with blunted cocaine reinforcement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The relatively new field of transgenerational epigenetics explores the effects of environmental perturbations on offspring behavior and physiology. Our prior work in rats indicated that male, but not female, progeny of sires that self-administered cocaine displayed reduced cocaine reinforcement. The information transfer from sire to progeny may occur through heritable epigenetic marks in sperm, including DNA methylation. The present findings revealed two hypomethylated promoter regions upstream of the <I>Cdkn1a</I> gene in sire sperm. Remarkably, <I>Cdkn1a</I> expression was selectively decreased in offspring NAc, a brain region that regulates cocaine reinforcement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Strong Gamma Frequency Oscillations in the Adolescent Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Working memory ability continues to mature into adulthood in humans and nonhuman primates. At the single-neuron level, adolescent development is characterized by increased prefrontal firing rate in the delay period, but less is known about how coordinated activity between neurons is altered. Local field potentials (LFPs) provide a window into the computations conducted by the local network. To address the effects of adolescent development on LFP activity, three male rhesus monkeys were trained to perform an oculomotor delayed response task and tested at both the adolescent and adult stages. Simultaneous single-unit and LFP signals were recorded from areas 8a and 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In both the cue and delay period, power relative to baseline in the gamma frequency range (32&ndash;128 Hz) was higher in the adolescent than the adult stage. The changes between developmental stages could not be accounted for by differences in performance and were observed in more posterior as well as more anterior recording sites. In the adult stage, high-firing neurons were also more likely to reside at sites with strong gamma power increase from baseline. For both stages, the gamma power increase in the delay was selective for sites with neuron-encoding stimulus information in their spiking. Our results establish gamma power decrease to be a feature of prefrontal cortical maturation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Gamma-frequency oscillations in extracellular field recordings (e.g., local field potential or EEG) are a marker of normal interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neural circuits. Abnormally low gamma power during working memory is seen in conditions such as schizophrenia. We sought to examine whether the immature prefrontal cortex similarly exhibits lower power in the gamma-frequency range during working memory, in a nonhuman primate model of adolescence. Contrary to this expectation, the adolescent PFC exhibited stronger gamma power during the maintenance of working memory. Our findings reveal an unknown developmental maturation trajectory of gamma-band oscillations, propose a refinement of information encoding during PFC maturation, and raise the possibility that schizophrenia represents an excessive state of prefrontal maturation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Drosophila Circuit for Habituation Override</a></h4>

              
                <p>Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability to override habituation is best explained by postulating that habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs onto stimulus-encoding assemblies and that habituation override occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory and gustatory habituation in <I>Drosophila</I>. Here, we analyze how exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory (proboscis extension reflex; PER) habituation. While brief sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes naive <I>Drosophila</I> to extend their proboscis, persistent exposure reduces PER to subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores PER response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic activation of a population of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, a subset of which send projections to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the habituated state, with no effect on the naive sucrose response across a range of concentrations. Taken together with other findings, these observations in female flies are consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly, inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The implications of these findings for general mechanisms of attentional and sensory override of habituation are discussed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Habituation can be overcome when a new context requires an enhanced response to a familiar stimulus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have provided evidence that habituation of the sucrose-induced proboscis extension reflex (PER) in <I>Drosophila</I> occurs through potentiation of inhibition onto the PER pathway. This work defines controlled protocols for override of PER habituation and uses them to outline the underlying circuit mechanisms. The results presented support a model in which novel taste stimuli cause dishabituation by activating a subset of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons that inhibit GABAergic neurons whose potentiation underlies PER habituation. At a general level, these findings further highlight a central role for inhibition and disinhibition in the control of behavioral flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disinhibitory Circuitry Gates Associative Synaptic Plasticity in Olfactory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory microcircuits play an essential role in regulating cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Interneurons that inhibit dendritic or somatic integration act as gatekeepers for neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and the formation of sensory representations. Conversely, interneurons that selectively inhibit other interneurons can open gates through disinhibition. In the anterior piriform cortex, relief of inhibition permits associative LTP of excitatory synapses between pyramidal neurons. However, the interneurons and circuits mediating disinhibition have not been elucidated. In this study, we use an optogenetic approach in mice of both sexes to identify the inhibitory interneurons and disinhibitory circuits that regulate LTP. We focused on three prominent interneuron classes: somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons. We find that LTP is gated by the inactivation SST or PV interneurons and by the activation of VIP interneurons. Further, VIP interneurons strongly inhibit putative SST cells during LTP induction but only weakly inhibit PV interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that VIP interneurons mediate a disinhibitory circuit that gates synaptic plasticity during the formation of olfactory representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibitory interneurons stabilize neural activity during sensory processing. However, inhibition must also be modulated to allow sensory experience shape neural responses. In olfactory cortex, inhibition regulates activity-dependent increases in excitatory synaptic strength that accompany odor learning. We identify two inhibitory interneuron classes that act as gatekeepers preventing excitatory enhancement. We demonstrate that driving a third class of interneurons inhibits the gatekeepers and opens the gate for excitatory enhancement. All three inhibitory neuron classes comprise disinhibitory microcircuit motifs found throughout the cortex. Our findings suggest that a common disinhibitory microcircuit promotes changes in synaptic strength during sensory processing and learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prior Expectations in Visual Speed Perception Predict Encoding Characteristics of Neurons in Area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bayesian inference provides an elegant theoretical framework for understanding the characteristic biases and discrimination thresholds in visual speed perception. However, the framework is difficult to validate because of its flexibility and the fact that suitable constraints on the structure of the sensory uncertainty have been missing. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding not only well explains human visual speed perception but also provides an accurate quantitative account of the tuning characteristics of neurons known for representing visual speed. Specifically, we found that the population coding accuracy for visual speed in area MT ("neural prior") is precisely predicted by the power-law, slow-speed prior extracted from fitting the Bayesian observer model to psychophysical data ("behavioral prior") to the point that the two priors are indistinguishable in a cross-validation model comparison. Our results demonstrate a quantitative validation of the Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding at both the behavioral and neural levels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Statistical regularities of the environment play an important role in shaping both neural representations and perceptual behavior. Most previous work addressed these two aspects independently. Here we present a quantitative validation of a theoretical framework that makes joint predictions for neural coding and behavior, based on the assumption that neural representations of sensory information are efficient but also optimally used in generating a percept. Specifically, we demonstrate that the neural tuning characteristics for visual speed in brain area MT are precisely predicted by the statistical prior expectations extracted from psychophysical data. As such, our results provide a normative link between perceptual behavior and the neural representation of sensory information in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Thalamocortical Mechanisms for Nostalgia-Induced Analgesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>As a predominately positive emotion, nostalgia serves various adaptive functions, including a recently revealed analgesic effect. The current fMRI study aimed to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the nostalgia-induced analgesic effect on noxious thermal stimuli of different intensities. Human participants' (males and females) behavior results showed that the nostalgia paradigm significantly reduced participants' perception of pain, particularly at low pain intensities. fMRI analysis revealed that analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-related brain regions, including the lingual and parahippocampal gyrus. Notably, anterior thalamic activation during the nostalgia stage predicted posterior parietal thalamus activation during the pain stage, suggesting that the thalamus might play a key role as a central functional linkage in the analgesic effect. Moreover, while thalamus-PAG functional connectivity was found to be related to nostalgic strength, periaqueductal gray-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PAG-dlPFC) functional connectivity was found to be associated with pain perception, suggesting possible analgesic modulatory pathways. These findings demonstrate the analgesic effect of nostalgia and, more importantly, shed light on its neural mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nostalgia is known to reduce individuals' perception of physical pain. The underlying brain mechanisms, however, are unclear. Our study found that the thalamus plays a key role as a functional linkage between nostalgia and pain, suggesting a possible analgesic modulatory mechanism of nostalgia. These findings have implications for the underlying brain mechanisms of psychological analgesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emotion Downregulation Targets Interoceptive Brain Regions While Emotion Upregulation Targets Other Affective Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers generally agree that when upregulating and downregulating emotion, control regions in the prefrontal cortex turn up or down activity in affect-generating brain areas. However, the "affective dial hypothesis" that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the regions activated during upregulation and those deactivated during downregulation in 54 male and 51 female humans. We found that upregulation and downregulation both recruit regulatory regions, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, but act on distinct affect-generating regions. Upregulation increased activity in regions associated with emotional experience, such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum, and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity, such as periventricular white matter, while downregulation decreased activity in regions receiving interoceptive input, such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus. Nevertheless, participants' subjective sense of emotional intensity was associated with activity in overlapping brain regions (dorsal anterior cingulate, insula, thalamus, and frontal pole) across upregulation and downregulation. These findings indicate that upregulation and downregulation rely on overlapping brain regions to control and assess emotions but target different affect-generating brain regions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many contexts require modulating one's own emotions. Identifying the brain areas implementing these regulatory processes should advance understanding emotional disorders and designing potential interventions. The emotion regulation field has an implicit assumption we call the affective dial hypothesis: both emotion upregulation and downregulation modulate the same emotion-generating brain areas. Countering the hypothesis, our findings indicate that up- and down-modulating emotions target different brain areas. Thus, the mechanisms underlying emotion regulation might differ more than previously appreciated for upregulation versus downregulation. In addition to their theoretical importance, these findings are critical for researchers attempting to target activity in particular brain regions during an emotion regulation intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Precise and Pervasive Phasic Bursting in Locus Coeruleus during Maternal Behavior in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) mediates key aspects of arousal, memory, and cognition in structured tasks, but its contribution to naturalistic behavior remains unclear. LC activity is thought to multiplex distinct signals by superimposing sustained ("tonic") firing patterns reflecting global brain states, such as arousal and anxiety, and rapidly fluctuating ("phasic") bursts signaling discrete behaviorally significant events. Manipulations of the LC noradrenergic system broadly impair social behavior, but the temporal structure of LC firing and its relationship to social interaction is unknown. One possibility is that tonic firing may increase in the presence of social partners; it is also possible that phasic bursts may accompany specific social events. We used chronic <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology and fiber photometry to measure single-unit and population neural activity in LC of freely behaving mice during their interactions with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits remarkably precise phasic activity in LC that cannot be attributed merely to sensory stimuli, motor activity, or reward. Correlation of LC activity with retrieval events shows that phasic events are most closely related to specific subsequent behaviors. The reliability and magnitude of phasic responses strongly suggest that these events are coordinated across LC and broadcast noradrenaline (NA) release throughout the brain. We also observed slow changes in tonic firing when females performed distinct maternal behaviors such as nest building and pup grooming. We therefore propose that LC signals state changes during sustained interactions and contributes to goal-directed action selection during social behavior with globally broadcast NA release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) brain wide, influencing many cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Multifunctionality of LC is maintained by multiplexing NA signaling via brief "phasic" patterns of bursting and slowly changing "tonic" firing. Manipulations of NA impair social behavior, yet the structure of LC activity with respect to specific social events is unknown. We measured LC activity in mice freely interacting with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits precisely timed and pervasive phasic activation of LC that anticipates specific behaviors. We also found that LC neurons exhibited slow fluctuations in firing during sustained behaviors. We propose that LC simultaneously contributes to goal-directed social action selection with globally broadcast NA release and signals social state changes with increased tonic firing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Context Modulates Encoding and Retrieval of Overlapping Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>Overlap between events can lead to interference because of a trade-off between encoding the present event and retrieving the past event. Temporal context information, "when" something occurred, a defining feature of episodic memory, can cue retrieval of a past event. However, the influence of temporal overlap, or proximity in time, on the mechanisms of interference is unclear. Here, by identifying brain states using scalp EEG from male and female human subjects, we show the extent to which temporal overlap promotes interference and induces retrieval. In this experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to either encode the present event or retrieve a past, overlapping event while perceptual input was held constant. We find that the degree of temporal overlap between events leads to selective interference. Specifically, greater temporal overlap between two events leads to impaired memory for the past event selectively when the top-down goal is to encode the present event. Using pattern classification analyses to measure neural evidence for a retrieval state, we find that greater temporal overlap leads to automatic retrieval of a past event, independent of top-down goals. Critically, the retrieval evidence we observe likely reflects a general retrieval mode, rather than retrieval success or effort. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of temporal overlap on interference and memory formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When a present event overlaps with an event from the past, this leads to a trade-off between the tendency to encode the present event versus retrieve the past event. Here we show that, when two events are experienced nearby in time, the memory system is biased toward a retrieval state and that subsequent memory for the past event is impaired. These findings suggest an influence of bottom-up temporal factors on both interference and the trade-off between memory states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">S-Nitrosylation of p62 Inhibits Autophagic Flux to Promote {alpha}-Synuclein Secretion and Spread in Parkinson's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysregulation of autophagic pathways leads to accumulation of abnormal proteins and damaged organelles in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Autophagy-related dysfunction may also trigger secretion and spread of misfolded proteins, such as &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn), the major misfolded protein found in PD/LBD. However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena remains largely unknown. Here, we used cell-based models, including human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and male transgenic PD/LBD mice, plus vetting in human postmortem brains (both male and female). We provide mechanistic insight into this pathologic pathway. We find that aberrant S-nitrosylation of the autophagic adaptor protein p62 causes inhibition of autophagic flux and intracellular buildup of misfolded proteins, with consequent secretion resulting in cell-to-cell spread. Thus, our data show that pathologic protein S-nitrosylation of p62 represents a critical factor not only for autophagic inhibition and demise of individual neurons, but also for &alpha;-syn release and spread of disease throughout the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, dysfunctional autophagy contributes to accumulation and spread of aggregated &alpha;-synuclein. Here, we provide evidence that protein S-nitrosylation of p62 inhibits autophagic flux, contributing to &alpha;-synuclein aggregation and spread.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adaptive Mossy Cell Circuit Plasticity after Status Epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hilar mossy cells regulate network function in the hippocampus through both direct excitation and di-synaptic inhibition of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Substantial mossy cell loss accompanies hippocampal circuit changes in epilepsy. We examined the contribution of surviving mossy cells to network activity in the reorganized dentate gyrus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). To examine functional circuit changes, we optogenetically stimulated mossy cells in acute hippocampal slices from male mice. In control mice, activation of mossy cells produced monosynaptic excitatory and di-synaptic GABAergic currents in DGCs. In pilocarpine-treated mice, mossy cell density and excitation of DGCs were reduced in parallel, with only a minimal reduction in feedforward inhibition, enhancing the inhibition/excitation ratio. Surprisingly, mossy cell-driven excitation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells, primary mediators of feed-forward inhibition, was maintained. Our results suggest that mossy cell outputs reorganize following seizures, increasing their net inhibitory effect in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hilar mossy cell loss in epilepsy is associated with hippocampal hyperexcitability, potentially as a result of disrupted dentate microcircuit function. We used transgenic mice, translational mouse modeling, viral vectors, and optogenetics to selectively examine functional changes to mossy cell outputs following status epilepticus (SE). Interestingly, the outputs of surviving mossy cells exhibited adaptive plasticity onto target parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, resulting in a relative increase in their inhibitory control of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Our findings suggest that residual mossy cell outputs can reorganize in a homeostatic manner, which may provide clues for therapeutic targeting of this microcircuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Progressive Build-up of Perineuronal Nets in the Somatosensory Cortex Is Associated with the Development of Chronic Pain in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic pain is sustained by a maladaptive form of neuronal plasticity occurring in all stations of the pain neuraxis, including cortical regions of the pain matrix. We report that chronic inflammatory pain induced by unilateral injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the hindpaw of male mice was associated with a progressive build-up of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (SSC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and reticular thalamic nucleus. In the SSC, the density of PNNs labeled by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) was increased at both 3 and 7 d following CFA injection, but only after 7 d in the mPFC. The number of parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons enwrapped by WFA<sup>+</sup>/PNNs was also increased in all three brain regions of mice injected with CFA. Remarkably, PNN degradation induced by intracortical infusion of chondroitinase-ABC significantly reduced mechanical and thermal pain, and also reversed the increased frequency of IPSCs recorded in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the contralateral SSC in CFA-injected mice. These findings suggest a possible relationship between cortical PNNs and nociceptive sensitization, and support the hypothesis that PNNs maintain their plasticity in the adult life and regulate cortical responses to sensory inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain extracellular matrix not only provides structural support, but also regulates synapse formation and function, and modulates neuronal excitability. We found that chronic inflammatory pain in mice enhances the density of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Remarkably, enzymatic degradation of PNNs in the somatosensory cortex caused analgesia and reversed alterations of inhibitory synaptic transmission associated with chronic pain. These findings disclose a novel mechanism of nociceptive sensitization and support a role for PNNs in mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult brain.</p>

                <p>Anxiety disorders are a series of mental disorders characterized by anxiety and fear, but the molecular basis of these disorders remains unclear. In the present study, we find that the global <I>Slack KO</I> male mice exhibit anxious behaviors, whereas the Slack <I>Y777H</I> male mice manifest anxiolytic behaviors. The expression of Slack channels is rich in basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic neurons and downregulated in chronic corticosterone-treated mice. In addition, electrophysiological data show enhanced excitability of BLA glutamatergic neurons in the <I>Slack KO</I> mice and decreased excitability of these neurons in the <I>Slack Y777H</I> mice. Furthermore, the Slack channel deletion in BLA glutamatergic neurons is sufficient to result in enhanced avoidance behaviors, whereas <I>Kcnt1</I> gene expression in the BLA or BLA&ndash;ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections reverses anxious behaviors of the <I>Slack KO</I> mice. Our study identifies the role of the Slack channel in controlling anxious behaviors by decreasing the excitability of BLA&ndash;vHPC glutamatergic projections, providing a potential target for anxiolytic therapies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety disorders are a series of mental disorders characterized by anxiety and fear, but the molecular basis of these disorders remains unclear. Here, we examined the behaviors of loss- and gain-of-function of Slack channel mice in elevated plus maze and open field tests and found the anxiolytic role of the Slack channel. By altering the Slack channel expression in the specific neuronal circuit, we demonstrated that the Slack channel played its anxiolytic role by decreasing the excitability of BLA&ndash;vHPC glutamatergic projections. Our data reveal the role of the Slack channel in the regulation of anxiety, which may provide a potential molecular target for anxiolytic therapies.</p>

<p>In the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>), each note of its rapid frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by modulation of larynx, breath, and gape. To elucidate the circuitry underlying song, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into two vocal muscles. We observed infection in separate motorneuron pools for each muscle, then coinfection in putative central pattern generators, followed by forebrain hypothalamic and limbic regions, and finally cortex. Our data suggest hierarchical song control resembles known circuits for both rodents and primates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocalizations are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. The progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing clinical dosing of combination broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV prevention</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bryan T. Mayer, Allan C. deCamp, Yunda Huang, Joshua T. Schiffer, Raphael Gottardo, Peter B. Gilbert, Daniel B. Reeves</p>

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are promising agents to prevent HIV infection and achieve HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART). As with ART, bNAb combinations are likely needed to cover HIV’s extensive diversity. Not all bNAbs are identical in terms of their breadth, potency, and <i>in vivo</i> longevity (half-life). Given these differences, it is important to optimally select the composition, or dose ratio, of combination bNAb therapies for future clinical studies. We developed a model that synthesizes 1) pharmacokinetics, 2) potency against a wide HIV diversity, 3) interaction models for how drugs work together, and 4) correlates that translate <i>in vitro</i> potency to clinical protection. We found optimization requires drug-specific balances between potency, longevity, and interaction type. As an example, tradeoffs between longevity and potency are shown by comparing a combination therapy to a bi-specific antibody (a single protein merging both bNAbs) that takes the better potency but the worse longevity of the two components. Then, we illustrate a realistic dose ratio optimization of a triple combination of VRC07, 3BNC117, and 10–1074 bNAbs. We apply protection estimates derived from both a non-human primate (NHP) challenge study meta-analysis and the human antibody mediated prevention (AMP) trials. In both cases, we find a 2:1:1 dose emphasizing VRC07 is nearly optimal. Our approach can be immediately applied to optimize the next generation of combination antibody prevention and cure studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epigenetic cell memory: The gene’s inner chromatin modification circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simone Bruno, Ruth J. Williams, Domitilla Del Vecchio</p>

Epigenetic cell memory allows distinct gene expression patterns to persist in different cell types despite a common genotype. Although different patterns can be maintained by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), it was proposed that long-term persistence hinges on chromatin state. Here, we study how the dynamics of chromatin state affect memory, and focus on a biologically motivated circuit motif, among histones and DNA modifications, that mediates the action of TFs on gene expression. Memory arises from time-scale separation among three circuit’s constituent processes: basal erasure, auto and cross-catalysis, and recruited erasure of modifications. When the two latter processes are sufficiently faster than the former, the circuit exhibits bistability and hysteresis, allowing active and repressed gene states to coexist and persist after TF stimulus removal. The duration of memory is stochastic with a mean value that increases as time-scale separation increases, but more so for the repressed state. This asymmetry stems from the cross-catalysis between repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation and is enhanced by the relatively slower decay rate of the latter. Nevertheless, TF-mediated positive autoregulation can rebalance this asymmetry and even confers robustness of active states to repressive stimuli. More generally, by wiring positively autoregulated chromatin modification circuits under time scale separation, long-term distinct gene expression patterns arise, which are also robust to failure in the regulatory links.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dowker complex based machine learning (DCML) models for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiang Liu, Huitao Feng, Jie Wu, Kelin Xia</p>

With the great advancements in experimental data, computational power and learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) based drug design has begun to gain momentum recently. AI-based drug design has great promise to revolutionize pharmaceutical industries by significantly reducing the time and cost in drug discovery processes. However, a major issue remains for all AI-based learning model that is efficient molecular representations. Here we propose Dowker complex (DC) based molecular interaction representations and Riemann Zeta function based molecular featurization, for the first time. Molecular interactions between proteins and ligands (or others) are modeled as Dowker complexes. A multiscale representation is generated by using a filtration process, during which a series of DCs are generated at different scales. Combinatorial (Hodge) Laplacian matrices are constructed from these DCs, and the Riemann zeta functions from their spectral information can be used as molecular descriptors. To validate our models, we consider protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our DC-based machine learning (DCML) models, in particular, DC-based gradient boosting tree (DC-GBT), are tested on three most-commonly used datasets, i.e., including PDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013 and PDBbind-2016, and extensively compared with other existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our DC-based descriptors can achieve the state-of-the-art results and have better performance than all machine learning models with traditional molecular descriptors. Our Dowker complex based machine learning models can be used in other tasks in AI-based drug design and molecular data analysis.

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

                Dr. John Q. Trojanowski made myriad highly influential contributions to the fields of neurodegeneration, neuropathology, and the broader neurosciences over the span of 50 years, almost all of them alongside Virginia Lee, his lifelong partner and scientific collaborator. His work transformed our understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, and Parkinson’s disease. John died on February 8, 2022, in Philadelphia, due to complications associated with spinal cord injuries following a fall shortly after his 75th birthday.

                How do humans and other animals make the decision to explore new options instead of exploiting familiar favorites? Hogeveen et al. find evidence for similar computations underlying explore-exploit decisions across humans and monkeys. Additionally, their study reveals a brain-wide network comprising frontopolar, frontoparietal, frontostriatal, and mesocorticolimbic regions underlying explore-exploit decisions.
