              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of 1480 nm and 980 nm-pumped Gallium-Erbium fiber amplifier [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One way to reduce the length of the gain medium in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) is by doping the fiber core with a high concentration of Erbium. However, this method caused ion clustering effects, which limits the EDFA’s efficiency.  In this research, the use of Gallium as a new co-dopant in erbium-doped silica fiber is explored. Methods: The new fiber, namely Gallium co-doped Erbium fiber (Ga-EDF), is used as a gain medium in an optical fiber amplifier setup. A 2-meter length of the Ga-EDF fiber was used in a single pass configuration with a forward pumping scheme at 150 mW pump power. The Ga-EDF amplifier's gain and noise figure while pumping at 980 nm and 1480 nm were compared. The amplifier's performance was evaluated as the input signal power varied between -30 dBm to 3 dBm, over the wavelength range of 1520 nm to 1580 nm. Results: The 980 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier achieved the maximum small-signal gain of 22.45 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.71 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1535 nm. Meanwhile, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier attained the maximum small-signal gain of 20.83 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.09 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1550 nm. At the input signal power below -20 dBm and the wavelength range 1520 nm to 1547 nm, the Ga-EDF performs better when pumped at 980 nm. Their performance is comparable at the input signal wavelength range between 1547 nm to 1580 nm. At the input signal power above -20 dBm, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF outperformed the 980 nm-pumped amplifier. Conclusions: The overall performance indicates that the gain saturation point of the 1480 nm-pumped amplifier is higher than the 980 nm-pumped.

                Vitellogenin receptor (VgR) plays a pivotal role in ovarian vitellogenin (Vg) uptake and vertical transmission of pathogenic microbes and Wolbachia symbionts. However, the regulatory mechanisms of VgR action as an endocytic receptor and translocation from oocyte cytoplasm to the membrane remain poorly understood. Here, by using the migratory locust Locusta...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroscience has been transformed by the ability to genetically modify inbred mice, including the ability to express fluorescent markers specific to cell types or activation states. This approach has been put to particularly good effect in the study of the innate immune cells of the brain, microglia. These specialized macrophages are exceedingly small and complex, but also highly motile and mobile. To date, there have been no tools similar to those in mice available for studying these fundamental cells in the rat brain, and we seek to fill that gap with the generation of the genetically modified Sprague Dawley rat line: <I>SD-Tg(Iba1-EGFP)Mmmc</I>. Using CRISPR-Cas/9 technology, we knocked in <I>EGFP</I> to the promoter of the gene <I>Iba1</I>. With four male and three female founders confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis to have appropriate and specific insertion, we established a breeding colony with at least three generations of backcrosses to obtain stable and reliable Iba1-EGFP expression. The specificity of EGFP expression to microglia was established by flow cytometry for CD45<sup>low</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and by immunohistochemistry. Microglial EGFP expression was detected in neonates and persisted into adulthood. Blood macrophages and monocytes were found to express low levels of EGFP, as expected. Last, we show that EGFP expression is suitable for live imaging of microglia processes in acute brain slices and via intravital two-photon microscopy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Postdiction: When Temporal Regularity Drives Space Perception through Prestimulus Alpha Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In postdiction, the last stimulus of a sequence changes the perception of the preceding stimuli. Postdiction has been reported in all sensory modalities, but its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. In the rabbit illusion, a sequence of nonequidistant stimuli presented isochronously is perceived as equidistantly spaced. This illusion might be driven by an internal prior favoring a constant-speed motion. Here, we hypothesized that prestimulus alpha oscillations (8&ndash;12 Hz), known to correlate with perceptual expectations and biases, would reflect the degree to which perceptual reports are influenced by a constant-speed prior. Human participants were presented with ambiguous visual sequences while being recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG: the same sequences yielded an illusory perception in about half the trials, allowing contrasting brain responses elicited by identical sequences causing distinct percepts. As a proxy of an individual&rsquo;s prior, we used the percentage of perceived illusion and the detection criterion, assuming that a strong constant-speed prior would result in a higher rate of illusory percepts. We found that high frontoparietal alpha power was associated with perceiving the sequence according to the individual&rsquo;s prior: participants with high susceptibility to the illusion would report the illusion, while participants with low susceptibility would report the veridical sequence. Additionally, we found that prestimulus alpha phase in occipitoparietal regions dissociated illusion from no-illusion trials. We interpret our results as suggesting that alpha power reflects an individual&rsquo;s constant-speed prior, whereas alpha phase modulates sensory uncertainty.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation above the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Facilitates Decision-Making following Periods of Low Outcome Controllability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent studies suggest that choice behavior in reinforcement learning tasks is shaped by the level of outcome controllability. In particular, Pavlovian bias (PB) seems to be enhanced under low levels of control, manifesting in approach tendencies toward rewards and response inhibition when facing potential losses. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated both in evaluating outcome controllability and in the recruitment of cognitive control (CC) to suppress maladaptive PB during reinforcement learning. The current study tested whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) above the mPFC of healthy humans can influence PB, and counteract the previously documented, deleterious behavioral effects of low outcome controllability on decision-making. In a preregistered, between-group, double-blind study (<I>N</I> = 103 adults, both sexes), we tested the interaction between controllability and HD-tDCS on parameters of choice behavior in a Go/NoGo task. Relative to sham stimulation, HD-tDCS resulted in more robust performance improvement following reduced control, an effect that was more pronounced in appetitive trials. In addition, we found evidence for weaker PB when HD-tDCS was administered during low controllability over outcomes. Computational modeling revealed that parameter estimates of learning rate and choice randomness were modulated by controllability, HD-tDCS and their interaction. Overall, these results highlight the potential of our HD-tDCS protocol for interfering with choice arbitration under low levels of control, resulting in more adaptive behavior.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In recent years there has been extensive research on malformations of cortical development (MCDs) that result in clinical features like developmental delay, intellectual disability, and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Various studies highlighted the contribution of microtubule-associated genes (including tubulin and kinesin encoding genes) in MCD development. It has been reported that <I>de novo</I> mutations in <I>KIF2A</I>, a member of the <I>kinesin-13</I> family, are linked to brain malformations and DRE. Although it is known that KIF2A functions by regulating microtubule depolymerization via an ATP-driven process, <I>in vivo</I> implications of <I>KIF2A</I> loss of function remain partly unclear. Here, we present a novel <I>kif2a</I> knock-out zebrafish model, showing hypoactivity, habituation deficits, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure susceptibility and microcephaly, as well as neuronal cell proliferation defects and increased apoptosis. Interestingly, <I>kif2a</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae survived until adulthood and were fertile. Notably, our <I>kif2a</I> zebrafish knock-out model demonstrated many phenotypic similarities to <I>KIF2A</I> mouse models. This study provides valuable insights into the functional importance of <I>kif2a</I> in zebrafish and phenotypical hallmarks related to <I>KIF2A</I> mutations. Ultimately, this model could be used in a future search for more effective therapies that alleviate the clinical symptoms typically associated with MCDs.</p>

                <p>Molecular, anatomic, and behavioral studies show that the hippocampus is structurally and functionally heterogeneous, with dorsal hippocampus implicated in mnemonic processes and spatial navigation and ventral hippocampus involved in affective processes. By performing electrophysiological recordings of large neuronal populations in dorsal and ventral CA1 in head-fixed mice navigating a virtual environment, we found that this diversity resulted in different strategies for population coding of space. Populations of neurons in dorsal CA1 showed more complex patterns of activity, which resulted in a higher dimensionality of neural representations that translated to more information being encoded, as compared ensembles in vCA1. Furthermore, a pairwise maximum entropy model was better at predicting the structure of these global patterns of activity in ventral CA1 as compared with dorsal CA1. Taken together, the different coding strategies we uncovered likely emerge from anatomic and physiological differences along the longitudinal axis of hippocampus and that may, in turn, underpin the divergent ethological roles of dorsal and ventral CA1.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory synaptic inputs arriving at the dendrites of a neuron can engage active mechanisms that nonlinearly amplify the depolarizing currents. This supralinear synaptic integration is subject to modulation by inhibition. However, the specific rules by which different subtypes of interneurons affect the modulation have remained largely elusive. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of the following two subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons; and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on NMDA receptors. Optogenetic activation of SST interneurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the supralinear response without affecting its threshold. PV interneuron activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on the supralinear response. Together, these results delineate the roles for SST and PV neurons in active synaptic integration. Differential effects of inhibition by SST and PV interneurons likely increase the computational capacity of the pyramidal neurons in modulating the nonlinear integration of synaptic output.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Throughout the nervous system, the organization of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs within a neuron&rsquo;s receptive field shapes its output computation. In some cases, multiple motifs of synaptic organization can contribute to a single computation. Here, we compare two of these mechanisms performed by two morphologically distinct retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs): directionally tuned inhibition and spatially offset inhibition. Using drifting stimuli, we found that DSGCs that have asymmetric dendrites exhibited stronger directionally tuned inhibition than symmetric DSGCs. Using stationary stimuli to map receptive fields, we found that DSGCs with both symmetric and asymmetric dendrites exhibited similar spatially offset inhibition. Interestingly, we observed that excitatory and inhibitory synapses for both cell types were locally correlated in strength. This result indicates that in the mouse retina, dendritic morphology influences the amount of tuned inhibition attained through asymmetric wiring but does not dictate the synaptic organization of excitation relative to inhibition.</p>

                <p>Spatial orientation memory plays a crucial role in animal navigation. Recent studies of tethered <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> (fruit fly) in a virtual reality setting showed that the head direction is encoded in the form of an activity bump, i.e., localized neural activity, in the torus-shaped ellipsoid body (EB). However, how this system is involved in orientation working memory is not well understood. We investigated this question using free moving flies (<I>D. melanogaster</I>) in a spatial orientation memory task by manipulating two EB subsystems, C and P circuits, which are hypothesized for stabilizing and updating the activity bump, respectively. To this end, we suppressed or activated two types of inhibitory ring neurons (EIP and P) which innervate EB, and we discovered that manipulating the two inhibitory neuron types produced distinct behavioral deficits, suggesting specific roles of the inhibitory neurons in coordinating the stabilization and updating functions of the EB circuits. We further elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying such control circuits using a connectome-constrained spiking neural network model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparing carbon emissions between online and in-person study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO2 emissions through not attending university in-person offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Therapy for patients with asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Though coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been designated as a global pandemic, its nature as a viral infection means that it is essentially a self-limiting disease. We studied the application of symptomatic, isolation, relaxation, nutrition and observation (SIRNO) therapy in patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms of COVID-19 at a rescue hospital in Indonesia. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 2122 patients who were admitted to Indrapura Field Hospital in Surabaya from 28 May 2020 to 20 September 2020. We analyzed demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory data, therapy and clinical outcomes. Result: The total sample of 2122 patients consisted of 1403 male patients (66.12%), and 719 female patients (33.88 %). The most common age range was 26-45 years, at 52.54% (1115 patients). The clinical symptoms of 1121 patients (52.8%) were asymptomatic, 977 patients (46%) had mild symptoms, and 24 patients (0.1%) had moderate symptoms. All patients received the SIRNO therapy method. From a total of 2122 patients, 1930 patients (90.9%) were cured, 181 patients (8.5%) are still being treated, seven patients (0.03%) were referred for indications of desaturation (SpO2 <94%), and four patients (0.01%) were moved to a referral hospital. Until 20 September 2020, the final date studied, there were no patient deaths. Conclusion: The SIRNO method provides excellent results in the management of COVID-19 at a rescue hospital for patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms. Economic pharmacological research can initiate a follow-up study in order to objectively measure the effectiveness and efficiency of SIRNO treatment methods in patients with asymptomatic, mild symptoms of COVID-19, and the small number of 24 patients (0,.1%) with moderate symptoms.

                Background: We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT), evaluating the effectiveness of the inclusion of a pen with a postal questionnaire, compared to no pen being included, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial. Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the KReBS trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Results: In total, 2305 participants were randomised into the SWAT. In the pen group, 1020/1145 (89.1%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 982/1147 (85.6%) in the no pen group. The absolute difference in questionnaire return rate was 3.5% (95% CI: 0.8% to 6.2%; p=0.01). There were statistically significant differences in questionnaire return rate (OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.74; p=0.02), questionnaire completion rate (OR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.78; p<0.01) and time to questionnaire return (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.27; p<0.01) favouring the pen group. Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether pens are effective as an incentive for retention, and indicates their potential effectiveness. Registration: KReBS trial registered on 20 February 2019, ID ISRCTN87127065; SWAT registered on 1 April 2019, ID SWAT92.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perspectives on automated composition of workflows in the life sciences [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus. This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the “big picture” of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years. A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural and energetic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibody recognition and the impact of circulating variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rui Yin, Johnathan D. Guest, Ghazaleh Taherzadeh, Ragul Gowthaman, Ipsa Mittra, Jane Quackenbush, Brian G. Pierce</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for a detailed molecular understanding of protective antibody responses. This is underscored by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), some of which appear to be less effectively targeted by current monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies, using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures, we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering. We also identified the energetic and conservation features of epitope residues and assessed the capacity of viral variant mutations to disrupt antibody recognition, revealing sets of antibodies predicted to effectively target recently described viral variants. This detailed structure-based reference of antibody RBD recognition signatures can inform therapeutic and vaccine design strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ReFeaFi: Genome-wide prediction of regulatory elements driving transcription initiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramzan Umarov, Yu Li, Takahiro Arakawa, Satoshi Takizawa, Xin Gao, Erik Arner</p>

Regulatory elements control gene expression through transcription initiation (promoters) and by enhancing transcription at distant regions (enhancers). Accurate identification of regulatory elements is fundamental for annotating genomes and understanding gene expression patterns. While there are many attempts to develop computational promoter and enhancer identification methods, reliable tools to analyze long genomic sequences are still lacking. Prediction methods often perform poorly on the genome-wide scale because the number of negatives is much higher than that in the training sets. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic negative set updating scheme with a two-model approach, using one model for scanning the genome and the other one for testing candidate positions. The developed method achieves good genome-level performance and maintains robust performance when applied to other vertebrate species, without re-training. Moreover, the unannotated predicted regulatory regions made on the human genome are enriched for disease-associated variants, suggesting them to be potentially true regulatory elements rather than false positives. We validated high scoring “false positive” predictions using reporter assay and all tested candidates were successfully validated, demonstrating the ability of our method to discover novel human regulatory regions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weihsueh A. Chiu, Martial L. Ndeffo-Mbah</p>

Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% [CrI: 12.3%-14.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% [CrI: 0.1%-0.3%] in Hawaii to 2.8% [CrI: 1.8%-4.1%] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% [CrI: 1.2%-2.0%] in Vermont to 23% [CrI: 20%-28%] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ascension of Chlamydia is moderated by uterine peristalsis and the neutrophil response to infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Torrington Callan, Stephen Woodcock, Wilhelmina May Huston</p>

<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is a common sexually transmitted infection that is associated with a range of serious reproductive tract sequelae including in women Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), tubal factor infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Ascension of the pathogen beyond the cervix and into the upper reproductive tract is thought to be necessary for these pathologies. However, <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> does not encode a mechanism for movement on its genome, and so the processes that facilitate ascension have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluate the factors that may influence chlamydial ascension in women. We constructed a mathematical model based on a set of stochastic dynamics to elucidate the moderating factors that might influence ascension of infections in the first month of an infection. In the simulations conducted from the stochastic model, 36% of infections ascended, but only 9% had more than 1000 bacteria ascend. The results of the simulations indicated that infectious load and the peristaltic contractions moderate ascension and are inter-related in impact. Smaller initial loads were much more likely to ascend. Ascension was found to be dependent on the neutrophil response. Overall, our results indicate that infectious load, menstrual cycle timing, and the neutrophil response are critical factors in chlamydial ascension in women.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale model of defective interfering particle replication for influenza A virus infection in animal cell culture</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Rüdiger, Lars Pelz, Marc D. Hein, Sascha Y. Kupke, Udo Reichl</p>

Cell culture-derived defective interfering particles (DIPs) are considered for antiviral therapy due to their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) production. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) rendering them replication-incompetent. However, they can propagate alongside their homologous standard virus (STV) during infection in a competition for cellular and viral resources. So far, experimental and modeling studies for IAV have focused on either the intracellular or the cell population level when investigating the interaction of STVs and DIPs. To examine these levels simultaneously, we conducted a series of experiments using highly different multiplicities of infections for STVs and DIPs to characterize virus replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney suspension cells. At several time points post infection, we quantified virus titers, viable cell concentration, virus-induced apoptosis using imaging flow cytometry, and intracellular levels of vRNA and viral mRNA using real-time reverse transcription qPCR. Based on the obtained data, we developed a mathematical multiscale model of STV and DIP co-infection that describes dynamics closely for all scenarios with a single set of parameters. We show that applying high DIP concentrations can shut down STV propagation completely and prevent virus-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the three observed viral mRNAs (full-length segment 1 and 5, defective interfering segment 1) accumulated to vastly different levels suggesting the interplay between an internal regulation mechanism and a growth advantage for shorter viral RNAs. Furthermore, model simulations predict that the concentration of DIPs should be at least 10000 times higher than that of STVs to prevent the spread of IAV. Ultimately, the model presented here supports a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between STVs and DIPs during co-infection providing an ideal platform for the prediction and optimization of vaccine manufacturing as well as DIP production for therapeutic use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Episome partitioning and symmetric cell divisions: Quantifying the role of random events in the persistence of HPV infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Beneteau, Christian Selinger, Mircea T. Sofonea, Samuel Alizon</p>

Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) are one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STI) and the most oncogenic viruses known to humans. The vast majority of HPV infections clear in less than 3 years, but the underlying mechanisms, especially the involvement of the immune response, are still poorly known. Building on earlier work stressing the importance of randomness in the type of cell divisions in the clearance of HPV infection, we develop a stochastic mathematical model of HPV dynamics that combines the previous aspect with an explicit description of the intracellular level. We show that the random partitioning of virus episomes upon stem cell division and the occurrence of symmetric divisions dramatically affect viral persistence. These results call for more detailed within-host studies to better understand the relative importance of stochasticity and immunity in HPV infection clearance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kris V. Parag</p>

We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. We find that this combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions significantly reduces the bias and variance of R estimates. Moreover, these properties make EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where several existing methods can become destabilised. As a result, EpiFilter offers improved inference of time-varying transmission patterns that are advantageous for assessing the risk of upcoming waves of infection or the influence of interventions, in real time and at various spatial scales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational modeling of blood component transport related to coronary artery thrombosis in Kawasaki disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noelia Grande Gutiérrez, Mark Alber, Andrew M. Kahn, Jane C. Burns, Mathew Mathew, Brian W. McCrindle, Alison L. Marsden</p>

Coronary artery thrombosis is the major risk associated with Kawasaki disease (KD). Long-term management of KD patients with persistent aneurysms requires a thrombotic risk assessment and clinical decisions regarding the administration of anticoagulation therapy. Computational fluid dynamics has demonstrated that abnormal KD coronary artery hemodynamics can be associated with thrombosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of clot formation are not yet fully understood. Here we present a new model incorporating data from patient-specific simulated velocity fields to track platelet activation and accumulation. We use a system of Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equations solved with a stabilized finite element method to describe the evolution of non-activated platelets and activated platelet concentrations [AP], local concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and poly-phosphate (PolyP). The activation of platelets is modeled as a function of shear-rate exposure and local concentration of agonists. We compared the distribution of activated platelets in a healthy coronary case and six cases with coronary artery aneurysms caused by KD, including three with confirmed thrombosis. Results show spatial correlation between regions of higher concentration of activated platelets and the reported location of the clot, suggesting predictive capabilities of this model towards identifying regions at high risk for thrombosis. Also, the concentration levels of ADP and PolyP in cases with confirmed thrombosis are higher than the reported critical values associated with platelet aggregation (ADP) and activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (PolyP). These findings suggest the potential initiation of a coagulation pathway even in the absence of an extrinsic factor. Finally, computational simulations show that in regions of flow stagnation, biochemical activation, as a result of local agonist concentration, is dominant. Identifying the leading factors to a pro-coagulant environment in each case—mechanical or biochemical—could help define improved strategies for thrombosis prevention tailored for each patient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Bayesian model based computational analysis of the relationship between bisulfite accessible single-stranded DNA in chromatin and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guojun Yu, Yingru Wu, Zhi Duan, Catherine Tang, Haipeng Xing, Matthew D. Scharff, Thomas MacCarthy</p>

The B cells in our body generate protective antibodies by introducing somatic hypermutations (SHM) into the variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IgVs). The mutations are generated by activation induced deaminase (AID) that converts cytosine to uracil in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated during transcription. Attempts have been made to correlate SHM with ssDNA using bisulfite to chemically convert cytosines that are accessible in the intact chromatin of mutating B cells. These studies have been complicated by using different definitions of “bisulfite accessible regions” (BARs). Recently, deep-sequencing has provided much larger datasets of such regions but computational methods are needed to enable this analysis. Here we leveraged the deep-sequencing approach with unique molecular identifiers and developed a novel Hidden Markov Model based Bayesian Segmentation algorithm to characterize the ssDNA regions in the IGHV4-34 gene of the human Ramos B cell line. Combining hierarchical clustering and our new Bayesian model, we identified recurrent BARs in certain subregions of both top and bottom strands of this gene. Using this new system, the average size of BARs is about 15 bp. We also identified potential G-quadruplex DNA structures in this gene and found that the BARs co-locate with G-quadruplex structures in the opposite strand. Using various correlation analyses, there is not a direct site-to-site relationship between the bisulfite accessible ssDNA and all sites of SHM but most of the highly AID mutated sites are within 15 bp of a BAR. In summary, we developed a novel platform to study single stranded DNA in chromatin at a base pair resolution that reveals potential relationships among BARs, SHM and G-quadruplexes. This platform could be applied to genome wide studies in the future.

Outbreak investigations use data from interviews, healthcare providers, laboratories and surveillance systems. However, integrated use of data from multiple sources requires a patchwork of software that present challenges in usability, interoperability, confidentiality, and cost. Rapid integration, visualization and analysis of data from multiple sources can guide effective public health interventions. We developed MicrobeTrace to facilitate rapid public health responses by overcoming barriers to data integration and exploration in molecular epidemiology. MicrobeTrace is a web-based, client-side, JavaScript application (https://microbetrace.cdc.gov) that runs in Chromium-based browsers and remains fully operational without an internet connection. Using publicly available data, we demonstrate the analysis of viral genetic distance networks and introduce a novel approach to minimum spanning trees that simplifies results. We also illustrate the potential utility of MicrobeTrace in support of contact tracing by analyzing and displaying data from an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea in early 2020. MicrobeTrace is developed and actively maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Users can email microbetrace@cdc.gov for support. The source code is available at https://github.com/cdcgov/microbetrace.

Electrical stimulation and block of peripheral nerves hold great promise for treatment of a range of disease and disorders, but promising results from preclinical studies often fail to translate to successful clinical therapies. Differences in neural anatomy across species require different electrodes and stimulation parameters to achieve equivalent nerve responses, and accounting for the consequences of these factors is difficult. We describe the implementation, validation, and application of a standardized, modular, and scalable computational modeling pipeline for biophysical simulations of electrical activation and block of nerve fibers within peripheral nerves. The ASCENT (Automated Simulations to Characterize Electrical Nerve Thresholds) pipeline provides a suite of built-in capabilities for user control over the entire workflow, including libraries for parts to assemble electrodes, electrical properties of biological materials, previously published fiber models, and common stimulation waveforms. We validated the accuracy of ASCENT calculations, verified usability in beta release, and provide several compelling examples of ASCENT-implemented models. ASCENT will enable the reproducibility of simulation data, and it will be used as a component of integrated simulations with other models (e.g., organ system models), to interpret experimental results, and to design experimental and clinical interventions for the advancement of peripheral nerve stimulation therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pathway analysis in metabolomics: Recommendations for the use of over-representation analysis</a></h4>

Over-representation analysis (ORA) is one of the commonest pathway analysis approaches used for the functional interpretation of metabolomics datasets. Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention. Using five publicly available datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc), led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Factors that are specific to metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound identification and the chemical bias of different analytical platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing mutational pathways to lopinavir resistance in HIV-1 subtypes B versus C</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susana Posada-Céspedes, Gert Van Zyl, Hesam Montazeri, Jack Kuipers, Soo-Yon Rhee, Roger Kouyos, Huldrych F. Günthard, Niko Beerenwinkel</p>

Although combination antiretroviral therapies seem to be effective at controlling HIV-1 infections regardless of the viral subtype, there is increasing evidence for subtype-specific drug resistance mutations. The order and rates at which resistance mutations accumulate in different subtypes also remain poorly understood. Most of this knowledge is derived from studies of subtype B genotypes, despite not being the most abundant subtype worldwide. Here, we present a methodology for the comparison of mutational networks in different HIV-1 subtypes, based on Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (H-CBN), a probabilistic model for inferring mutational networks from cross-sectional genotype data. We introduce a Monte Carlo sampling scheme for learning H-CBN models for a larger number of resistance mutations and develop a statistical test to assess differences in the inferred mutational networks between two groups. We apply this method to infer the temporal progression of mutations conferring resistance to the protease inhibitor lopinavir in a large cross-sectional cohort of HIV-1 subtype C genotypes from South Africa, as well as to a data set of subtype B genotypes obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We find strong support for different initial mutational events in the protease, namely at residue 46 in subtype B and at residue 82 in subtype C. The inferred mutational networks for subtype B versus C are significantly different sharing only five constraints on the order of accumulating mutations with mutation at residue 54 as the parental event. The results also suggest that mutations can accumulate along various alternative paths within subtypes, as opposed to a unique total temporal ordering. Beyond HIV drug resistance, the statistical methodology is applicable more generally for the comparison of inferred mutational networks between any two groups.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A systemic cell cycle block impacts stage-specific histone modification profiles during Xenopus embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniil Pokrovsky, Ignasi Forné, Tobias Straub, Axel Imhof, Ralph A. W. Rupp</p>

Forming an embryo from a zygote poses an apparent conflict for epigenetic regulation. On the one hand, the de novo induction of cell fate identities requires the establishment and subsequent maintenance of epigenetic information to harness developmental gene expression. On the other hand, the embryo depends on cell proliferation, and every round of DNA replication dilutes preexisting histone modifications by incorporation of new unmodified histones into chromatin. Here, we investigated the possible relationship between the propagation of epigenetic information and the developmental cell proliferation during <i>Xenopus</i> embryogenesis. We systemically inhibited cell proliferation during the G1/S transition in gastrula embryos and followed their development until the tadpole stage. Comparing wild-type and cell cycle–arrested embryos, we show that the inhibition of cell proliferation is principally compatible with embryo survival and cellular differentiation. In parallel, we quantified by mass spectrometry the abundance of a large set of histone modification states, which reflects the developmental maturation of the embryonic epigenome. The arrested embryos developed abnormal stage-specific histone modification profiles (HMPs), in which transcriptionally repressive histone marks were overrepresented. Embryos released from the cell cycle block during neurulation reverted toward normality on morphological, molecular, and epigenetic levels. These results suggest that the cell cycle block by HUA alters stage-specific HMPs. We propose that this influence is strong enough to control developmental decisions, specifically in cell populations that switch between resting and proliferating states such as stem cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RhoA- and Cdc42-induced antagonistic forces underlie symmetry breaking and spindle rotation in mouse oocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benoit Dehapiot, Raphaël Clément, Bourdais Anne, Virginie Carrière, Huet Sébastien, Halet Guillaume</p>

Mammalian oocyte meiotic divisions are highly asymmetric and produce a large haploid gamete and 2 small polar bodies. This relies on the ability of the cell to break symmetry and position its spindle close to the cortex before anaphase occurs. In metaphase II–arrested mouse oocytes, the spindle is actively maintained close and parallel to the cortex, until fertilization triggers sister chromatid segregation and the rotation of the spindle. The latter must indeed reorient perpendicular to the cortex to enable cytokinesis ring closure at the base of the polar body. However, the mechanisms underlying symmetry breaking and spindle rotation have remained elusive. In this study, we show that spindle rotation results from 2 antagonistic forces. First, an inward contraction of the cytokinesis furrow dependent on RhoA signaling, and second, an outward attraction exerted on both sets of chromatids by a Ran/Cdc42-dependent polarization of the actomyosin cortex. By combining live segmentation and tracking with numerical modeling, we demonstrate that this configuration becomes unstable as the ingression progresses. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies that neither the rotation direction nor the set of chromatids that eventually gets discarded are biologically predetermined.

Antiviral defenses can sense viral RNAs and mediate their destruction. This presents a challenge for host cells since they must destroy viral RNAs while sparing the host mRNAs that encode antiviral effectors. Here, we show that highly upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode antiviral proteins, have distinctive nucleotide compositions. We propose that self-targeting by antiviral effectors has selected for ISG transcripts that occupy a less self-targeted sequence space. Following interferon (IFN) stimulation, the CpG-targeting antiviral effector zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) reduces the mRNA abundance of multiple host transcripts, providing a mechanistic explanation for the repression of many (but not all) interferon-repressed genes (IRGs). Notably, IRGs tend to be relatively CpG rich. In contrast, highly upregulated ISGs tend to be strongly CpG suppressed. Thus, ZAP is an example of an effector that has not only selected compositional biases in viral genomes but also appears to have notably shaped the composition of host transcripts in the vertebrate interferome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">High-throughput characterization of photocrosslinker-bearing ion channel variants to map residues critical for function and pharmacology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina Braun, Søren Friis, Christian Ihling, Andrea Sinz, Jacob Andersen, Stephan A. Pless</p>

Incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) can endow proteins with novel functionalities, such as crosslinking or fluorescence. In ion channels, the function of these variants can be studied with great precision using standard electrophysiology, but this approach is typically labor intensive and low throughput. Here, we establish a high-throughput protocol to conduct functional and pharmacological investigations of ncAA-containing human acid-sensing ion channel 1a (hASIC1a) variants in transiently transfected mammalian cells. We introduce 3 different photocrosslinking ncAAs into 103 positions and assess the function of the resulting 309 variants with automated patch clamp (APC). We demonstrate that the approach is efficient and versatile, as it is amenable to assessing even complex pharmacological modulation by peptides. The data show that the acidic pocket is a major determinant for current decay, and live-cell crosslinking provides insight into the hASIC1a–psalmotoxin 1 (PcTx1) interaction. Further, we provide evidence that the protocol can be applied to other ion channels, such as P2X2 and GluA2 receptors. We therefore anticipate the approach to enable future APC-based studies of ncAA-containing ion channels in mammalian cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Language statistical learning responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joan Orpella, Ernest Mas-Herrero, Pablo Ripollés, Josep Marco-Pallarés, Ruth de Diego-Balaguer</p>

Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to extract regularities from the environment. In the domain of language, this ability is fundamental in the learning of words and structural rules. In lack of reliable online measures, statistical word and rule learning have been primarily investigated using offline (post-familiarization) tests, which gives limited insights into the dynamics of SL and its neural basis. Here, we capitalize on a novel task that tracks the <i>online</i> SL of simple syntactic structures combined with computational modeling to show that online SL responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in striatal function. Specifically, we demonstrate—on 2 different cohorts—that a temporal difference model, which relies on prediction errors, accounts for participants’ online learning behavior. We then show that the trial-by-trial development of predictions through learning strongly correlates with activity in both ventral and dorsal striatum. Our results thus provide a detailed mechanistic account of language-related SL and an explanation for the oft-cited implication of the striatum in SL tasks. This work, therefore, bridges the long-standing gap between language learning and reinforcement learning phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Data fusion based lane departure warning framework using fuzzy logic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lane detection is a difficult issue because of different lane circumstances. It plays an important part in advanced driver assistance systems, which give information about the centre of a host vehicle such as lane structure and lane position. Lane departure warning (LDW) is used to warn the driver about an unplanned lane exit from the original lane. The objective of this study was to develop a data-fusion LDW framework to improve the rate of detection of lane departure during daylight and at night. Methods: Vision-based LDW is a comprehensive framework based on vision-based lane detection with additional lateral offset ratio computations based on the detected X12 and X22 coordinates. The computed lateral offset ratio is used to detect lane departure based on predefined LDW identification criteria for vision-based LDW. Data fusion-based LDW was developed using a multi-input-single-output fuzzy logic controller. Data fusion involved lateral offset ratio and yaw acceleration response from the vision-based LDW and model-based vehicle dynamics frameworks. Real-life datasets were generated for simulation under the MATLAB Simulink platform. Results: Experimental results showed that fusion-based LDW achieved an average lane departure detection rate of 99.96% and 98.95% with false positive rates (FPR) of 0.04% and 1.05% using road footage clips #5–#27 in daytime and night-time, respectively. The average FPR using data fusion-based LDW reduced by 18.83% and 15.22% compared to vision-based LDW in daytime and night-time, respectively. Conclusions: The data fusion-based LDW is a novel way of reducing false lane departure detection by fusing two types of modalities to determine the correct lane departure information. The limitation is the constant warning threshold value used in the current implementation of LDW in the vision-based LDW framework. An adaptive mechanism of warning threshold taking various road structures into account could be developed to improve lane departure detection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular characterization and genetic diversity of four undescribed novel oleaginous Mortierella alpina strains from Libya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A large number of undiscovered fungal species still exist on earth, which can be useful for bioprospecting, particularly for single cell oil (SCO) production. Mortierella is one of the significant genera in this field and contains about hundred species. Moreover, M. alpina is the main single cell oil producer at commercial scale under this genus. Methods: Soil samples from four unique locations of North-East Libya were collected for the isolation of oleaginous Mortierella alpina strains by a serial dilution method. Morphological identification was carried out using light microscopy (Olympus, Japan) and genetic diversity of the isolated Mortierella alpina strains was assessed using conserved internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequences available on the NCBI GenBank database for the confirmation of novelty. The nucleotide sequences reported in this study have been deposited at GenBank (accession no. MZ298831:MZ298835). The MultAlin program was used to align the sequences of closely related strains. The DNA sequences were analyzed for phylogenetic relationships by molecular evolutionary genetic analysis using MEGA X software consisting of Clustal_X v.2.1 for multiple sequence alignment. The neighbour-joining tree was constructed using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model. Results: The present research study confirms four oleaginous fungal isolates from Libyan soil. These isolates (barcoded as MSU-101, MSU-201, MSU-401 and MSU-501) were discovered and reported for the first time from diverse soil samples of district Aljabal Al-Akhdar in North-East Libya and fall in the class: Zygomycetes; order: Mortierellales. Conclusions: Four oleaginous fungal isolates barcoded as MSU-101, MSU-201, MSU-401 and MSU-501 were identified and confirmed by morphological and molecular analysis. These fungal isolates showed highest similarity with Mortierella alpina species and can be potentialistic single cell oil producers. Thus, the present research study provides insight to the unseen fungal diversity and contributes to more comprehensive Mortierella alpina reference collections worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and characterization of a heavy metal- and antibiotic-tolerant novel bacterial strain from a contaminated culture plate of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green micro-alga. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green micro-alga, is normally cultured in laboratories in Tris-Acetate Phosphate (TAP), a medium which contains acetate as the sole carbon source. Acetate in TAP can lead to occasional bacterial and fungal contamination. We isolated a yellow-pigmented bacterium from a Chlamydomonas TAP plate. It was named Clip185 based on the Chlamydomonas strain plate it was isolated from. In this article we present our work on the isolation, taxonomic identification and physiological and biochemical characterizations of Clip185. Methods: We measured sensitivities of Clip185 to five antibiotics and performed standard microbiological tests to characterize it. We partially sequenced the 16S rRNA gene of Clip185. We identified the yellow pigment of Clip185 by spectrophotometric analyses. We tested tolerance of Clip185 to six heavy metals by monitoring its growth on Lysogeny Broth (LB) media plates containing 0.5 mM -10 mM concentrations of six different heavy metals. Results: Clip185 is an aerobic, gram-positive rod, oxidase-negative, mesophilic, alpha-hemolytic bacterium. It can ferment glucose, sucrose and mannitol. It is starch hydrolysis-positive. It is very sensitive to vancomycin but resistant to penicillin and other bacterial cell membrane- and protein synthesis-disrupting antibiotics. Clip185 produces a C50 carotenoid, decaprenoxanthin, which is a powerful anti-oxidant with a commercial demand. Decaprenoxanthin production is induced in Clip185 under light. NCBI-BLAST analyses of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of Clip185 revealed a 99% sequence identity to that of Microbacterium binotii strain PK1-12M and Microbacterium sp. strain MDP6. Clip185 is able to tolerate toxic concentrations of six heavy metals. Conclusions: Our results show that Clip185 belongs to the genus Microbacterium. In the future, whole genome sequencing of Clip185 will clarify if Clip185 is a new Microbacterium species or a novel strain of Microbacterium binotii, and will reveal its genes involved in antibiotic-resistance, heavy-metal tolerance and regulation of decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis.

                Bruxism is increasingly common in today's stressful world and affects mainly young patients. It is a combined disease that involves dentition and its supporting structures, muscles, ligaments and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here we present a complete combined analog and digital clinical protocol in a patient with parafunction. A young patient sought help due to impaired aesthetics, as a result of abraded tooth surfaces and severe symptoms of TMJ. We implemented a therapeutic protocol of six stages: deprogramming of the muscles and determination of treatment position and digital optimization; realization of the morphological plan for the upper dentition; non-invasive repositioning of the lower jaw by splint therapy; splint placement and follow-up; morphological planning of the lower dentition and replacement of the splint with fixed prosthesis with follow-up; and completion of the case with ceramic restorations. The digitally modeled temporary constructions for the upper jaw were made of PMMA and placed in the patient's mouth together with the splint on the lower jaw, made of Ceramill Splintec. After an adaptation period, all restorations were replaced by permanent zirconia. We achieved restoration of the defects of the dental arches and hard dental tissues and recovery to normal height of the lower third of the face (vertical dimension occlusion), fixed a stable and balanced position of the lower jaw, and repaired the normal physiological position of the TMJ for the patient. Аfter a multi-stage treatment we received a result satisfying the patient, the dentist and the dental technician. Aesthetics and function were restored, and clinical symptoms were removed from the TMJ.

                Although memory-like PD-1+ Tcf1+ CD8+ T cells (TMLs) sustain the immune response to chronic viral infection, the fate of these cells in the absence of persistent stimulation has remained unclear. Charmoy et al. find that TMLs can yield functional memory that retains a permanent imprint of prior chronic stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of cytokine production capacity in ancient and modern European populations</a></h4>

              
                As our ancestors migrated throughout different continents, natural selection increased the presence of alleles advantageous in the new environments. Heritable variations that alter the susceptibility to diseases vary with the historical period, the virulence of the infections, and their geographical spread. In this study we built polygenic scores for heritable traits that influence the genetic adaptation in the production of cytokines and immune-mediated disorders, including infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, and applied them to the genomes of several ancient European populations. We observed that the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point for immune-mediated traits in Europeans, favoring those alleles linked with the development of tolerance against intracellular pathogens and promoting inflammatory responses against extracellular microbes. These evolutionary patterns are also associated with an increased presence of traits related to inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution of strategy in bacterial warfare via the regulation of bacteriocins and antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria inhibit and kill one another with a diverse array of compounds, including bacteriocins and antibiotics. These attacks are highly regulated, but we lack a clear understanding of the evolutionary logic underlying this regulation. Here, we combine a detailed dynamic model of bacterial competition with evolutionary game theory to study the rules of bacterial warfare. We model a large range of possible combat strategies based upon the molecular biology of bacterial regulatory networks. Our model predicts that regulated strategies, which use quorum sensing or stress responses to regulate toxin production, will readily evolve as they outcompete constitutive toxin production. Amongst regulated strategies, we show that a particularly successful strategy is to upregulate toxin production in response to an incoming competitor’s toxin, which can be achieved via stress responses that detect cell damage (competition sensing). Mirroring classical game theory, our work suggests a fundamental advantage to reciprocation. However, in contrast to classical results, we argue that reciprocation in bacteria serves not to promote peaceful outcomes but to enable efficient and effective attacks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancient role of sulfakinin/cholecystokinin-type signalling in inhibitory regulation of feeding processes revealed in an echinoderm</a></h4>

              
                Sulfakinin (SK)/cholecystokinin (CCK)-type neuropeptides regulate feeding and digestion in protostomes (e.g. insects) and chordates. Here, we characterised SK/CCK-type signalling for the first time in a non-chordate deuterostome – the starfish <i>Asterias rubens</i> (phylum Echinodermata). In this species, two neuropeptides (ArSK/CCK1, ArSK/CCK2) derived from the precursor protein ArSK/CCKP act as ligands for an SK/CCK-type receptor (ArSK/CCKR) and these peptides/proteins are expressed in the nervous system, digestive system, tube feet, and body wall. Furthermore, ArSK/CCK1 and ArSK/CCK2 cause dose-dependent contraction of cardiac stomach, tube foot, and apical muscle preparations in vitro, and injection of these neuropeptides in vivo triggers cardiac stomach retraction and inhibition of the onset of feeding in <i>A. rubens</i>. Thus, an evolutionarily ancient role of SK/CCK-type neuropeptides as inhibitory regulators of feeding-related processes in the Bilateria has been conserved in the unusual and unique context of the extra-oral feeding behaviour and pentaradial body plan of an echinoderm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Separable neural signatures of confidence during perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual confidence is an evaluation of the validity of perceptual decisions. While there is behavioural evidence that confidence evaluation differs from perceptual decision-making, disentangling these two processes remains a challenge at the neural level. Here, we examined the electrical brain activity of human participants in a protracted perceptual decision-making task where observers tend to commit to perceptual decisions early whilst continuing to monitor sensory evidence for evaluating confidence. Premature decision commitments were revealed by patterns of spectral power overlying motor cortex, followed by an attenuation of the neural representation of perceptual decision evidence. A distinct neural representation was associated with the computation of confidence, with sources localised in the superior parietal and orbitofrontal cortices. In agreement with a dissociation between perception and confidence, these neural resources were recruited even after observers committed to their perceptual decisions, and thus delineate an integral neural circuit for evaluating perceptual decision confidence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">β-hydroxybutyrate accumulates in the rat heart during low-flow ischaemia with implications for functional recovery</a></h4>

              
                Extrahepatic tissues which oxidise ketone bodies also have the capacity to accumulate them under particular conditions. We hypothesised that acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) accumulation and altered redox status during low-flow ischaemia would support ketone body production in the heart. Combining a Langendorff heart model of low-flow ischaemia/reperfusion with liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we show that β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) accumulated in the ischaemic heart to 23.9 nmol/gww and was secreted into the coronary effluent. Sodium oxamate, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor, increased ischaemic β-OHB levels 5.3-fold and slowed contractile recovery. Inhibition of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) with hymeglusin lowered ischaemic β-OHB accumulation by 40%, despite increased flux through succinyl-CoA-3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT), resulting in greater contractile recovery. Hymeglusin also protected cardiac mitochondrial respiratory capacity during ischaemia/reperfusion. In conclusion, net ketone generation occurs in the heart under conditions of low-flow ischaemia. The process is driven by flux through both HMGCS2 and SCOT, and impacts on cardiac functional recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural variability and concerted motions of the T cell receptor - CD3 complex</a></h4>

              
                We investigate the structural and orientational variability of the membrane-embedded T cell receptor (TCR) - CD3 complex in extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations based on the recent cryo-EM structure determined by <i>Dong et al. (2019)</i>. We find that the TCR extracellular (EC) domain is highly variable in its orientation by attaining tilt angles relative to the membrane normal that range from 15° to 55°. The tilt angle of the TCR EC domain is both coupled to a rotation of the domain and to characteristic changes throughout the TCR - CD3 complex, in particular in the EC interactions of the C_ FG loop of the TCR, as well as in the orientation of transmembrane helices. The concerted motions of the membrane-embedded TCR - CD3 complex revealed in our simulations provide atomistic insights on conformational changes of the complex in response to tilt-inducing forces on antigen-bound TCRs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cooperative binding of TDP-43 to GU-rich RNA repeats antagonizes TDP-43 aggregation</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that forms neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in two major neurodegenerative diseases, ALS and FTLD. While the self-assembly of TDP-43 by its structured N-terminal and intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains has been widely studied, the mechanism by which mRNA preserves TDP-43 solubility in the nucleus has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that tandem RNA Recognition Motifs of TDP-43 bind to long GU-repeats in a cooperative manner through intermolecular interactions. Moreover, using mutants whose cooperativity is impaired, we found that the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA may be critical to maintain the solubility of TDP-43 in the nucleus and the miscibility of TDP-43 in cytoplasmic stress granules. We anticipate that the knowledge of a higher order assembly of TDP-43 on mRNA may clarify its role in intron processing and provide a means of interfering with the cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity-dependent regulation of mitochondrial motility in developing cortical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Developing neurons form synapses at a high rate. Synaptic transmission is very energy-demanding and likely requires ATP production by mitochondria nearby. Mitochondria might be targeted to active synapses in young dendrites, but whether such motility regulation mechanisms exist is unclear. We investigated the relationship between mitochondrial motility and neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of young mice in vivo and in slice cultures. During the first 2 postnatal weeks, mitochondrial motility decreases while the frequency of neuronal activity increases. Global calcium transients do not affect mitochondrial motility. However, individual synaptic transmission events precede local mitochondrial arrest. Pharmacological stimulation of synaptic vesicle release, but not focal glutamate application alone, stops mitochondria, suggesting that an unidentified factor co-released with glutamate is required for mitochondrial arrest. A computational model of synaptic transmission-mediated mitochondrial arrest shows that the developmental increase in synapse number and transmission frequency can contribute substantially to the age-dependent decrease of mitochondrial motility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A universal pocket in Fatty acyl-AMP ligases ensures redirection of fatty acid pool away from Coenzyme A-based activation</a></h4>

              
                Fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) channelize fatty acids towards biosynthesis of virulent lipids in mycobacteria and other pharmaceutically or ecologically important polyketides and lipopeptides in other microbes. They do so by bypassing the ubiquitous coenzyme A-dependent activation and rely on the acyl carrier protein-tethered 4'-phosphopantetheine (<i>holo</i>-ACP). The molecular basis of how FAALs strictly reject chemically identical and abundant acceptors like coenzyme A (CoA) and accept <i>holo</i>-ACP unlike other members of the ANL superfamily remains elusive. We show FAALs have plugged the promiscuous canonical CoA-binding pockets and utilize highly selective alternative binding sites. These alternative pockets can distinguish adenosine 3', 5'-bisphosphate-containing CoA from <i>holo</i>-ACP and thus FAALs can distinguish between CoA and <i>holo</i>-ACP. These exclusive features helped identify the omnipresence of FAAL-like proteins and their emergence in plants, fungi, and animals with unconventional domain organisations. The universal distribution of FAALs suggests they are parallelly evolved with FACLs for ensuring a CoA-independent activation and redirection of fatty acids towards lipidic metabolites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ACLY ubiquitination by CUL3-KLHL25 induces the reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism to facilitate iTreg differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells play a central role in immune suppression. As iTreg cells are differentiated from activated T (Th0) cells, cell metabolism undergoes dramatic changes, including a shift from fatty acid synthesis (FAS) to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Although the reprogramming in fatty acid metabolism is critical, the mechanism regulating this process during iTreg differentiation is still unclear. Here we have revealed that the enzymatic activity of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) declined significantly during iTreg differentiation upon transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) stimulation. This reduction was due to CUL3-KLHL25-mediated ACLY ubiquitination and degradation. As a consequence, malonyl-CoA, a metabolic intermediate in FAS that is capable of inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), was decreased. Therefore, ACLY ubiquitination and degradation facilitate FAO and thereby iTreg differentiation. Together, we suggest TGFβ1-CUL3-KLHL25-ACLY axis as an important means regulating iTreg differentiation and bring insights into the maintenance of immune homeostasis for the prevention of immune diseases.

                Comparing sequential stimuli is crucial for guiding complex behaviors. To understand mechanisms underlying sequential decisions, we compared neuronal responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the lateral intraparietal (LIP), and medial intraparietal (MIP) areas in monkeys trained to decide whether sequentially presented stimuli were from matching (M) or nonmatching (NM) categories. We found that PFC leads M/NM decisions, whereas LIP and MIP appear more involved in stimulus evaluation and motor planning, respectively. Compared to LIP, PFC showed greater nonlinear integration of currently visible and remembered stimuli, which correlated with the monkeys’ M/NM decisions. Furthermore, multi-module recurrent networks trained on the same task exhibited key features of PFC and LIP encoding, including nonlinear integration in the PFC-like module, which was causally involved in the networks’ decisions. Network analysis found that nonlinear units have stronger and more widespread connections with input, output, and within-area units, indicating putative circuit-level mechanisms for sequential decisions.

                With growing populations and pressing environmental problems, future economies will be increasingly plant-based. Now is the time to reimagine plant science as a critical component of fundamental science, agriculture, environmental stewardship, energy, technology and healthcare. This effort requires a conceptual and technological framework to identify and map all cell types, and to comprehensively annotate the localization and organization of molecules at cellular and tissue levels. This framework, called the Plant Cell Atlas (PCA), will be critical for understanding and engineering plant development, physiology and environmental responses. A workshop was convened to discuss the purpose and utility of such an initiative, resulting in a roadmap that acknowledges the current knowledge gaps and technical challenges, and underscores how the PCA initiative can help to overcome them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A simple regulatory architecture allows learning the statistical structure of a changing environment</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria live in environments that are continuously fluctuating and changing. Exploiting any predictability of such fluctuations can lead to an increased fitness. On longer timescales, bacteria can ‘learn’ the structure of these fluctuations through evolution. However, on shorter timescales, inferring the statistics of the environment and acting upon this information would need to be accomplished by physiological mechanisms. Here, we use a model of metabolism to show that a simple generalization of a common regulatory motif (end-product inhibition) is sufficient both for learning continuous-valued features of the statistical structure of the environment and for translating this information into predictive behavior; moreover, it accomplishes these tasks near-optimally. We discuss plausible genetic circuits that could instantiate the mechanism we describe, including one similar to the architecture of two-component signaling, and argue that the key ingredients required for such predictive behavior are readily accessible to bacteria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binding affinity landscapes constrain the evolution of broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Over the past two decades, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that confer protection against diverse influenza strains have been isolated. Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher-order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gut bacterial aggregates as living gels</a></h4>

              
                The spatial organization of gut microbiota influences both microbial abundances and host-microbe interactions, but the underlying rules relating bacterial dynamics to large-scale structure remain unclear. To this end we studied experimentally and theoretically the formation of three-dimensional bacterial clusters, a key parameter controlling susceptibility to intestinal transport and access to the epithelium. Inspired by models of structure formation in soft materials, we sought to understand how the distribution of gut bacterial cluster sizes emerges from bacterial-scale kinetics. Analyzing imaging-derived data on cluster sizes for eight different bacterial strains in the larval zebrafish gut, we find a common family of size distributions that decay approximately as power laws with exponents close to -2, becoming shallower for large clusters in a strain-dependent manner. We show that this type of distribution arises naturally from a Yule-Simons-type process in which bacteria grow within clusters and can escape from them, coupled to an aggregation process that tends to condense the system toward a single massive cluster, reminiscent of gel formation. Together, these results point to the existence of general, biophysical principles governing the spatial organization of the gut microbiome that may be useful for inferring fast-timescale dynamics that are experimentally inaccessible.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endothelial Pannexin 1-TRPV4 channel signaling lowers pulmonary arterial pressure in mice</a></h4>

              
                Pannexin 1 (Panx1), an ATP-efflux pathway, has been linked with inflammation in pulmonary capillaries. However, the physiological roles of endothelial Panx1 in the pulmonary vasculature are unknown. Endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels lower pulmonary artery (PA) contractility and exogenous ATP activates of endothelial TRPV4 channels. We hypothesized that endothelial Panx1-ATP-TRPV4 channel signaling promotes vasodilation and lowers pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). Endothelial, but not smooth muscle, knockout of Panx1 increased PA contractility and raised PAP in mice. Flow/shear stress increased ATP efflux through endothelial Panx1 in PAs. Panx1-effluxed extracellular ATP signaled through purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) to activate protein kinase Ca (PKCa), which in turn activated endothelial TRPV4 channels. Finally, caveolin-1 provided a signaling scaffold for endothelial Panx1, P2Y2R, PKCa, and TRPV4 channels in PAs, promoting their spatial proximity and enabling signaling interactions. These results indicate that endothelial Panx1-P2Y2R-TRPV4 channel signaling, facilitated by caveolin-1, reduces PA contractility and lowers PAP in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different encoding of reward location in dorsal and ventral hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal neurons encode a cognitive map for spatial navigation. When they fire at specific locations in the environment, they are known as place cells. In the dorsal hippocampus place cells accumulate at current navigational goals, such as learned reward locations. In the intermediate-to-ventral hippocampus (here collectively referred to as ventral hippocampus), neurons fire across larger place fields and regulate reward-seeking behavior, but little is known about their involvement in reward-directed navigation. Here, we compared the encoding of learned reward locations in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus during spatial navigation. We used calcium imaging with a head-mounted microscope to track the activity of CA1 cells over multiple days during which mice learned different reward locations. In dorsal CA1 (dCA1), the overall number of active place cells increased in anticipation of reward but the recruited cells changed with the reward location. In ventral CA1 (vCA1), the activity of the same cells anticipated the reward locations. Our results support a model in which the dCA1 cognitive map incorporates a changing population of cells to encode reward proximity through increased population activity, while the vCA1 provides a reward-predictive code in the activity of a specific subpopulation of cells. Both of these location-invariant codes persisted over time, and together they provide a dual hippocampal reward-location code, assisting goal-directed navigation.

                A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to uncover the principles governing how the brain interacts with the external environment. However, assumptions about external stimuli fundamentally constrain current computational models. We show in silico that unknown external stimulation can produce error in the estimated linear time-invariant dynamical system. To address these limitations, we propose an approach to retrieve the external (unknown) input parameters and demonstrate that the estimated system parameters during external input quiescence uncover spatiotemporal profiles of external inputs over external stimulation periods more accurately. Finally, we unveil the expected (and unexpected) sensory and task-related extra-cortical input profiles using functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 96 subjects (Human Connectome Project) during the resting-state and task scans. Together, we provide evidence that this embodied brain activity model offers information about the structure and dimensionality of the BOLD signals external drivers and shines light on likely external sources contributing to the BOLD signals non-stationarity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurophysiological evidence for cognitive map formation during sequence learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans deftly parse statistics from sequences. Some theories posit that humans learn these statistics by forming emph{cognitive maps}, or underlying representations of the latent space which links items in the sequence. Here, an item in the sequence is a node, and the probability of transitioning between two items is an edge. Sequences can then be generated from walks through the latent space, with different spaces giving rise to different sequence statistics. Individual or group differences in sequence learning can be modeled by changing the time scale over which estimates of transition probabilities are built, or in other words, by changing the amount of temporal discounting. Latent space models with temporal discounting bear a resemblance to models of navigation through Euclidean spaces. However, few explicit links have been made between predictions from Euclidean spatial navigation and neural activity during human sequence learning. Here, we use a combination of behavioral modeling and intracranial encephalography (iEEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity might support the formation of space-like cognitive maps through temporal discounting during sequence learning. Specifically, we acquire human reaction times from a sequential reaction time task, to which we fit a model that formulates the amount of temporal discounting as a single free parameter. From the parameter, we calculate each individual's estimate of the latent space. We find that neural activity reflects these estimates mostly in the temporal lobe, including areas involved in spatial navigation. Similar to spatial navigation, we find that low dimensional representations of neural activity allow for easy separation of important features, such as modules, in the latent space. Lastly, we take advantage of the high temporal resolution of iEEG data to determine the time scale on which latent spaces are learned. We find that learning typically happens within the first 500 trials, and is modulated by the underlying latent space and the amount of temporal discounting characteristic of each participant. Ultimately, this work provides important links between behavioral models of sequence learning and neural activity during the same behavior, and contextualizes these results within a broader framework of domain general cognitive maps.

                The evolution of human cognitive function is reliant on complex social interactions which form the behavioural foundation of who we are. These social capacities are subject to dramatic change in disease and injury; yet their supporting neural substrates remain poorly understood. Hyperscanning employs functional neuroimaging to simultaneously assess brain activity in two individuals and offers the best means to understand the neural basis of social interaction. However, present technologies are limited, either by poor performance (low spatial/temporal precision) or unnatural scanning environment (claustrophobic scanners, with interactions via video). Here, we solve this problem by developing a new form of hyperscanning using wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG). This approach exploits quantum sensors for MEG signal detection, in combination with high-fidelity magnetic field control - afforded by a novel "matrix coil" system - to enable simultaneous scanning of two freely moving participants. We demonstrate our approach in a somatosensory task and an interactive ball game. Despite large and unpredictable subject motion, sensorimotor brain activity was delineated clearly in space and time, and correlation of the envelope of neuronal oscillations between people was demonstrated. In sum, unlike existing modalities, wearable-MEG combines high fidelity data acquisition and a naturalistic setting, which will facilitate a new generation of hyperscanning.

                As a social species, ready exchange with peers is a pivotal asset - our 'social capital'. Yet, single-person households have come to pervade metropolitan cities worldwide, with unknown consequences in the long run. Here, we systematically explore the morphological manifestations associated with singular living in ~40,000 UK Biobank participants. The uncovered population-level signature spotlights the highly associative default mode network, in addition to findings such as in the amygdala central, cortical and corticoamygdaloid nuclei groups, as well as the hippocampal fimbria and dentate gyrus. Sex-stratified analyses revealed male-specific neural substrates, including somatomotor, saliency and visual systems, while female-specific neural substrates centred on the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. In line with our demographic profiling results, the discovered neural imprint of living alone is potentially linked to alcohol and tobacco consumption, anxiety, sleep quality as well as daily TV watching. The secular trend for solitary living will require new answers from public-health decision makers.

                Human behaviour across the life span is driven by the psychological need to belong, from kindergarten to bingo nights. Being part of social groups constitutes a backbone for communal life, and confers many benefits for physical and mental health. Capitalizing on neuroimaging and behavioural data from ~40.000 participants from the UK Biobank population cohort, we used structural and functional analyses to explore how social participation is reflected in the human brain. Across three different types of social groups, structural analyses point towards variance in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex as structural substrates tightly linked to social participation. Functional connectivity analyses emphasized the importance of default mode and limbic network, but also showed differences for sports teams and religious groups as compared to social clubs. Taken together, our findings establish the structural and functional integrity of the default mode network as a neural signature of social belonging.

                The frequency-following response (FFR) is a scalp-recorded electrophysiological potential that closely follows the periodicity of complex sounds such as speech. It has been suggested that FFRs reflect the linear superposition of responses that are triggered by the glottal pulse in each cycle of the fundamental frequency (F0 responses) and sequentially propagate through auditory processing stages in brainstem, midbrain, and cortex. However, this conceptualization of the FFR is debated, and it remains unclear if and how well a simple linear superposition can capture the spectro-temporal complexity of FFRs that are generated within the highly recurrent and non-linear auditory system. To address this question, we used a deconvolution approach to compute the hypothetical F0 responses that best explain the FFRs in rhesus monkeys to human speech and click trains with time-varying pitch patterns. The linear superposition of F0 responses explained well over 90% of the variance of click train steady state FFRs and well over 80% of mandarin tone steady state FFRs. The F0 responses could be measured with high signal-to-noise ratio and featured several spectro-temporally and topographically distinct components that likely reflect the activation of brainstem (<5ms; 200-1000 Hz), midbrain (5-15 ms; 100-250 Hz) and cortex (15-35 ms; ~90 Hz). In summary, our results in the monkey support the notion that FFRs arise as the superposition of F0 responses by showing for the first time that they can capture the bulk of the variance and spectro-temporal complexity of FFRs to human speech with time-varying pitch. These findings identify F0 responses as a potential diagnostic tool that may be useful to reliably link altered FFRs in speech and language disorders to altered F0 responses and thus to specific latencies, frequency bands and ultimately processing stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A New Perspective on Individual Reliability beyond Group Effects for Event-related Potentials: A Multisensory Investigation and Computational Modeling</a></h4>

              
                The dominant approach in investigating the individual reliability for event-related potentials (ERPs) is to extract peak-related features at electrodes showing the strongest group effects. Such a peak-based approach implicitly assumes ERP components showing a stronger group effect are also more reliable, but this assumption has not been substantially validated and few studies have investigated the reliability of ERPs beyond peaks. In this study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs did not guarantee a higher reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs with a computational model, we found that the consistency between group-level ERP responses and individual reliability was modulated by inter-subject latency jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings suggest that the conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the individual reliability in ERPs. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of ERP measurements should be considered in individual-level neurophysiological trait evaluation and psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Greater neural pattern dissimilarity in retrieval stage of spaced learning is associated with higher meaningfulness and better memory</a></h4>

              
                Spaced learning research aims to find the best learning interval to improve people's learning efficiency. Although it has been studied for many years, people do not know the physiological mechanism behind it clearly. Some neural representation studies have found that under the condition of spaced learning, the representation similarity of two encoding increases, and believe that this conflicts with the classical encoding variability theory. In this experiment, we used a new experimental paradigm and a longer lag to let the Chinese university students to learn English-Chinese word pairs, and we introduced the idea of meaningful learning into the learning stage to improve the traditional keyword method experiment task. Finally, by comparing the difference (spaced learning - one-time learning) vs. difference (massed learning - one-time learning) in the final test (retrieval) stage, we get different results: there is no significant difference in ERP, At the same time, the neural spatial pattern dissimilarity (STPDS) had significant results in the parietal lobe of 400ms and the right frontal lobe of 600ms. However, we believe that there is no direct contradiction between the two experimental evidence. On the contrary, they reflect different aspects of the process of spaced learning. Based on the evidence of different neural representation evidence of encoding and retrieval, this paper presents an idea of reintegrating three classical theories, eliminates the opposition between encoding variability and defective processing, and summarizes and classifies the experimental paradigm of spaced learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic and functional connectivity provide unique and complementary insights into cognition-connectome relationships</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in current cognitive neuroscience is how functional brain connectivity gives rise to human cognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) describes brain connectivity based on cerebral oxygenation dynamics (hemodynamic connectivity), whereas [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography (FDG-fPET) describes brain connectivity based on cerebral glucose uptake (metabolic connectivity), each providing a unique characterisation of the human brain. How these two modalities differ in their contribution to cognition and behaviour is unclear. We used simultaneous resting-state FDG-fPET/fMRI to investigate how hemodynamic connectivity and metabolic connectivity relate to cognitive function by applying partial least squares analyses. Results revealed that while for both modalities the frontoparietal anatomical subdivisions related the strongest to cognition, using hemodynamic measures this network expressed executive functioning, episodic memory, and depression, while for metabolic measures this network exclusively expressed executive functioning. These findings demonstrate the unique advantages that simultaneous FDG-PET/fMRI has to provide a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms that underpin cognition and highlights the importance of multimodality imaging in cognitive neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Myelin speeds cortical oscillations by consolidating phasic parvalbumin-mediated inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons are critically involved in producing rapid network oscillations and cortical microcircuit computations but the significance of PV+ axon myelination to the temporal features of inhibition remains elusive. Here using toxic and genetic models of demyelination and dysmyelination, respectively, we find that loss of compact myelin reduces PV+ interneuron presynaptic terminals, increases failures and the weak phasic inhibition of pyramidal neurons abolishes optogenetically driven gamma oscillations in vivo. Strikingly, during periods of quiet wakefulness selectively theta rhythms are amplified and accompanied by highly synchronized interictal epileptic discharges. In support of a causal role of impaired PV-mediated inhibition, optogenetic activation of myelin-deficient PV+ interneurons attenuated the power of slow theta rhythms and limited interictal spike occurrence. Thus, myelination of PV+ axons is required to consolidate fast inhibition of pyramidal neurons and enable behavioral state-dependent modulation of local circuit synchronization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assembly formation is stabilized by Parvalbumin neurons and accelerated by Somatostatin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Learning entails preserving the features of the external world in the neuronal representations of the brain and manifests itself in the form of strengthened interactions between neurons within assemblies. Hebbian synaptic plasticity is thought to be one mechanism by which correlations in spiking promote assembly formation during learning. While spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules for excitatory synapses have been well characterized, inhibitory STDP rules remain incomplete, particularly with respect to sub-classes of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we report that in layer 2/3 of the orbitofrontal cortex of mice, inhibition from parvalbumin (PV) interneurons onto excitatory (E) neurons follows a symmetric STDP function and mediates homeostasis in E-neuron firing rates. However, inhibition from somatostatin (SOM) interneurons follows an asymmetric, Hebbian STDP rule. We incorporate these findings in both large-scale simulations and mean-field models to investigate how these differences in plasticity impact network dynamics and assembly formation. We find that the plasticity of SOM inhibition builds lateral inhibitory connections and increases competition between assemblies. This is reflected in amplified correlations between neurons within assembly and anti-correlations between assemblies. An additional finding is that the emergence of tuned PV inhibition depends on the interaction between SOM and PV STDP rules. Altogether, we show that incorporation of differential inhibitory STDP rules promotes assembly formation through competition, while enhanced inhibition both within and between assemblies protects new representations from degradation after the training input is removed.

                Epidemiological studies reveal that air pollution exposure may exacerbate neurodegeneration. Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are pollutants that remain unregulated in ambient air by environmental agencies. Due to their small size (<100nm), UFPs have the most potential to cross the bodily barriers and thus impact the brain. However, little information exists about how UFPs affect brain function. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which has been linked to air pollutant exposure, yet limited information is available on the mechanistic connection between them. This study aims to decipher the effects of UFPs in the brain and periphery using the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. In our study design, AD mice and their wildtype littermates were subjected to 2-weeks inhalation exposure of UFPs in a whole-body chamber. That subacute exposure did not affect the blood-brain barrier integrity or amyloid-beta accumulation. However, when multiple cytokines were analyzed, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain and periphery, with a predominant alteration of interferon-gamma in response to UFP exposure in both genotypes. Following exposure, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase was significantly upregulated only in the 5xFAD hippocampi, depicting oxidative stress induction in the exposed AD mouse group. These data demonstrate that short-term exposure to inhaled UFPs induces inflammation without affecting amyloid-beta load. This study provides a better understanding of adverse effects caused by short-term UFP exposure in the brain and periphery, also in the context of AD.

                Electricity is widely utilized as environmental stimulus to sense the world by many animal species. Despite its importance, however, molecular and physiological mechanisms for responding to electrical stimulus have been far less understood compared to other sensory stimuli. Here we report novel behavioral responses to electrical stimulus of the nematode C. elegans. When the animals on food are stimulated by alternating current, their movement speed suddenly increases more than 2-fold, which persists for a few minutes even after the electrical stimulation is terminated. Genetic analyses reveal that voltage-gated channels are required for the response, possibly as the sensors, and neuropeptide signaling suppresses the persistent response. Additional behavioral analysis reveals that, in addition to the persistence, the animal's response to electrical shock is scalable and has a negative valence, which are recently regarded as emotion primitives, suggesting that the response may reflect a primitive form of "fear" of animals.

	<p>Studies have reported difficulties in decision making for patients with schizophrenia or depression. Here, we investigated whether there are differences between schizophrenia patients, depressed patients, and healthy individuals (HC) when decisions are to be made under risk and cognitive flexibility is required. We were also interested in the relationships between decision making, cognitive functioning, and disease severity. Thirty HC, 28 schizophrenia patients, and 28 depressed patients underwent structured clinical assessments and were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale or Hamilton Rating Scale. They performed the Probability-Associated Gambling (PAG) Task and a neuropsychological test battery. Both patient groups obtained lower scores than HC in memory and executive function measures. In the PAG task, relative to HC, depressed patients made slower decisions but showed a comparable number of advantageous decisions or strategy flexibility. Schizophrenia patients were slower, riskier, and less flexible compared to HC. For them, the decision making behavior correlated with the symptom severity. In both groups, decision making scores correlated with memory and executive function scores. Patients with schizophrenia or depression may have difficulties under risk when quick and flexible decisions are required. These difficulties may be more pronounced in patients who have marked cognitive deficits or severe clinical symptoms.</p>

<p>Using CaMKIIαCre and floxed-HIF-2α mice, we generated mice with specific deletion of HIF-2α gene in the forebrain neurons. We showed that neuronal deficiency of HIF-2α increased cell death and brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cellular responses to hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are governed largely by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. Our previous studies show that HIF-1α induction is an important factor that mediates protective effects in the brain after neonatal HI. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of another closely related HIF α isoform, HIF-2α, specifically the neuronal HIF-2α, to brain HI injury. Homozygous transgenic mice with a floxed exon 2 of HIF-2α were bred with CaMKIIα-Cre mice to generate a mouse line with selective deletion of HIF-2α in forebrain neurons. These mice, along with their wildtype littermates, were subjected to HI at postnatal day 9. Brain injury at different ages was evaluated by the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and spectrin breakdown products at 24 hr; and histologically at 6 days or 3 months after HI. Multiple behavioral tests were performed at 3 months, prior to sacrifice. Loss of neuronal HIF-2α exacerbated brain injury during the acute (24 hr) and subacute phases (6 days), with a trend toward more severe volume loss in the adult brain. The long-term brain function for coordinated movement and recognition memory, however, were not impacted in the neuronal HIF-2α deficient mice. Our data suggest that, similar to HIF-1α, neuronal HIF-2α promotes cell survival in the immature mouse brain. The two HIF alpha isoforms may act through partially overlapping or distinct transcriptional targets to mediate their intrinsic protective responses against neonatal HI brain injury.</p>

                Possession of a firearm without a certified valid license is against Nepalese law. After the civil war, the government issued a stringent rule of not allowing the public to keep firearms without a valid reason, despite having a license. However, there are still people who keep firearms in their homes. The present case reports the accidental death of a teenage boy who used a musket for hunting a wild animal. The present case highlights the fact that despite the stringent law, illegal possession of arms for trophy hunting is still prevalent in rural Nepal. Furthermore, this study aims to highlight the importance of paramedics in early intervention, stabilization and transport of the sick and injured to the hospital in emergency situations. Recruitment of paramedics in the ambulance service might prevent untimely death in many patients while being transported to the hospital which was lacking in the present case.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ethics issues identified by applicants and ethics experts in Horizon 2020 grant proposals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We assessed the ethics review of proposals selected for funding under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and the European Research Council (ERC) in Horizon 2020, EU’s framework programme for research and innovation, 2014-2020. Methods: We analysed anonymized datasets for 3,054 MSCA individual fellowships (IF), 417 MSCA Innovative Training Networks (ITN), and 1,465 ERC main-listed proposals with ethics conditional clearance, over four years (2016 to 2019). The datasets included the information on ethics issues identified by applicants in their proposal and ethics issues and requirements identified by ethics experts during the ethics review. Results: 42% of proposals received ethical clearance. For proposals with conditional ethics clearance (n=3546), most of the identified ethics issues by both applicants and ethics experts were in the ethics categories related to humans; protection of personal data; environment, health and safety; and non-EU countries. Ethics experts identified twice as many ethics issues compared to applicants across funding schemes, years, and from high- and low-research performing countries. ERC grants had the highest number of ethics requirements per proposal (median (Md)=8, interquartile range (IQR=4-14), compared to ITN (Md=6, IQR=3-13) and IF grants (Md=3, IQR=2-6). The majority of requirements had to be fulfilled after grant agreement: 99.4% for IF, 99.5% for ITN, and 26.0% for ERC. For 9% of the proposals, the requirements included the appointment of an independent ethics advisor and 1% of the proposals had to appoint an ethics advisory board. Conclusions: Many applicants for highly competitive H2020 funding schemes lack awareness of ethics issues raised by their proposed research. There is a need for better training of researchers at all career stages about ethics issues in research, more support to researchers from research organizations to follow the funding agencies requirements, as well as further development and harmonization of the ethics appraisal process during grant assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bridging skill gaps and creating future ready accounting and finance graduates: an exploratory study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Changing trends in the use of technology have become an impelling force to be reckoned with for the accounting and finance profession. The curriculum offered in higher learning institutions must be quickly revamped so that students who complete a bachelor’s degree are digitally competent upon graduation. With US$55.3 billion invested in FinTech in 2019 alone and more than 72% of accounting jobs being automated, graduates must be trained on digital skills to be future proof. Accounting and finance graduates must be made competent in skills that are related to digital content such as blockchain technology, information assets and autonomous peer to peer systems, to name a few. Methods: We used a three-phase approach: 1) careful mapping of digital topics taught within the course structure offered at these institutions; 2) review of current best practices and digital learning tools for digital inclusion which was ascertained from literature; and 3) 80 experts in a think tank group were interviewed on antecedents, awareness and problems in relation to digital inclusion within the curriculum to validate our research objective. Results: Eleven key tools for inclusion in the curriculum were discussed with experts and then mapped to current curriculum offered at institutions. We discovered that less than 5% of these were being taught. In total, 78% of experts agreed that digital content is inevitable, 90% agreed that digital inclusion based on tools that were discussed will yield great benefits for students, and lastly 75% agreed that giving digital exposure to students must be standard practice. Conclusions: The response from experts confirms that digital inclusion is imperative, but instructors themselves lacked the know-how of emerging technologies. Only the curriculum of institutions with approved bachelor’s programs were included in this research. In our future work we hope to include all institutions and professional bodies as well.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Discrimination of the SARS–CoV-2 strains using of coloured s-LASCA-imaging of GB-speckles, developed for the gene “S” nucleotide sequences [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attrition of methylnaltrexone treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with chronic noncancer pain and opioid-induced constipation: a post hoc pooled analysis of two clinical trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Opioids prescribed for the management of chronic noncancer pain are associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist, has demonstrated robust efficacy and was well-tolerated in treating opioid-induced constipation without affecting central analgesia. Our objective was to assess changes in the frequency of adverse events after the first or second dose of methylnaltrexone or placebo. Methods: This post hoc analysis pooled data from two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials assessing methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation in the outpatient setting. Patients received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (12 mg once daily or 12 mg once every other day), oral methylnaltrexone (150, 300, or 450 mg daily), or placebo. Adverse events, opioid withdrawal symptoms, pain intensity, and rescue-free bowel movements (RFBMs) within 4 hours of the first dose (i.e., RFBM responders) were assessed. Associations between adverse event frequencies and RFBM response were also evaluated. Results: The analysis included 1263 adult patients with chronic noncancer pain. Treatment-emergent adverse event rates declined from treatment day 1 to 2 (methylnaltrexone: 16.2%–5.3%; placebo: 6.6%−5.4%). Among methylnaltrexone-treated patients, significantly greater proportions of RFBM responders versus nonresponders reported gastrointestinal adverse events on day 1. No associations between RFBM response and the frequency of adverse events were observed in the placebo group. No meaningful changes in opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain intensity were observed. Conclusions: Early-onset adverse events following methylnaltrexone treatment, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, are at least partially due to laxation. Methylnaltrexone treatment effectively relieves opioid-induced constipation without affecting the central analgesic effects of opioids.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vasoactive agents in acute mesenteric ischaemia in critical care.  A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a surgical emergency which has an associated high mortality.  The mainstay of active treatment includes early surgical intervention, with resection of non-viable bowel, and revascularisation of the ischaemic bowel where possible. Due to the physiological insult of AMI however, perioperative care often involves critical care and the use of vasoactive agents to optimise end organ perfusion. A number of these vasoactive agents are currently available with varied mechanism of action and effects on splanchnic blood flow. However, specific guidance on which is the optimal vasoactive drug to use in these settings is limited. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current evidence comparing vasoactive drugs in AMI. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review was performed on the 5th of November 2020 to identify randomised clinical trials comparing different vasoactive agents in AMI on outcomes including mortality. The search was performed through the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) search support library. Results were analysed using the Rayyan platform, and independently screened by four investigators. Results: 614 distinct papers were identified. After screening, there were no randomised clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: This review identifies a gap in literature, and therefore recommends an investigation into current practice and clinician preference in relation to vasoactive agents in AMI. Multicentre randomised controlled trials comparing these medications on clinical outcomes will therefore be required to address this question.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endocannabinoid system has been extensively studied in recent decades, particularly the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, due to their important role in neuroinflammation. Among these, CB2 has gained prominence due to its selective overexpression in glial cells during neuroinflammation. In contrast to CB1 agonists, CB2 agonists have no side effects such as ataxia, hypothermia, euphoria, psychological, or addiction liabilities. CB2 and its selective agonists' above-mentioned unique properties have become a research focus in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The review discusses the neuroprotective role of CB receptors, particularly CB2, in AD, as well as the significance and limitations of this research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of airborne transmission: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February to 20 December 2020 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 67 primary studies and 22 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 67 primary studies, 53 (79%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 12 (18%) report cycle threshold values and 18 (127%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational and of low quality. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 36 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 42 studies conducted in-hospital that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 24 (57%) reported positive results for SARs-CoV-2 (142 positives out of 1,403 samples: average 10.1%, range 0% to 100%). There was no pattern between the type of hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU) and RT-PCR positivity. Seventeen studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community, of which seven performed RT-PCR sampling, and two studies reported weak positive RNA samples for 2 or more genes (5 of 125 samples positive: average 4.0%). Ten studies attempted viral culture with no serial passage. Conclusion:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 prevents firm conclusions from being drawn about airborne transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1: Role in placenta accreta spectrum disorder [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta  is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1  (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim  to see if  sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods: This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group)  at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia.  Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum  Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses  were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05  considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results: Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated  with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion: sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

                Aims: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from 2000-2020 in various parts of Nepal. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched using the appropriate keywords. All Nepalese studies mentioning the prevalence of T2DM and/or details such as risk factors were included. Studies were screened using Covidence. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software v.3. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of T2DM, pre-diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance in Nepal in the last two decades was 10% (CI, 7.1%- 13.9%), 19.4% (CI, 11.2%- 31.3%), and 11.0% (CI, 4.3%- 25.4%) respectively. The prevalence of T2DM in the year 2010-15 was 7.75% (CI, 3.67-15.61), and it increased to 11.24% between 2015-2020 (CI, 7.89-15.77). There were 2.19 times higher odds of having T2DM if the body mass index was ≥24.9 kg/m2. Analysis showed normal waist circumference, normal blood pressure, and no history of T2DM in a family has 64.1%, 62.1%, and 67.3% lower odds of having T2DM, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of T2DM, pre-diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance in Nepal was estimated to be 10%, 19.4%, and 11% respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Playing Edcraft at Home: Gamified Online Learning for Recycling Intention during Lockdown [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recycling is a way to sustain ecosystems. There are substantial studies on recycling intention due to the continual growth of unethical and unsustainable waste disposal. Creative approaches to recycling awareness activities should be made to fulfil youths’ increasing interest in and demand for recycling. The main objective of this study is to explore the factors related to youths’ recycling intentions after experiencing a gamified online recycling learning activity, Edcraft Gamified Learning (EGL). Gamified recycling education is believed to be a practical and engaging approach for youths. Methods: 100 students participated in EGL, consisting of two levels of plastic crafting and recycling activities. They experienced online EGL at home between May and September in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic total lockdown in Malaysia, namely, Movement Control Order (MCO). 29 participants were selected to participate in five focus group discussions (FGDs) with five to eight participants per session to explore their opinions towards gamified learning, motivation and recycling intention. Results: This paper reports the findings of the FGDs. A codebook was developed based on the codes from the FGD feedback. The codes were rated by two raters, followed by an assessment of inter-rater reliability and thematic analysis. The findings emerged and were confirmed with four themes as factors that influence recycling intention. They are gameful experience, social influence, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Conclusion: The dependent variable, recycling intention, was connected to the four themes to verify the conceptual framework. One limitation of the study was the design of the EGL activity, which was only carried out over two days with two levels of gamified recycling education, as students had concurrent academic online classes during that period.

However, little is known about microglia-vascular interactions. In a recent paper published in Nature Communications, Bisht et al. identify a signalling mechanism that attracts and maintains microglia at the capillary wall. Moreover, they show that microglia regulate capillary vascular tone, playing a more significant role in blood flow regulation than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor planning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Actions often require the selection of a specific goal amongst a range of possibilities, like when a softball player must precisely position her glove to field a fast-approaching ground ball. Previous studies have suggested that during goal uncertainty the brain prepares for all potential goals in parallel and averages the corresponding motor plans to command an intermediate movement that is progressively refined as additional information becomes available. Although intermediate movements are widely observed, they could instead reflect a neural decision about the single best action choice given the uncertainty present. Here we systematically dissociate these possibilities using novel experimental manipulations and find that when confronted with uncertainty, humans generate a motor plan that optimizes task performance rather than averaging potential motor plans. In addition to accurate predictions of population-averaged changes in motor output, a novel computational model based on this performance-optimization theory accounted for a majority of the variance in individual differences between participants. Our findings resolve a long-standing question about how the brain selects an action to execute during goal uncertainty, providing fundamental insight into motor planning in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrated evaluation of telomerase activation and telomere maintenance across cancer cell lines</a></h4>

              
                In cancer, telomere maintenance is critical for the development of replicative immortality. Using genome sequences from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project, we calculated telomere content across 1,299 cancer cell lines. We find that telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>) expression correlates with telomere content in lung, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening data, we show that lower telomeric content is associated with dependency of CST telomere maintenance genes. Increased dependencies of shelterin members are associated with wild-type <i>TP53</i> status. Investigating the epigenetic regulation of <i>TERT</i>, we find widespread allele-specific expression in promoter-wildtype contexts. <i>TERT</i> promoter-mutant cell lines exhibit hypomethylation at PRC2-repressed regions, suggesting a cooperative global epigenetic state in the reactivation of telomerase. By incorporating telomere content with genomic features across comprehensively characterized cell lines, we provide further insights into the role of telomere regulation in cancer immortality.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modelling the impact of decidual senescence on embryo implantation in human endometrial assembloids</a></h4>

              
                Decidual remodelling of midluteal endometrium leads to a short implantation window after which the uterine mucosa either breaks down or is transformed into a robust matrix that accommodates the placenta throughout pregnancy. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we established and characterised endometrial assembloids, consisting of gland-like organoids and primary stromal cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that decidualized assembloids closely resemble midluteal endometrium, harbouring differentiated and senescent subpopulations in both glands and stroma. We show that acute senescence in glandular epithelium drives secretion of multiple canonical implantation factors, whereas in the stroma it calibrates the emergence of anti-inflammatory decidual cells and pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells. Pharmacological inhibition of stress responses in pre-decidual cells accelerated decidualization by eliminating the emergence of senescent decidual cells. In co-culture experiments, accelerated decidualization resulted in entrapment of collapsed human blastocysts in a robust, static decidual matrix. By contrast, the presence of senescent decidual cells created a dynamic implantation environment, enabling embryo expansion and attachment, although their persistence led to gradual disintegration of assembloids. Our findings suggest that decidual senescence controls endometrial fate decisions at implantation and highlight how endometrial assembloids may accelerate the discovery of new treatments to prevent reproductive failure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and dynamics of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 bound to a PARylated nucleosome</a></h4>

              
                The chromatin remodeler ALC1 is recruited to and activated by DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains deposited by PARP1/PARP2/HPF1 upon detection of DNA lesions. ALC1 has emerged as a candidate drug target for cancer therapy as its loss confers synthetic lethality in homologous recombination-deficient cells. However, structure-based drug design and molecular analysis of ALC1 have been hindered by the requirement for PARylation and the highly heterogeneous nature of this post-translational modification. Here, we reconstituted an ALC1 and PARylated nucleosome complex modified <i>in vitro</i> using PARP2 and HPF1. This complex was amenable to cryo-EM structure determination without cross-linking, which enabled visualization of several intermediate states of ALC1 from the recognition of the PARylated nucleosome to the tight binding and activation of the remodeler. Functional biochemical assays with PARylated nucleosomes highlight the importance of nucleosomal epitopes for productive remodeling and reveal that ALC1 preferentially slides nucleosomes away from DNA breaks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Information content differentiates enhancers from silencers in mouse photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Enhancers and silencers often depend on the same transcription factors (TFs) and are conflated in genomic assays of TF binding or chromatin state. To identify sequence features that distinguish enhancers and silencers, we assayed massively parallel reporter libraries of genomic sequences targeted by the photoreceptor TF CRX in mouse retinas. Both enhancers and silencers contain more TF motifs than inactive sequences, but relative to silencers, enhancers contain motifs from a more diverse collection of TFs. We developed a measure of information content that describes the number and diversity of motifs in a sequence and found that, while both enhancers and silencers depend on CRX motifs, enhancers have higher information content. The ability of information content to distinguish enhancers and silencers targeted by the same TF illustrates how motif context determines the activity of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences.
