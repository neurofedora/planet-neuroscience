              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq revealed transit-amplifying thymic epithelial cells expressing autoimmune regulator</a></h4>

              
                Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are critical for self-tolerance induction in T cells via promiscuous expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which are controlled by the transcriptional regulator, AIRE. Whereas AIRE-expressing (Aire<sup>+</sup>) mTECs undergo constant turnover in the adult thymus, mechanisms underlying differentiation of postnatal mTECs remain to be discovered. Integrative analysis of single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) suggested the presence of proliferating mTECs with a specific chromatin structure, which express high levels of Aire and co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 (Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup>). Proliferating Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs detected using Fucci technology express a minimal number of Aire-dependent TSAs and are converted into quiescent Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs expressing high levels of TSAs after a transit amplification. These data provide evidence for the existence of transit-amplifying Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC precursors during the Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC differentiation process of the postnatal thymus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-rapid eye movement sleep and wake neurophysiology in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Motivated by the potential of objective neurophysiological markers to index thalamocortical function in patients with severe psychiatric illnesses, we comprehensively characterized key non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parameters across multiple domains, their interdependencies, and their relationship to waking event-related potentials and symptom severity. In 72 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 58 controls, we confirmed a marked reduction in sleep spindle density in SCZ and extended these findings to show that fast and slow spindle properties were largely uncorrelated. We also describe a novel measure of slow oscillation and spindle interaction that was attenuated in SCZ. The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, statistically predicted disease status in the replication cohort. Although also altered in patients, auditory event-related potentials elicited during wake were unrelated to NREM metrics. Consistent with a growing literature implicating thalamocortical dysfunction in SCZ, our characterization identifies independent NREM and wake EEG biomarkers that may index distinct aspects of SCZ pathophysiology and point to multiple neural mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating these neurophysiological markers, individually or in combination, to guide efforts at treatment and prevention as well as identifying individuals most likely to benefit from specific interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparative multi-tissue profiling reveals extensive tissue-specificity in transcriptome reprogramming during thermal adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Thermal adaptation is an extensively used intervention for enhancing or suppressing thermogenic and mitochondrial activity in adipose tissues. As such, it has been suggested as a potential lifestyle intervention for body weight maintenance. While the metabolic consequences of thermal acclimation are not limited to the adipose tissues, the impact on the rest of the tissues in context of their gene expression profile remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the effects in a comparative multi-tissue RNA sequencing approach following exposure of mice to 10 °C, 22 °C, or 34 °C in a panel of organs consisting of spleen, bone marrow, spinal cord, brain, hypothalamus, ileum, liver, quadriceps, subcutaneous-, visceral- and brown adipose tissues. We highlight that transcriptional responses to temperature alterations exhibit a high degree of tissue-specificity both at the gene level and at GO enrichment gene sets, and show that the tissue-specificity is not directed by the distinct basic gene expression pattern exhibited by the various organs. Our study places the adaptation of individual tissues to different temperatures in a whole-organism framework and provides integrative transcriptional analysis necessary for understanding the temperature-mediated biological programming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmentally determined intersectional genetic strategies to dissect adult somatosensory circuit function</a></h4>

              
                Improvements in the speed and cost of expression profiling of neuronal tissues offer an unprecedented opportunity to define ever finer subgroups of neurons for functional studies. In the spinal cord, single cell RNA sequencing studies support decades of work on spinal cord lineage studies offering a unique opportunity to probe adult function based on developmental lineage. While Cre/Flp recombinase intersectional strategies remain a powerful tool to manipulate spinal cord neurons, the field lacks genetic tools and strategies to restrict manipulations to the adult mouse spinal cord at the speed at which new tools develop. This study establishes a new workflow for intersectional mouse-viral strategies to dissect adult spinal cord circuit function based on developmental genetic lineage. To restrict manipulations to the spinal cord, we generate a brain-sparing Hoxb8FlpO mouse line restricting Flp-recombinase expression to caudal tissue. Recapitulating endogenous Hoxb8 gene expression, Flp-dependent reporter expression is present in the caudal embryo starting day 10.5. This expression restricts FlpO activity in the adult to the caudal brainstem and below. Hoxb8FlpO heterozygous and homozygous mice do not develop any of the sensory or locomotor phenotypes evident in Hoxb8 heterozygous or mutant animals, suggesting normal developmental function of the Hoxb8 gene and protein in Hoxb8FlpO mice. Comparing the variability of brain recombination to available caudal Cre and Flp lines we show that Hoxb8FlpO activity is not present in the brain above the caudal brainstem, independent of mouse genetic background. Lastly, we combine the Hoxb8FlpO mouse line with a dorsal horn developmental lineage Cre mouse line to express GFP in developmentally determined dorsal horn populations. Using GFP dependent Cre recombinase viruses, we target this lineage in the adult to show how this strategy can incorporate viral tools in a modular fashion. In summary, this new mouse line and viral approach provides a blueprint to dissect adult somatosensory circuit function using Cre/Flp genetic tools to target spinal cord interneurons based on genetic lineage.

                Doublets are prevalent in single-cell sequencing data and can lead to artifactual findings. A number of strategies have therefore been proposed to detect them. Building on the strengths of existing approaches, we developed scDblFinder, a fast, flexible and accurate Bioconductor-based doublet detection method. Here we present the method, justify its design choices, demonstrate its performance on both single-cell RNA and accessibility (ATAC) sequencing data, and provide some observations on doublet formation, detection, and enrichment analysis. Even in complex datasets, scDblFinder can accurately identify most heterotypic doublets, and was already found by an independent benchmark to outcompete alternatives.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Marine plant mediated green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using mangrove Rhizophora stylosa: Effect of variable process and their antibacterial activity [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most natural plants used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are limited to marine plants. To carry out applications, colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNps) should have appropriate properties such as homogeneous shapes, small and narrow particle size distribution, and long time stability. This study aims to determine the effects of a variable process of AgNps mediated mangrove Rhizophora stylosa (RS) leaf extract, and antibacterial activity.  Methods: Synthesis of AgNps was carried out by stirring silver nitrate solution with aqueous extract. The characterization of AgNps was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) zetasizer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Evaluation of antibacterial activity was carried out on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Reaction conditions such as the concentration of metal ions (0.001 M, 0.005 M, and 0.01 M), extracts (1%, 3%, and 5% v/v), and the reaction time on the size and stability of nanoparticles were also explored. Results: The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption of colloidal AgNps in a wavelength range of 403–443 nm.  TEM analysis showed that as-synthesized AgNps were spherical in shape with a size range of 5–87 nm. The use of 0.001 M and 0.005 M of Ag+ resulted in a smaller diameter than the synthesized AgNps, using 0.01 M Ag+, in the same extract concentration. The range of zeta potential was -24.9 mV to -27.7 mV. The as-synthesized AgNps were stable for more than one month. The XRD analysis showed four peaks, which were attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. The results of the silver nanoparticles synthesis showed good activity on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone between 4.1–7.2 mm. Conclusions: The AgNps synthesized with RS leaf extract, which is a reducing agent, showed good potential as an antibacterial component.

                In October 2021, 59 scientists from 14 countries and 13 U.S. states collaborated virtually in the Third Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNANexus Structural Variation hackathon. The goal of the hackathon was to advance research on structural variants (SVs) by prototyping and iterating on open-source software. This led to nine hackathon projects focused on diverse genomics research interests, including various SV discovery and genotyping methods, SV sequence reconstruction, and clinically relevant structural variation, including SARS-CoV-2 variants. Repositories for the projects that participated in the hackathon are available at https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics.

                Background: The study’s purpose was to identify associations between mental health risk, suicide attempts, and family function.   Methods: A correlational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was carried out in a group of adolescents in the last grade of secondary school to establish the association between mental health risk, suicide attempt, and family functionality. The instruments used were the self-report questionnaire, the suicide risk assessment scale, and the family APGAR. Data analysis was performed using the artificial intelligence algorithm (gower clustering).  Results: 246 adolescents responded to the three instruments, which made it possible to select those with correlations of sensitive interest and, based on these, an intervention plan. Psychological distress was found in 28%, psychotic symptoms in 85%, and problematic alcohol use in 9%. Good family functioning was identified in 34% and some type of family dysfunction in 66%. In terms of suicide risk, there was a low suicide risk of 74%, 24% medium risk, and 2% high risk. It could be shown that there is a correlation in a group of 15% of the respondents.  Conclusions: The risk of suffering mental health deterioration and the suicide risk, during this pandemic period, seems to be related to family functionality.

The skin's primary function is to protect our body from external factors that can harm the body by forming a protective barrier that covers the body. This review aims to provide insights related to wound-healing mechanisms of several plants in HaCat cells. Methods: The literature study method used, both from primary and secondary libraries. The library search was conducted using online-based library search instruments from 2009 to 2021, such as NCBI-PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: The wound-healing mechanism includes processes that restore skin integrity through four stages: hemostasis, inflammation, multiplication, and remodeling. Many plants have been studied to have activity in wound-healing by various mechanisms. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential to research wound-healing mechanisms to find treatments sourced from natural compounds.

                Background: Several studies have shown that active compounds of Asclepias subulata (cardenolides) have antiproliferative effect on human cancer cells. Cardenolides isolated from A. subulata can be used as active chemical markers to elaborate phytopharmaceutical preparations. To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a standardized extract of the aerial parts, based on Asclepias subulata cardenolides. Methods: Four standardized extracts were prepared by HPLC-DAD depending on the concentration of calotropin and the antiproliferative activity was measured for the MTT assay, on the A549, MCF-7, HeLa, PC3 and ARPE cell lines. The concentrations of calotropin used for the standardization of the extracts were 10, 7.6, 5 and 1 mg/dL. Results: Standardization of the A. subulata extract based on calotropin at 7.6 mg/g dry weight was achieved and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated over A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, obtaining proliferation percentages of 3.8 to 13.4%. Conclusions: The standardized extracts of A. subulata at different concentrations of calotropin showed antiproliferative activity against all the cell lines evaluated. The greatest effect was observed against the HeLa cell line.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively in the inference of protein partners from sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andonis Gerardos, Nicola Dietler, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Inferring protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important task in computational biology. Recent methods based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) or Mutual Information (MI) allow to find interaction partners among paralogs of two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions, we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an important role of phylogeny.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Appropriate relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions minimizes the risk of a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 infections in spite of the Delta variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wadim Koslow, Martin J. Kühn, Sebastian Binder, Margrit Klitz, Daniel Abele, Achim Basermann, Michael Meyer-Hermann</p>

We analyze the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under an increasing number of vaccinations in Germany. For the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we employ a SIR-type model that accounts for age-dependence and includes realistic contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of NPIs occurs on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. We account for spatial heterogeneity and commuting activities in between regions in Germany, and the testing of commuters is considered as a further NPI. We include the ongoing vaccination process and analyze the effect of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, which is considered to be 40%–60% more infectious then the currently dominant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. We explore different opening scenarios under the ongoing vaccination process by assuming that local restrictions are either lifted in early July or August with or without continued wearing of masks and testing. Our results indicate that we can counteract the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 despite the Delta variant with appropriate timing for the relaxation of NPIs. In all cases, however, school children are hit the hardest.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Annotating functional effects of non-coding variants in neuropsychiatric cell types by deep transfer learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Boqiao Lai, Sheng Qian, Hanwei Zhang, Siwei Zhang, Alena Kozlova, Junbao Duan, Jinbo Xu, Xin He</p>

Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of loci associated with neuropsychiatric traits, however, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these loci remains difficult. To help prioritize causal variants and interpret their functions, computational methods have been developed to predict regulatory effects of non-coding variants. An emerging approach to variant annotation is deep learning models that predict regulatory functions from DNA sequences alone. While such models have been trained on large publicly available dataset such as ENCODE, neuropsychiatric trait-related cell types are under-represented in these datasets, thus there is an urgent need of better tools and resources to annotate variant functions in such cellular contexts. To fill this gap, we collected a large collection of neurodevelopment-related cell/tissue types, and trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet) using such data. Furthermore, our model, called MetaChrom, borrows information from public epigenomic consortium to improve the accuracy via transfer learning. We show that MetaChrom is substantially better in predicting experimentally determined chromatin accessibility variants than popular variant annotation tools such as CADD and delta-SVM. By combining GWAS data with MetaChrom predictions, we prioritized 31 SNPs for Schizophrenia, suggesting potential risk genes and the biological contexts where they act. In summary, MetaChrom provides functional annotations of any DNA variants in the neuro-development context and the general method of MetaChrom can also be extended to other disease-related cell or tissue types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicting knee adduction moment response to gait retraining with minimal clinical data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nataliya Rokhmanova, Katherine J. Kuchenbecker, Peter B. Shull, Reed Ferber, Eni Halilaj</p>

Knee osteoarthritis is a progressive disease mediated by high joint loads. Foot progression angle modifications that reduce the knee adduction moment (KAM), a surrogate of knee loading, have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating pain and improving function. Although changes to the foot progression angle are overall beneficial, KAM reductions are not consistent across patients. Moreover, customized interventions are time-consuming and require instrumentation not commonly available in the clinic. We present a regression model that uses minimal clinical data—a set of six features easily obtained in the clinic—to predict the extent of first peak KAM reduction after toe-in gait retraining. For such a model to generalize, the training data must be large and variable. Given the lack of large public datasets that contain different gaits for the same patient, we generated this dataset synthetically. Insights learned from a ground-truth dataset with both baseline and toe-in gait trials (N = 12) enabled the creation of a large (N = 138) synthetic dataset for training the predictive model. On a test set of data collected by a separate research group (N = 15), the first peak KAM reduction was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.134% body weight * height (%BW*HT). This error is smaller than the standard deviation of the first peak KAM during baseline walking averaged across test subjects (0.306%BW*HT). This work demonstrates the feasibility of training predictive models with synthetic data and provides clinicians with a new tool to predict the outcome of patient-specific gait retraining without requiring gait lab instrumentation.

Despite multiple spillover events and short chains of transmission on at least 4 continents, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has never triggered a pandemic. By contrast, its relative, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has, despite apparently little, if any, previous circulation in humans. Resolving the unsolved mystery of the failure of MERS-CoV to trigger a pandemic could help inform how we understand the pandemic potential of pathogens, and probing it underscores a need for a more holistic understanding of the ways in which viral genetic changes scale up to population-level transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The structural context of posttranslational modifications at a proteome-wide scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Isabell Bludau, Sander Willems, Wen-Feng Zeng, Maximilian T. Strauss, Fynn M. Hansen, Maria C. Tanzer, Ozge Karayel, Brenda A. Schulman, Matthias Mann</p>

The recent revolution in computational protein structure prediction provides folding models for entire proteomes, which can now be integrated with large-scale experimental data. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has identified and quantified tens of thousands of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), most of them of uncertain functional relevance. In this study, we determine the structural context of these PTMs and investigate how this information can be leveraged to pinpoint potential regulatory sites. Our analysis uncovers global patterns of PTM occurrence across folded and intrinsically disordered regions. We found that this information can help to distinguish regulatory PTMs from those marking improperly folded proteins. Interestingly, the human proteome contains thousands of proteins that have large folded domains linked by short, disordered regions that are strongly enriched in regulatory phosphosites. These include well-known kinase activation loops that induce protein conformational changes upon phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism appears to be widespread in kinases but also occurs in other protein families such as solute carriers. It is not limited to phosphorylation but includes ubiquitination and acetylation sites as well. Furthermore, we performed three-dimensional proximity analysis, which revealed examples of spatial coregulation of different PTM types and potential PTM crosstalk. To enable the community to build upon these first analyses, we provide tools for 3D visualization of proteomics data and PTMs as well as python libraries for data accession and processing.

                Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrinological problem among women in the reproductive age, is characterized by chronic ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and elevated luteinizing hormone: follicle stimulating hormone (LH-FSH) ratio. The goal of this study was to examine if the blood LH-FSH ratio and total testosterone (TT) levels in Sudanese women with PCOS were linked. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 300 women with confirmed PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria.  PCOS women mean (standard deviation): age 29.1(5.8) years; body mass index (BMI) 27.9±4.6 kg/m2. Each participant underwent a clinical history, physical examination, and ovaries ultrasonogram.  ASYS Expert Plus Microplate was used to quantify serum LH, FSH, and TT levels in fasting blood specimen drawn during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle of women with PCOS. Results: More than two-thirds of the participants (71.0%) had an aberrant LH-FSH ratio (cut-off>1.0), and 58.3% had hyperandrogenemia (TT>109.5 ng/dL). Hyperandrogenemic women had significantly increased LH-FSH ratio (P= 0.000). The LH-FSH ratio and serum TT were significantly positive correlated (r= 0.329, P= 0.000). Overall, 52.0% of women with PCOS exhibited menstrual cycle irregularity, and 59.0 % had a positive family history of PCOS. On logistic regression analysis, the LH-FSH ratio (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.308 (1.698- 3.139, P= 0.000) was found to be positively related to hyperandrogenemia independently. Furthermore, when the LH-FSH ratio is greater than one, hyperandrogenemia can be distinguished from normoandrogenemia, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.726, P= 0.000, 95% CI: (0.668-0.785) with a serum TT threshold of 109.5 ng/dL (sensitivity 70.0%, specificity 77.1%). Conclusions: In Sudanese women with PCOS, the serum LH-FSH ratio and TT have a strong relationship. Furthermore, LH-FSH ratio of greater than one can be used to distinguish between hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS women.

                Background: This review aims to map the evidence on the effectiveness of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications and identify research gaps in key outcomes and CAMs. Methods: We followed the Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines to undertake this scoping review. We carried out a comprehensive search from inception to March 2020 in electronic databases and registers. Forward and backward citations of included studies were also searched. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies with intervention and control arm were mapped based on the effectiveness of various CAM (Yoga, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Siddha, Naturopathy, Unani, and Sowa-rigpa) on outcomes among individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome, T2DM with and without any comorbidities. Results: A total of 249 studies were included after screening 3798 citations. Most of the included studies were conducted in India and Iran. Most frequently studied CAM interventions include Yoga, Ayurveda, and herbal products as compared to other CAM therapies. Conclusion: Although we identified a lot of literature on the effectiveness of CAMs for T2DM, there is a lack of standardization of preparation of these medicines and the interventional modalities. To validate the potential benefits of CAM, robust research with high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews are needed to bridge the gap of evidence in CAM therapies. Future investments for research in CAM may focus on assessing the quality of existing trials and finding out an optimal dose, frequency, and duration of CAM, both as an alternative and complementary approach.

                Background: Cancer is a comorbidity that leads to progressive worsening of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with increased mortality. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to yield evidence of adverse outcomes of Covid-19 in gynecologic cancer. Methods: Searches through PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and medRxiv to find articles on the outcome of gynecologic cancer with Covid-19 (24 July 2021–19 February 2022). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and random-effects model were presented. Results: We accepted 51 studies (a total of 1991 gynecologic cancer patients with Covid-19). Covid-19 infection cases were lower in gynecologic cancer vs hematologic cancer (OR 0.71, CI 0.56-0.90, p 0.005). Severe Covid-19 infection and death were lower in gynecologic cancer vs lung and hematologic cancer (OR 0.36, CI 0.16-0.80, p 0.01), (OR 0.52, CI 0.44-0.62, p <0.0001), (OR 0.26, CI 0.10-0.67 p 0.005), (OR 0.63, CI 0.47-0.83, p 0.001) respectively. Increased Covid death was seen in gynecologic cancer vs population with breast cancer, non-Covid cancer, and non-cancer Covid (OR 1.50, CI 1.20-1.88, p 0.0004), (OR 11.83, CI 8.20-17.07, p <0.0001), (OR 2.98, CI 2.23-3.98, p <0.0001) respectively.    Conclusion: Gynecologic cancer has higher Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to non-cancer, breast cancer, non-metastatic, and Covid-19 negative population. Gynecologic cancer has fewer Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to other cancer types, lung cancer, and hematologic cancer. These findings may aid health policies and services during the ongoing global pandemic. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42021256557 (22/05/21)

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development and feasibility testing of action observation training videos in acute stroke survivors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Action observation training (AOT) is used for lower limb (LL) stroke rehabilitation in subacute and chronic stages, but concise information regarding the types of activities to be used and the feasibility of administration in the acute stroke population is unknown. The aim of this study was to develop and validate videos of appropriate activities for LL AOT and test administrative feasibility in acute stroke.   Method: A video inventory of LL activities was created after a literature survey and expert scrutiny. Five stroke rehabilitation experts validated the videos per domains of relevance, comprehension, clarity, camera position and brightness. LL AOT was then tested on ten individuals with acute stroke for uncovering barriers for clinical use in a feasibility study. Participants watched the activities and attempted imitation of the same. Determination of administrative feasibility was undertaken via participant interviews.   Results: Suitable LL activities for stroke rehabilitation were identified. Content validation of videos led to improvements in selected activities and video quality. Expert scrutiny led to further video processing to include different perspectives of view and speeds of projected movements. Barriers identified included inability to imitate actions shown in videos and increased distractibility for some participants.    Conclusion: A video catalogue of LL activities was developed and validated. AOT was deemed safe and feasible for acute stroke rehabilitation and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of the paddy fields to support community and tourism activities in Ciemas District, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ciletuh Geopark Tourism Area (UNESCO Global Geopark Ciletuh Palabuhanratu) is now one of the main tourist attractions in the Sukabumi Regency, West Java province of Indonesia. The geopark area is in the Ciemas District. Based on the Regional Spatial Planning of the Sukabumi Regency, the Ciemas District is designated as the center of the agricultural sector activities for paddy rice plants in the Sukabumi District. Through the development of tourism activities, Ciletuh Palabuhanratu Geopark will undoubtedly threaten the rice farming sector in the area. In the disruption era, as technology changes, information and knowledge become more accessible. The development of these tourism activities will grow faster in Ciemas District, causing many changes, especially in physical space and regional economics. One change would be in the rice fields in this area, which has been transformed into built-in land in villas, inns, and homestays. If this is allowed, then the function of the sustainability of agricultural activities in the Ciemas District will be threatened. For this reason, control efforts are needed so that paddy fields that must be maintained do not change function quickly. This study analyzes the land use and land cover for paddy fields in Ciemas District. The method of this study is the quantitative method. The analytical methods include population projection, ArcGIS analysis, and Land Potential Index. The findings contribute to supporting the development of tourism while maintaining food security. The results indicate that there are protected areas from being prioritized, which are not prioritized for paddy fields, can be used for the development of tourism activities. Thus, this can be used as a source for the government to make policies for fulfilling food requirements and developing tourism activities in the region.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of protein complex partners as a compensatory mechanism in aneuploid tumors</a></h4>

              
                Aneuploidy, a state of chromosome imbalance, is a hallmark of human tumors, but its role in cancer still remains to be fully elucidated. To understand the consequences of whole-chromosome-level aneuploidies on the proteome, we integrated aneuploidy, transcriptomic and proteomic data from hundreds of TCGA/CPTAC tumor samples. We found a surprisingly large number of expression changes happened on other, non-aneuploid chromosomes. Moreover, we identified an association between those changes and co-complex members of proteins from aneuploid chromosomes. This co-abundance association is tightly regulated for aggregation-prone aneuploid proteins and those involved in a smaller number of complexes. On the other hand, we observe that complexes of the cellular core machinery are under functional selection to maintain their stoichiometric balance in aneuploid tumors. Ultimately, we provide evidence that those compensatory and functional maintenance mechanisms are established through post-translational control and that the degree of success of a tumor to deal with aneuploidy-induced stoichiometric imbalance impacts the activation of cellular protein degradation programs and patient survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stereospecific lasofoxifene derivatives reveal the interplay between estrogen receptor alpha stability and antagonistic activity in ESR1 mutant breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Chemical manipulation of estrogen receptor alpha ligand binding domain structural mobility tunes receptor lifetime and influences breast cancer therapeutic activities. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) extend ERα cellular lifetime/accumulation. They are antagonists in the breast but agonists in the uterine epithelium and/or in bone. Selective estrogen receptor degraders/downregulators (SERDs) reduce ERα cellular lifetime/accumulation and are pure antagonists. Activating somatic <i>ESR1</i> mutations Y537S and D538G enable resistance to first-line endocrine therapies. SERDs have shown significant activities in <i>ESR1</i> mutant setting while few SERMs have been studied. To understand whether chemical manipulation of ERα cellular lifetime and accumulation influences antagonistic activity, we studied a series of methylpyrollidine lasofoxifene derivatives that maintained the drug's antagonistic activities while uniquely tuning ERα cellular accumulation. These molecules were examined alongside a panel of antiestrogens in live cell assays of ERα cellular accumulation, lifetime, SUMOylation, and transcriptional antagonism. High-resolution x-ray crystal structures of WT and Y537S ERα ligand binding domain in complex with the methylated lasofoxifene derivatives or representative SERMs and SERDs show that molecules that favor a highly buried helix 12 antagonist conformation achieve the greatest transcriptional suppression activities in breast cancer cells harboring WT/Y537S <i>ESR1</i>. Together these results show that chemical reduction of ERα cellular lifetime is not necessarily the most crucial parameter for transcriptional antagonism in <i>ESR1</i> mutated breast cancer cells. Importantly, our studies show how small chemical differences within a scaffold series can provide compounds with similar antagonistic activities, but with greatly different effects of the cellular lifetime of the ERα, which is crucial for achieving desired SERM or SERD profiles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-PK promotes DNA end resection at DNA double strand breaks in G0 cells</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is confined to the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle partly due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G<sub>1</sub> phase and non-cycling quiescent (G<sub>0</sub>) cells where DSBs are predominately repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Unexpectedly, we uncovered extensive MRE11- and CtIP-dependent DNA end resection at DSBs in G<sub>0</sub> murine and human cells. A whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen revealed the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) complex as a key factor in promoting DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells. In agreement, depletion of FBXL12, which promotes ubiquitylation and removal of the KU70/KU80 subunits of DNA-PK from DSBs, promotes even more extensive resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells. In contrast, a requirement for DNA-PK in promoting DNA end resection in proliferating cells at the G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle was not observed. Our findings establish that DNA-PK uniquely promotes DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub>, but not in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase cells, which has important implications for DNA DSB repair in quiescent cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Machine learning sequence prioritization for cell type-specific enhancer design</a></h4>

              
                Recent discoveries of extreme cellular diversity in the brain warrant rapid development of technologies to access specific cell populations within heterogeneous tissue. Available approaches for engineering-targeted technologies for new neuron subtypes are low yield, involving intensive transgenic strain or virus screening. Here, we present Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL), an improved virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and then make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons. Nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild-type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV+ neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. The SNAIL framework also has high utility for multispecies cell probe engineering; expression from a mouse PV+ SNAIL enhancer sequence was enriched in PV+ neurons of the macaque cortex. Expansion of this technology has broad applications in cell type-specific observation, manipulation, and therapeutics across species and disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Palatal morphology predicts the paleobiology of early salamanders</a></h4>

              
                Ecological preferences and life history strategies have enormous impacts on the evolution and phenotypic diversity of salamanders, but the yet established reliable ecological indicators from bony skeletons hinder investigations into the paleobiology of early salamanders. Here we statistically demonstrate, by using time-calibrated cladograms and geometric morphometric analysis on 71 specimens in 36 species, that both the shape of the palate and many non-shape covariates particularly associated with vomerine teeth are ecologically informative in early stem- and basal crown-group salamanders. Disparity patterns within the morphospace of the palate in ecological preferences, life history strategies and taxonomic affiliations were analyzed in detail, and evolutionary rates and ancestral states of the palate were reconstructed. Our results show that the palate is heavily impacted by convergence constrained by feeding mechanisms and also exhibits clear stepwise evolutionary patterns with alternative phenotypic configurations to cope with similar functional demand. Salamanders are diversified ecologically before the Middle Jurassic and achieved all their present ecological preferences in the Early Cretaceous. Our results reveal that the last common ancestor of all salamanders shares with other modern amphibians a unified biphasic ecological preference, and metamorphosis is significant in the expansion of ecomorphospace of the palate in early salamanders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcription elongation is finely tuned by dozens of regulatory factors</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the complex network that regulates transcription elongation requires the quantitative analysis of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity in a wide variety of regulatory environments. We performed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in 41 strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> lacking known elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, chromatin modifiers, and remodelers. We found that the opposing effects of these factors balance transcription elongation and antisense transcription. Different sets of factors tightly regulate Pol II progression across gene bodies so that Pol II density peaks at key points of RNA processing. These regulators control where Pol II pauses with each obscuring large numbers of potential pause sites that are primarily determined by DNA sequence and shape. Antisense transcription varies highly across the regulatory landscapes analyzed, but antisense transcription in itself does not affect sense transcription at the same locus. Our findings collectively show that a diverse array of factors regulate transcription elongation by precisely balancing Pol II activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and their native interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila</i> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that represent a target for insecticides. Peptide neurotoxins are known to block nAChRs by binding to their target subunits, however, a better understanding of this mechanism is needed for effective insecticide design. To facilitate the analysis of nAChRs we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate null alleles for all ten <i>nAChR</i> subunit genes in a common genetic background. We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles, we determined the effects of α-Bungarotoxin (α-Btx) and ω-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm α-Btx interactions with the <i>Drosophila</i> α5 (D<i>α</i>5), Dα6, D<i>α</i>7 subunits. Finally, we report the localisation of fluorescent tagged endogenous Dα6 during <i>Drosophila</i> CNS development. Taken together, this study elucidates native <i>Drosophila</i> nAChR subunit interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins and provides a resource for the in vivo analysis of insect nAChRs.

                We describe a novel microscopy for studying the network of axons in the unlabeled fresh wholemount retina. The intrinsic radiation of second harmonic generation (SHG) was utilized to visualize single axons of all major retinal neurons, i.e., photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and the retinal ganglion cells. The cell types of SHG+ axons were determined using transgenic GFP/YFP mice. New findings were obtained with retinal SHG imaging: Muller cells do not maintain uniformly polarized microtubules in the processes; SHG+ axons of bipolar cells terminate in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) in a subtype-specific manner; a subset of amacrine cells, presumably the axon-bearing types, emits SHG; and the axon-like neurites of amacrine cells provide a cytoskeletal scaffolding for the IPL stratification. To demonstrate the utility, retinal SHG imaging was applied for testing whether the inner retina is preserved in glaucoma, using DBA/2 mice as a model of glaucoma and DBA/2-Gpnmb+ as the non-glaucomatous control. It was found that the morphology of the inner retina was largely intact in glaucoma and the pre-synaptic compartments to the retinal ganglion cells were uncompromised. It proves retinal SHG imaging as a promising technology for studying the physiological and diseased retina in 3D.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying rhythmicity in perceptual reports</a></h4>

              
                Several recent studies investigated the rhythmic nature of cognitive processes that lead to perception and behavioral report. These studies used different methods, and there has not yet been an agreement on a general standard. Here, we present a way to test and quantitatively compare these methods. We simulated behavioral data from a typical experiment and analyzed these data with several methods. We applied the main methods found in the literature, namely sine-wave fitting, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Least Square Spectrum (LSS). DFT and LSS can be applied both on the averaged accuracy time course and on single trials. LSS is mathematically equivalent to DFT in the case of regular, but not irregular sampling - which is more common. LSS additionally offers the possibility to take into account a weighting factor which affects the strength of the rhythm, such as arousal. Statistical inferences were done either on the investigated sample (fixed-effect) or on the population (random-effect) of simulated participants. Multiple comparisons across frequencies were corrected using False-Discovery-Rate, Bonferroni, or the Max-Based approach. To perform a quantitative comparison, we calculated Sensitivity, Specificity and D-prime of the investigated analysis methods and statistical approaches. Within the investigated parameter range, single-trial methods had higher sensitivity and D-prime than the methods based on the averaged-accuracy-time-course. This effect was further increased for a simulated rhythm of higher frequency. If an additional (observable) factor influenced detection performance, adding this factor as weight in the LSS further improved Sensitivity and D-prime. For multiple comparison correction, the Max-Based approach provided the highest Specificity and D-prime, closely followed by the Bonferroni approach. Given a fixed total amount of trials, the random-effect approach had higher D-prime when trials were distributed over a larger number of participants, even though this gave less trials per participant. Finally, we present the idea of using a dampened sinusoidal oscillator instead of a simple sinusoidal function, to further improve the fit to behavioral rhythmicity observed after a reset event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">From recency to the central tendency bias in working memory: a unifying attractor network model</a></h4>

              
                Contraction bias is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory is biased towards the average of past observations. This phenomenon has been first described more than a century ago and since then, has been replicated in various decision making tasks in humans, and rodents. Contraction bias is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain, given the noisy nature of working memory. From a Bayesian perspective, the progressive shift of the noisy memory towards the mean of a prior distribution built from past sensory experience helps with more accurate estimates of the memory. In this work, we propose an alternative account, via short-term history biases (serial dependence). Our model is motivated and inspired by recent results from an auditory delayed-discrimination task in rats, where the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been shown to be critical to these memory effects. The dynamics of our model suggests that contraction bias can emerge as a result of a volatile working memory content which makes it susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience. The errors, at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli, and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the distribution's mean. Our model explains both short-term history biases, as well as contraction bias towards the sensory mean for the averaged performance. The results are consistent with the role of the PPC in encoding such sensory history biases, and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas.

                Precise synaptic connection of neurons with their targets is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A plethora of signaling pathways act in concert to mediate the precise spatial arrangement of synaptic connections. Here we show a novel role for a gap junction protein in controlling tiled synaptic arrangement in the GABAergic motor neurons in C. elegans, in which their axons and synapses overlap minimally with their neighboring neurons within the same class. We found that while EGL-20/Wnt controls axonal tiling, their presynaptic tiling is mediated by a gap junction protein UNC-9/Innexin, that is localized at the presynaptic tiling border between neighboring DD neurons. Strikingly, the gap junction channel activity of UNC-9 is dispensable for its function in controlling tiled presynaptic patterning. While gap junctions are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system as channels, our finding uncovered the novel channel-independent role of UNC-9 in synapse patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The time course of categorical and perceptual similarity effects in visual search</a></h4>

              
                During visual search for objects (e.g., an apple), the surrounding distractor objects may share perceptual (tennis ball), categorical (banana), or both (peach) properties with the target. Previous studies showed that the perceptual similarity between target and distractor objects influences visual search. Here, we tested whether categorical target-distractor similarity also influences visual search, and how this influence depends on perceptual similarity. By orthogonally manipulating categorical and perceptual target-distractor similarity, we could investigate how and when the two similarities interactively affect search performance and neural correlates of spatial attention (N2pc) using electroencephalography (EEG). Behavioral results showed that categorical target-distractor similarity interacted with perceptual target-distractor similarity, such that the effect of categorical similarity was strongest when target and distractor objects were perceptually similar. EEG results showed that perceptual similarity influenced the early part of the N2pc (200-250 ms after stimulus onset), while categorical similarity influenced the later part (250-300 ms). Mirroring the behavioral results, categorical similarity interacted with perceptual similarity during this later time window, with categorical effects only observed for perceptually similar target-distractor pairs. Together, these results provide evidence for hierarchical processing in visual search: categorical properties influence spatial attention only when perceptual properties are insufficient to guide attention to the target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Individual Differences in Mental Information from Human Brain Response Predicted by Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Recent advantages of brain decoding with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have enabled us to estimate individual differences in mental information from brain responses to natural sensory inputs. However, the physical constraints and costs of fMRI measurements prevent brain decoding from achieving real-world applications. To address this issue, this study aims to build a framework to decode individual differences in mental information under natural situations via brain-response prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Once the CNN-based prediction model is constructed using measured brain response, mental information can be decoded from the predicted responses of individual brains with no additional fMRI measurements. As per our analysis, it was found that in 81 of 87 items to be decoded, this framework captured individual difference patterns consistent with conventional decoding using measured brain responses. Our framework has great potential to decode personal mental information with minimal fMRI measuring constraints or costs, which substantially expands the applicability of brain decoding in daily life.

                Landmark-based and self-motion-based navigation are two fundamental forms of spatial navigation, which involve distinct cognitive mechanisms. A critical question is whether these two navigation modes invoke common or distinct spatial representations for a given environment in the brain. While a number of electrophysiological studies in non-human animals have investigated this question but yielded inconsistent results, it still awaits rigorous investigation in humans. In the current study, we combined ultra-high field fMRI at 7T and desktop virtual reality with state-of-the-art fMRI data analysis techniques. Using a novel linear track navigation task, we dissociated the use of landmarks and self-motion cues, so that participants used different spatial cues to encode and retrieve the same set of spatial locations. Focusing on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus, we observed that RSC contained both cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations, which were driven by objective location (where the participant was actually located) and subjective location (the participant's self-reported location), respectively. The hippocampus showed strong functional coupling with RSC and exhibited a similar spatial coding scheme, but with reduced effect sizes. Taken together, the current study demonstrated for the first time concurrent cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations in RSC in the same spatial context, suggesting that this area might transform cue-specific spatial inputs into coherent cue-independent spatial representations to guide navigation behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensorimotor decisions rely on the entanglement of evidence and motor accumulation processes</a></h4>

              
                Most contemporary theories of sensorimotor decision-making formalize the process leading up to a decision as a gradual accumulation of stimulus information over time. In the currently prevailing view, the amount of accumulated evidence required for a decision is independent of the amount of sensory evidence presented by the stimulus, and once that level is reached, a choice is categorically communicated to the motor system to execute an overt response. Recent experiments cast doubt on these assumptions. We adopt a broader perspective by specifying a model with both an evidence and a motor accumulation process. The evidence accumulation signal feeds into a leaky motor accumulator, and it is on the level of the motor accumulation that the final decision criterion is set. We show that this alternative theory describes the behavioral data better, especially when it comes to urgency manipulations, and its neural correlates can be derived from EEG signatures involving systems of both evidence and motor accumulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of sound and locomotion information by auditory cortical neuronal ensembles</a></h4>

              
                The ability to process and act upon incoming sounds during locomotion is critical for survival. Intriguingly, sound responses of auditory cortical neurons are on average weaker during locomotion as compared to immobility and these results have been suggested to reflect a computational resource allocation shift from auditory to visual processing. However, the evolutionary benefit of this hypothesis remains unclear. In particular, whether weaker sound-evoked responses during locomotion indeed reflect a reduced involvement of the auditory cortex, or whether they result from an alternative neural computation in this state remains unresolved. To address this question, we first used neural inactivation in behaving mice and found that the auditory cortex plays a critical role in sound-guided behavior during locomotion. To investigate the nature of this processing, we used two-photon calcium imaging of local excitatory auditory cortical neural populations in awake mice. We found that underlying a net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked response magnitude, spatially intermingled neuronal subpopulations were differentially influenced by locomotion. Further, the net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked responses was strongly shaped by elevated ongoing activity. Importantly, rather than reflecting enhanced "noise", this ongoing activity reliably encoded the animals locomotion speed. Prediction analyses revealed that sound, locomotive state and their integration are strongly encoded by auditory cortical ensemble activity. Finally, we found consistent patterns of locomotion-sound integration in electrophysiologically recorded activity in freely moving rats. Together, our data suggest that auditory cortical ensembles are not simply suppressed by locomotion but rather encode it alongside sound information to support sound perception during locomotion.

                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a memory related neurodegenerative disorder mainly associated with older adults. In this study, transgenic Drosophila AD model has been employed to investigate the tau associated proteome. Tau expression was specifically induced in the eye tissues and diseased fly heads were considered for proteomic studies with appropriate controls. We have identified 6 novel proteins from tau induced AD group by 2D and PD Quest analyses and further characterized them by in-vivo and in-silico approaches. The novel Tau interactors, [Obp44a Isoform A, Pglym Isoform A, IP15846p (Adh variant), RE45450p (mRpL2), Retinin, and Glob1 Isoform B], identified by MALDI-TOF/MS were validated through q-RT-PCR. The altered metabolic, behavioral and mitochondrial dynamics associated with Tau over expressing AD flies could be due to the altered expression of Odorant binding protein 44a (Obp44a) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 (mRpL2), respectively. Further, we have showed for the first time the newly identified protein interaction with tau and other regulatory proteins through protein-protein docking, biocomputational classification and evolutionary relationship using in silico studies. Moreover, the study highlights the plausible role of these novel proteins in pathophysiology of phospho-tau induced AD flies and further help unraveling molecular pathways implicated in tauopathies.

                Neuromodulation interventions, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are proposed as possible new complementary therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). It is hypothesized that neuromodulation may induce neural plasticity in the reward and frontostriatal systems via electrical field induction, possibly reducing symptoms. Preclinical self-administration rodent models of AUD may help us gain insight into the effects of neuromodulation therapies on different pathology, as well as the neural mechanisms behind the positive effects. DBS, or any type of brain stimulation using intracranial electrodes in rodents, would benefit from the use of MRI to study the longitudinal effects and mechanisms of stimulation as well as novel targets, as it is a non-invasive technique that allows the analysis of structural and functional changes in the brain. To do this, there is a need for MRI-compatible electrodes that allow for MRI acquisition with minimal distortion of the magnetic field. In this protocol, we present a method for the construction and surgery of chronically implantable monopolar carbon electrodes for use in rats. Unlike conventional electrodes, carbon electrodes are resistant to high temperatures, flexible, and generate fewer artifacts in MRI compared to conventional ones. We validated its use by using a focal electrical stimulation high-frequency (20 Hz) protocol that lasted ~10 sessions. We propose that this technique can also be used for the research of the neurophysiological bases of the neuromodulatory treatment in other preclinical substance use disorders (SUD) models.

                Painful peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication associated with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection. Currently available treatments fail to provide adequate symptom relief, indicating the need for novel treatment strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we characterized the impact of cannabinoid CB2 agonists, which lack psychoactivity associated with central CB1 activation, on antiretroviral-induced neuropathic nociception and identified cell types expressing CB2 that mediate the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. Two structurally distinct CB2 agonists (AM1710 and LY2828360) alleviated antiretroviral-induced neuropathic pain, benefits which were absent in CB2 knockout mice. Conditional deletion of CB2 from peripheral sensory neurons eliminated the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. We also asked whether LY2828360 treatment could reverse established morphine tolerance in the ddC-induced neuropathy model and whether CB2 expression on peripheral sensory neurons is necessary for sparing of morphine tolerance by LY2828360. The present studies suggest that CB2 activation may alleviate HIV-associated antiretroviral neuropathy and identify a previously unreported mechanism through which CB2 activation produces antinociceptive efficacy. Our results also provide the first evidence that a CB2 agonist can reverse established morphine tolerance and demonstrate that CB2 localized to peripheral sensory neurons mediates the opioid tolerance sparing efficacy of CB2 agonists.

                A novel function for L1 cell adhesion molecule and its interaction with Ankyrin, an actin-spectrin adaptor protein, was identified in constraining dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons in the mouse neocortex. In an L1-null mouse mutant increased spine density was observed on apical but not basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in diverse cortical areas (prefrontal cortex layer 2/3, motor cortex layer 5, visual cortex layer 4).The Ankyrin binding motif (FIGQY) in L1's cytoplasmic domain was critical for spine formation, as demonstrated by increased spine density in the prefrontal cortex of a mouse mutant (L1YH) harboring a tyrosine to histidine mutation in this motif, which disrupts L1-Ankyrin association. This mutation is a known variant in the human L1 syndrome. In both mutants mature mushroom spines rather than immature spines were predominant. L1 was detected in spines and dendrites of wild-type prefrontal cortical neurons by immmunostaining. L1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ankyrin B (220 kDa) from cortical lysates of wild-type but not L1YH mice. Spine pruning assays in cortical neuron cultures from wild-type and L1YH mutant mice showed that the L1-Ankyrin interaction mediated spine retraction in response to the class 3 Semaphorins, Sema3F and to a lesser extent Sema3B. These ligands also induce spine pruning through other L1 family adhesion molecules, NrCAM and Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1), respectively. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of spine regulation and underscore the potential for this adhesion molecule to regulate cognitive and other L1-related functions that are abnormal in the L1 syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gray Matter Volumetric Correlates of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Traits in Emerging Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has demonstrated reduction in cortical and subcortical, including basal ganglia (BG), gray matter volumes (GMV) in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental condition that is more prevalent in males than in females. However, the volumetric deficits vary across studies. Whether volumetric reductions are more significant in males than females; to what extent these neural markers are heritable and relate to cognitive dysfunction in ADHD remain unclear. To address these questions, we followed published routines and performed voxel-based morphometry analysis of a data set (n = 11,502; 5,464 girls, 9-10 years) curated from the Adolescent Brain Cognition Development project, a population-based study of typically developing children. Of the sample, 634 and 2,826 were identified as monozygotic twins (MZ) and dizygotic twins/siblings (DZ), respectively. In linear regressions, a cluster in the hypothalamus showed larger GMV, and bilateral caudate and putamen, lateral orbitofrontal and occipital cortex showed smaller GMVs, in correlation with higher ADHD scores in girls and boys combined. When examined separately, boys relative to girls showed more widespread (including BG) and stronger associations between GMV deficits and ADHD scores. ADHD traits and the volumetric correlates demonstrated heritability estimates (a2) between 0.59 and 0.79, replicating prior findings of the genetic basis of ADHD. Further, ADHD traits and the volumetric correlates (except for the hypothalamus) were each negatively and positively correlated with N-back performance. Together, these findings confirm volumetric deficits in children with more prominent ADHD traits. Highly heritable in both girls and boys and potentially more significant in boys than in girls, the structural deficits underlie diminished capacity in working memory and potentially other cognitive deficits in ADHD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal dynamics of recognition memory for complex versus simple auditory sequences</a></h4>

              
                Differently from visual recognition, auditory recognition is a process relying on the organization of single elements that evolve in time. Here, we aimed to discover the spatiotemporal dynamics of this cognitive function by adopting a novel strategy for varying the complexity of musical sequences. We selected traditional tonal musical sequences and altered the distance between pitches to obtain matched atonal sequences. We then recorded the brain activity of 71 participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they listened to and later recognized auditory sequences constructed according to simple (tonal) or complex (atonal) conventions. Results reveal qualitative changes in neural activity dependent on stimulus complexity: recognition of tonal sequences engaged hippocampal and cingulate areas, whereas recognition of atonal sequences mainly activated the auditory processing network. Our findings highlight the involvement of a cortico-subcortical brain network for auditory recognition and support the idea that stimulus complexity qualitatively alters the neural pathways of recognition memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pathway and directional specificity of Hebbian plasticity induction in the cortical visual motion processing network</a></h4>

              
                Cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), which repeatedly pairs single pulse TMS over two distant brain regions with a specific time interval, is thought to modulate synaptic plasticity. Applied to the motion cortical pathway, ccPAS has been shown to improve motion discrimination when specifically targeting backward projections, stimulating the medio-temporal area (MT) followed by the primary visual cortex (V1). However, there is no direct neuroimaging evidence of the spatial selectivity of the ccPAS effects (i.e., pathway or direction specificity) or detailing the exact nature of the ccPAS effects (i.e., the oscillatory signature, timing). In this study, we applied ccPAS along the motion discrimination pathway, in the top-down direction (MT-to-V1: Backward ccPAS) and in the bottom-up direction (V1-to-MT: Forward ccPAS) in sixteen healthy volunteers and compared changes in visual network activity in response to single pulse TMS over V1 and MT using spectral granger causality (sGC). The sGC results showed common increases in direct V1-to-MT and V1-to-IPS bottom-up inputs in the high Beta/low Gamma band (25-40 Hz) for both ccPAS, probably reflecting task exposure. However, a clear distinction in information transfer occurred in the re-entrant MT-to-V1 signals, which were only modulated by Backward ccPAS. This difference was predictive of the behavioural improvements at the motion discrimination task. Our results support the view of the possibility to specifically enhance re-entrant Alpha oscillatory signals from MT-to-V1 to promote motion discrimination performance through Backward ccPAS. These findings contribute to better understanding visual processing in healthy subjects and how it can be modulated to pave the way to clinical translation in vision handicapped patients. The changes in re-entrant MT-to-V1 inputs could help to provide single-subject prediction scenarios in patients suffering from a visual system stroke, in whom visual recovery might partly rely on the top-down inputs to the spared V1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered Regulation of Ia Afferent Input during Voluntary Activity after Human Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input converging on the spinal cord contributes to the control of voluntary activity. Although sensory pathways reorganize following spinal cord injury (SCI), the extent to which sensory input from Ia afferents is regulated during voluntary activity after the injury remains largely unknown. To address this question, we examined the soleus H-reflex and conditioning of the H-reflex by stimulating homonymous and heteronymous nerves [depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by common peroneal nerve stimulation (D1 inhibition) and the monosynaptic Ia facilitation of the soleus H-reflex evoked by femoral nerve stimulation (FN facilitation)] at rest, and during tonic voluntary activity in humans with and without chronic incomplete SCI. We found that during voluntary activity the soleus H-reflex size increased in both groups compared with rest, but to a lesser extent in SCI participants. Compared with rest, the D1 inhibition decreased during voluntary activity in controls but it was still present in SCI participants. Further, the FN facilitation increased in controls but remained unchanged in SCI participants during voluntary activity compared with rest. Changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation were correlated with changes in the H-reflex during voluntary activity, suggesting an association between outcomes. These findings provide the first demonstration that the regulation of Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves is altered during voluntary in humans with SCI, resulting in lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trimethylamine N-oxide reduces neurite density and plaque intensity in a murine model of Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common aging-associated neurodegenerative disease; nevertheless, the etiology and progression of the disease is still incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the microbially-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD and positively correlates with increases in CSF biomarkers for tangle, plaque, and neuronal pathology. Objective: We assessed the direct impact of TMAO on AD progression. Methods: To do so, transgenic 5XFAD mice were supplemented with TMAO for 12 weeks. Results: Oral TMAO administration resulted in significantly reduced neurite density in several regions of the brain, as assessed through quantitative brain microstructure imaging with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Amyloid-{beta} plaque mean intensity was reduced, while plaque count and size remained unaltered. Proteomics analysis of the cortex revealed that TMAO treatment impacted the expression of 31 proteins (1.5-fold cut-off) in 5XFAD mice, including proteins known to influence neuronal health and amyloid-{beta} precursor protein processing. TMAO treatment did not alter astrocyte and microglial response (as determined by histological analysis) nor cortical synaptic protein expression. Conclusion: These data suggest that elevated plasma TMAO impacts AD pathology via reductions in neurite density.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interneurons of fan-shaped body promote arousal in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is required to maintain physiological functions and is widely conserved across species. To understand the sleep-regulatory mechanisms, sleep-regulating genes and neuronal circuits are studied in various animal species. In the sleep-regulatory neuronal circuits in Drosophila melanogaster, the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) is a major sleep-promoting region. However, other sleep-regulating neuronal circuits were not well identified. We recently found a novel sleep-regulatory circuit consisting of arousal-promoting T1 dopamine neurons and protocerebral bridge (PB) neurons innervating the ventral part of the FB, which we named ''the PB-FB pathway''. However, the post-synaptic target of the PB-FB pathway was still unknown. To identify it, we performed anterograde tracing, immunohistochemistry, and Ca2+ imaging analysis and found that the PB-FB pathway projects to FB interneurons, also known as pontine neurons. Besides, we found that cholinergic pontine neurons promote arousal. Moreover, we indicated that pontine neurons form an anatomical connection with sleep-promoting dFB neurons. Together, we showed that pontine neurons receive excitatory signals from the PB-FB pathway and cholinergic pontine neurons promote arousal. These results completed one of the output pathways from the PB-FB pathway.

                Background: While deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor functions in Parkinson's disease (PD), it has also been associated with increased impulsivity. Methods: A combined approach of eye-tracking and high-density EEG was used to investigate how high- and low-frequency DBS impact impulsive actions in the antisaccade task in a cohort of ten persons with PD. Computational modelling of the behavioral outcomes allowed a nuanced insight into the effect of DBS on response inhibition and action selection processes. Results: Against our expectations, both 130 Hz- and 60 Hz-DBS improved response inhibition as both resulted in a reduced rate of early reflexive errors. Correspondingly, DBS with both frequencies led to increased desynchronization of beta power during the preparatory period which may be a correlate of anticipatory activation in the oculomotor network. Low-frequency DBS additionally was associated with increased midfrontal theta power, an established marker of cognitive control. While higher midfrontal theta power predicted longer antisaccade latencies in off-DBS state on a trial-by-trial basis, 130 Hz-DBS reversed this relationship. As informed by the computational model, 130 Hz-DBS further led to a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off causing an acceleration and error-proneness of actions later in the trial. Conclusions: Our results disentangle the impact of DBS on early and late impulsive actions. Only 130 Hz-DBS may disrupt theta-mediated cognitive control mechanisms via medial frontal - STN pathways that are involved in delaying action selection. 60 Hz-DBS may provide beneficial effects on response inhibition without the detrimental effect on action selection seen with 130 Hz-DBS.

                The locus cruleus (LC) is the primary source of noradrenergic projections to the forebrain, and, in prefrontal cortex, is implicated in decision-making and executive function. LC neurons phase-lock to cortical slow wave oscillations during sleep. Such slow rhythms are rarely reported in awake states, despite their interest since they correspond to the time scale of behavior. Thus, we investigated LC neuronal synchrony with infra-slow rhythms in awake rats performing an attentional set-shifting task. Local field potential (LFPs) oscillation cycles in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on the order of 0.4 Hz phase-locked to task events at crucial maze locations. Indeed, successive cycles of the infra-slow rhythm showed different wavelengths, and thus these are not periodic oscillations. Simultaneously recorded infra-slow rhythms in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus showed different cycle durations as well. Most LC neurons (including optogenetically identified noradrenergic neurons) recorded here were phase-locked to these infra-slow rhythms, as were hippocampal and prefrontal units recorded on the LFP probes. The infra-slow oscillations also phase-modulated gamma amplitude, linking these rhythms at the time scale of behavior to those coordinating neuronal synchrony. Noradrenaline, released by LC neurons in concert with the infra-slow rhythm, would facilitate synchronizing or resetting those brain networks, underlying behavioral adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effect of Fas activation on spinal muscular atrophy motoneuron death and induction of axonal growth</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are the most common motoneuron diseases affecting adults and infants, respectively. ALS and SMA are both characterized by the selective degeneration of motoneurons. Although different in their genetic etiology, growing evidence indicate that they share molecular and cellular pathogenic signatures that constitute potential common therapeutic targets. We previously described a motoneuron-specific death pathway elicited by the Fas death receptor, whereby vulnerable ALS motoneurons show an exacerbated sensitivity to Fas activation. However, the mechanisms that drive the loss of SMA motoneurons remains poorly understood. Here, we describe an in vitro model of SMA-associated degeneration using primary motoneurons derived from Smn2B/- SMA mice and show that Fas activation selectively triggers death of the proximal motoneurons. Fas-induced death of SMA motoneurons has the molecular signature of the motoneuron-selective Fas death pathway that requires activation of p38 kinase, caspase-8, -9 and -3 as well as upregulation of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4). In addition, Rho Kinase (ROCK) is required for Fas recruitment. Remarkably, we found that exogenous activation of Fas also promotes axonal elongation in both wildtype and SMA motoneurons. Axon outgrowth of motoneurons promoted by Fas requires the activity of ERK, ROCK and caspases. This work defines a dual role of Fas signaling in motoneurons that can elicit distinct responses from cell death to axonal growth.

	<p>Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) often suffer from non-motor symptoms, which may be caused by serotonergic dysfunction. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may also influence non-motor symptoms. The aim of this study is to investigate how the cerebral 5-HT system associates to disturbances in cognition and mood in PD patients with DBS-STN turned on and off. We used psychological tests and questionnaires to evaluate cognitive function and the effects on mood from turning DBS-STN off. We applied a novel PET neuroimaging methodology to evaluate the integrity of the cerebral serotonin system. We measured 5-HT1BR binding in 13 DBS-STN-treated PD patients, at baseline and after turning DBS off. Thirteen age-matched volunteers served as controls. The measures for cognition and mood were correlated to the 5-HT1BR availability in temporal limbic cortex. 5-HT1BR binding was proportional to working memory performance and inverse proportional to affective bias for face recognition. When DBS is turned off, patients feel less vigorous; the higher the limbic and temporal 5-HT1BR binding, the more they are affected by DBS being turned off. Our study suggests that cerebral 5-HTR binding is associated with non-motor symptoms, and that preservation of serotonergic functions may be predictive of DBS-STN effects.</p>

	<p>Locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are controlled by glutamatergic inputs. Here, we studied in brain slices of neonatal rats NMDA and glutamate effects on phase-locked LC neuron spiking at ~1 Hz summating to ~0.2 s-lasting bell-shaped local field potential (LFP). NMDA: 10 &amp;amp;mu;M accelerated LFP 1.7-fold, whereas 25 and 50 &amp;amp;mu;M, respectively, increased its rate 3.2- and 4.6-fold while merging discrete events into 43 and 56% shorter oscillations. After 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 min, LFP oscillations stopped every 6 s for 1 s, resulting in &amp;amp;lsquo;oscillation trains&amp;amp;rsquo;. A dose of 32 &amp;amp;mu;M depolarized neurons by 8.4 mV to cause 7.2-fold accelerated spiking at reduced jitter and enhanced synchrony with the LFP, as evident from cross-correlation. Glutamate: 25&amp;amp;ndash;50 &amp;amp;mu;M made rhythm more irregular and the LFP pattern could transform into 2.7-fold longer-lasting multipeak discharge. In 100 &amp;amp;mu;M, LFP amplitude and duration declined. In 25&amp;amp;ndash;50 &amp;amp;mu;M, neurons depolarized by 5 mV to cause 3.7-fold acceleration of spiking that was less synchronized with LFP. Both agents: evoked &amp;amp;lsquo;post-agonist depression&amp;amp;rsquo; of LFP that correlated with the amplitude and kinetics of Vm hyperpolarization. The findings show that accelerated spiking during NMDA and glutamate is associated with enhanced or attenuated LC synchrony, respectively, causing distinct LFP pattern transformations. Shaping of LC population discharge dynamics by ionotropic glutamate receptors potentially fine-tunes its influence on brain functions.</p>

	<p>Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) signifies a failure in representing quantities, which impairs the performance of basic math operations and schooling achievement during childhood. The lack of specificity in assessment measures and respective cut-offs are the most challenging factors to identify children with DD, particularly in disadvantaged educational contexts. This research is focused on a numerical cognition battery for children, designed to diagnose DD through 12 subtests. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the prevalence of DD in a country with generally low educational attainment, by comparing z-scores and percentiles, and to test three neurodevelopmental models of numerical cognition based on performance in this battery. Participants were 304 Brazilian school children aged 7&amp;amp;ndash;12 years of both sexes (143 girls), assessed by the Zareki-R. Performances on subtests and the total score increase with age without gender differences. The prevalence of DD was 4.6% using the fifth percentile and increased to 7.4% via z-score (in total 22 out of 304 children were diagnosed with DD). We suggest that a minus 1.5 standard deviation in the total score of the Zareki-R is a useful criterion in the clinical or educational context. Nevertheless, a percentile &amp;amp;le; 5 seems more suitable for research purposes, especially in developing countries because the socioeconomic environment or/and educational background are strong confounder factors to diagnosis. The four-factor structure, based on von Aster and Shalev&amp;amp;rsquo;s model of numerical cognition (Number Sense, Number Comprehension, Number Production and Calculation), was the best model, with significant correlations ranging from 0.89 to 0.97 at the 0.001 level.</p>

	<p> Glioblastoma are the most common primary malignant brain tumors with a highly infiltrative behavior. The extent of resection of the enhancing component has been shown to be correlated to survival. Recently, it has been proposed to move the resection beyond the contrast-enhanced portion into the MR hyper intense tissue which typically surrounds the tumor, the so-called supra marginal resection (SMR). Though it should be associated with better overall survival (OS), a potential harmful resection must be avoided in order not to create new neurological deficits. Through this work, we aimed to perform a critical review of SMR in patients with Glioblastoma. A Medline database search and a pooled meta-analysis of HRs were conducted; 19 articles were included. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled OS HR of 0.64 (p = 0.052). SMR is generally considered as the resection of any T1w gadolinium-enhanced tumor exceeding FLAIR volume, but no consensus exists about the amount of volume that must be resected to have an OS gain. Equally, the role and the weight of several pre-operative features (tumor volume, location, eloquence, etc.), the intraoperative methods to extend resection, and the post-operative deficits, need to be considered more deeply in future studies</p>

	<p>Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders (TDs) are closely related and considered to etiologically overlap. Both disorders are characterized by repetitive behaviors. TD and OCD often co-occur. The high comorbidity between OCD and TD individuals suggests that we also need to pay more attention to the homogeneity and heterogeneity between TS and OCD. To date, there has been no systematic nationwide epidemiological survey of the mental health (including tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder) of children and adolescents in China. Methods: A two-stage epidemiological study of psychiatric point prevalence was conducted. We used the multistage cluster stratified random sampling strategy to assess five provinces of China. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to identify behavioral problems among the enrolled students in the first stage. The results from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents and evaluations from two psychiatrists based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV were used to make a diagnosis. Point weighted prevalence for TD and OCD was estimated. We adjusted prevalence estimates with the product of sampling weights and poststratification weights. Standard error values and 95% confidential intervals were generated with Taylor series linearization. Rao&amp;amp;ndash;Scott adjusted chi-square (&amp;amp;chi;2) tests were employed to compare the prevalence estimates of different age and sex groups. Results: In the first stage, 73,992 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;16 years old were selected. The prevalence rates of OCD and TDs were 1.37% (95% CI: 1.28&amp;amp;ndash;1.45) and 2.46% (95% CI: 2.35&amp;amp;ndash;2.57), respectively. The prevalence of OCD was found to be higher in girls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and higher in boys with transient tic disorder (TTD) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (TS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The most common comorbidity of TS was OCD (40.73%), and for OCD, it was TS (11.36%). Conclusions: Our study is the first nationwide survey on the prevalence of TD (2.46%) and OCD (1.37%) in school students aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;16 years old in China. The high comorbidity between OCD and TD individuals suggested overlap based on the prevalence dimensions, which might be influenced by age and sex. This result suggested that we also need to pay more attention to the homogeneity and heterogeneity between TS and OCD.</p>

                Miersch et al., used modular design principles to develop a tetravalent antibody format that can combine two antibodies into a single molecule. They show that a bi-paratopic tetravalent antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 behaves like conventional IgGs (e.g. yield, purity, stability, solubility) but potently and broadly inhibits variants that resist IgG drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Individualized Neural Tuning Model: Precise and generalizable cartography of functional architecture in individual brains</a></h4>

              
                How brain functional architecture differs across people is a key question of human neuroscience, and understanding these differences is critical for building brain-based biomarkers. However, current individualized models of brain functional organization are based on brain regions and networks, limiting their use to study fine-grained vertex- or voxel-level differences. In this work, we present the Individualized Neural Tuning (INT) model, a fine-grained individualized model of brain functional organization. The first part of the INT model models each individual's brain responses as a linearly transformed functional template, such that it captures both functional and topographic idiosyncrasies. The second part of the INT model factorizes the modeled brain responses, separating temporal information capturing how the stimulus changes over time (shared across individuals) and stimulus-general neural tuning (specific to each individual and each cortex). The two parts of the INT model are designed in such a way that (a) the INT model has vertex-level granularity; (b) it models both functional differences and topographic differences; and (c) the modeled neural tuning is stimulus-general in that it generalizes to new stimuli. Through a series of analyzes, we demonstrate that (a) the modeled brain functional organization is highly specific to the individual and reliable across independent data; (b) the model can predict an individual's responses to new stimuli based on others' responses, including category selectivity maps and retinotopic maps; (c) the model can predict fine-grained response patterns, which can be used to distinguish responses to different time points of a movie; (d) the model performance keeps improving with more data, but 10-20 minutes of movie are usually sufficient for good performance. Together, these analyses demonstrate that the INT model affords an individualized fine-grained model of brain functional architecture, which is reliable, precise, and generalizable across stimuli.

                The spinal cord and its interactions with the brain are fundamental for movement control and somatosensation. However, brain and spinal cord electrophysiology in humans have largely been treated as distinct enterprises, in part due to the relative inaccessibility of the spinal cord. Consequently, there is a dearth of knowledge on human spinal electrophysiology, including the multiple pathologies of the central nervous system that affect the spinal cord as well as the brain. Here we exploit recent advances in the development of wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) which can be flexibly arranged to provide coverage of both the spinal cord and the brain concurrently in unconstrained environments. Our system for magnetospinoencephalography (MSEG) measures both spinal and cortical signals simultaneously by employing a custom-made spinal scanning cast. We evidence the utility of such a system by recording simultaneous spinal and cortical evoked responses to median nerve stimulation, demonstrating the novel ability for concurrent non-invasive millisecond imaging of brain and spinal cord.

                Neurons from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the first to accumulate tau protein aggregates and degenerate during prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Here, we use a data-driven functional genomics approach to model ECII neurons in silico and identify the proto-oncogene DEK as a potential driver of tau pathology. By modulating DEK levels in EC neurons in vitro and in vivo, we first validate the accuracy and cell-type specificity of our network predictions. We then show that Dek silencing changes the inducibility of immediate early genes and alters neuron excitability, leading to dysregulation of neu- ronal plasticity genes. We further find that loss of function of DEK leads to tau accumulation in the soma of ECII neurons, reactivity of surrounding microglia, and eventually microglia-mediated neuron loss. This study validates a pathological gene discovery tool that opens new therapeutic avenues and sheds light on a novel pathway driving tau pathology in vulnerable neurons.

                The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its effector molecules-glucocorticoids-modulate diverse aspects of physiology in vertebrates ranging from metabolism to immune function, behavior, and circadian cycle. While the glucocorticoid receptor (nr3c1) is known to be involved in light adaptation (photoadaptation) of the retinal cells, the role of nr3c1 and other HPA axis signaling molecules in the behavioral phenotypes observed during photoadaptation have not been delineated. Therefore, we investigated locomotor adaptation to various light/dark durations using larval zebrafish that carry a mutated allele in key HPA axis receptors. First, we established baseline locomotion and compared WT and nr3c1 mutant larvae in constantly lit and dark conditions (for 12-hrs). WT larval zebrafish showed highest locomotor activity in the middle of the day and low activity during the early and later parts of the day, which was generally higher in the light. The baseline locomotion was depressed in nr3c1 mutants throughout the day in both environments with a more significant change noted in the light. Next, groups of larvae mutant in nr3c1, nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor), or mc2r (melanocortin receptor type 2; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor) along with their wildtype (WT) siblings were acclimated in the dark and underwent four cycles of dark-light illumination changes with different durations of illumination: 7.5, 6, 4, or 2 min. The nr3c1 and mc2r mutant fish showed significantly decreased locomotion during the dark phase when the illumination was provided for 4 or 2 min. However, with 4 min or longer illumination, if locomotor deficits were observed in mutant larvae, they demonstrated a "catch-up" phenotype with increasing locomotion during the later dark phases of the assay and ultimately reaching the swimming distances indistinguishable from their WT siblings in the assays with 7.5-min illumination. Finally, we looked at effects of light intensity, beginning with our short light exposure. A lower intensity of light failed to elicit any response even from WT fish after 1-min illumination. However, this dim light still evoked a robust response from nr3c1 mutants and their WT siblings after 7.5-min illumination. The nr3c2 mutant larvae consistently showed locomotor response similar to their WT siblings regardless of the length of the light phase. Thus, activation of the canonical HPA axis (i.e. nr3c1, mc2r) was necessary to induce a rapid locomotor adaptation following after light to dark transition with shorter light exposure times (< 4 min), but it was not needed for locomotor responses observed after longer exposure to light (> 4 min). Moreover, the locomotor response after transitioning to dark from a short (1 min) exposure was dependent on the intensity of light, whereas the longer exposure was not. Together, these findings suggest that locomotion after longer exposure to light is not dependent on the HPA axis, suggesting that either parallel independent pathway(s) are responsible for the locomotor response in these cases or that the HPA axis facilitates a primary pathway to increase sensitivity to light exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Category representations in the primary visual cortex support orientation discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual discrimination requires the ability to determine that two stimuli are different. It is well established that neuronal representations in sensory cortices (i.e. the specific neuronal activity patterns evoked by the stimuli) are essential for perceptual choice. Yet, the general principles by which those representations are compared in sensory systems remain paradoxically elusive. Indeed, the resolution of the neuronal representations is an order of magnitude more precise than the discrimination capabilities of the animals during behavioral tasks. This large discrepancy between theoretical neural resolution and actual animal discrimination threshold suggests that the integrative mechanisms leading to perceptual decision are computationally limited. To determine those computational constraints, we recorded the activity of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice performing a Go/NoGo orientation discrimination task. We found that two oriented cues were perfectly perceived as distinct when there was no overlap between their neuronal representations. However, at the limit of discriminability, V1 activity stopped encoding for the orientation of the visual stimulus. Instead, we observed a funneling of the V1 activity toward distinct domains of the orientation representation space, likely generated by an orientation-dependent modulation of the neuronal excitability. The relative neuronal activity at those domains provided a probabilistic indication that the stimulus belonged to the Go or NoGo category. Thus, the categorical classification by V1 of the presented stimulus predicts accurately the probabilities of the animals' perceptual decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disrupted Decision-Making: EcoHIV Inoculation Following a History of Cocaine Use</a></h4>

              
                Independently, chronic cocaine use and HIV-1 viral protein exposure induce neuroadaptations in the frontal-striatal circuit; how the frontal-striatal circuit responds to HIV-1 infection following chronic drug use, however, has remained elusive. After establishing a history of both sucrose and cocaine self-administration, a pretest-posttest experimental design was utilized to evaluate preference judgment, a simple form of decision-making dependent upon the integrity of frontal-striatal circuit function. During the pretest assessment, male rats exhibited a clear preference for cocaine, whereas female animals preferred sucrose. Two posttest evaluations (3 Days and 6 Weeks Post Inoculation) revealed that, independent of biological sex, inoculation with chimeric HIV (EcoHIV), but not saline, disrupted decision-making. Prominent structural alterations in frontal-striatal circuit dysfunction were evidenced by synaptodendritic alterations in pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, the EcoHIV rat affords a biological system to model how the frontal-striatal circuit responds to HIV-1 infection following chronic drug use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying the Neural Correlates of Balance Deficits in Traumatic Brain Injury using the Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC) analysis</a></h4>

              
                Balance impairment or the loss of balance control is one of the most debilitating consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The levels of balance impairment may not be necessarily associated with the severity level of TBI, which makes it more difficult to do the correlational analysis of the balance impairment and its neural underpinnings. Therefore, we conducted a study where we collected the neurophysiological data (EEG and EMG) during a balance control task on a computerized posturography platform in a group of 17 TBIs and 15 age-matched healthy controls. Further, to distinguish balance-impaired TBIs (BI-TBI) from non-impaired TBIs (BN-TBI), we stratified the level of balance impairment using the Berg Balance Scale, a functional outcome measure widely used in both research and clinical settings. We computed the brain functional connectivity features between different cortical regions of interest using the imaginary part of coherence in different frequency bands. These features are then studied in a mean-centered Partial Least Squares Correlation analysis, which is a data-driven framework with the advantage of handling more features than the number of samples, thus making it suitable for a small-sample study. Based on the nonparametric significance testing using permutation and bootstrap procedure, we noticed that theta-band connectivity strength in the following ROIs significantly contributed to distinguishing balance impaired from non-impaired population: left middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus, right precentral gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left post-central gyrus, right paracentral lobule. The knowledge of specific neural regions associated with balance impairment helps better understand neural mechanisms of TBI-associated balance dysfunction and may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted noninvasive brain stimulation. Our future studies will investigate the effects of balance platform training on sensorimotor connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generating parallel representations of position and identity in the olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                Sex pheromones are key social signals in most animals. In Drosophila a dedicated olfactory channel senses a male pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) that promotes female courtship while repelling males. Here we show that flies use separate cVA processing streams to extract qualitative and positional information. cVA olfactory neurons are sensitive to concentration differences in a 5 mm range around a male. Second-order projection neurons detect inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, encoding the angular position of a male. We identify a circuit mechanism increasing left-right contrast through an interneuron which provides contralateral inhibition. At the third layer of the circuit we identify neurons with distinct response properties and sensory integration motifs. One population is selectively tuned to an approaching male with speed-dependent responses. A second population responds tonically to a male's presence and controls female mating decisions. A third population integrates a male taste cue with cVA; only a simultaneous presentation of both signals promotes female mating via this pathway. Thus the olfactory system generates a range of complex percepts in discrete populations of central neurons that allow the expression of appropriate behaviors depending on context. Such separation of olfactory features resembles the mammalian what and where visual streams.

                Opioid discontinuation generates a withdrawal syndrome marked by a negative emotional state. Increased anxiety and dysphoria during opioid discontinuation are a significant barrier to achieving long-term abstinence in opioid-dependent individuals. Adaptations in brain-reward circuitry are implicated in the opioid abstinence syndrome, but current knowledge is limited to changes following natural and semi-synthetic opioids. Here we report abstinence from the synthetic opioid fentanyl engenders structural, functional, and molecular plasticity in nucleus accumbens neuron subtypes (MSNs) that mediate negative emotional behaviors. We show fentanyl abstinence causes dendritic atrophy and increased excitatory drive exclusive to D1-receptor containing MSNs. Using subtype specific RNAseq and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, we identified molecular signatures of fentanyl abstinence in MSN subtypes. We found a network of co-expressed genes downregulated selectively in D1-MSNs, and transcriptionally co-regulated by E2F1. We show targeting abstinence-induced molecular changes protects D1-MSNs from maladaptive plasticity and alleviates negative emotional behaviors after fentanyl abstinence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active licking shapes cortical taste coding.</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from >500 single GC neurons in mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which spike rate and spike timing or phase relative to licks are used by coding neurons in distinguishing tastes. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further significant finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish between tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction of Stroke Outcome in Mice Based on Non-Invasive MRI and Behavioral Testing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prediction of post-stroke outcome using the degree of subacute deficit or magnetic resonance imaging metrics is well studied in humans. While mice are the most commonly used animals in pre-clinical stroke research, systematic analysis of outcome predictors is lacking. Methods: Data from a total of 13 studies that included 45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion on 148 mice were pooled. Motor function was measured using a modified protocol for the staircase test of skilled reaching. Phases of subacute and residual deficit were defined. Magnetic resonance images of stroke lesions were co-registered on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to characterize stroke topology. Different random forest prediction models that either used motor-functional deficit or imaging parameters were generated for the subacute and residual deficits. Results: We detected both a subacute and residual motor-functional deficit after stroke in mice. Different functional severity grades and recovery trajectories could be observed. We found that lesion volume is the best predictor of subacute deficit. The residual deficit can be predicted most accurately by the degree of the subacute deficit. When using imaging parameters for the prediction of the residual deficit, including information about the lesion topology increases prediction accuracy. A subset of anatomical regions within the ischemic lesion have an outstanding impact on the prediction of long-term outcome. Prediction accuracy depends on the degree of functional impairment. Conclusions: For the first time, we identified and characterized predictors of post-stroke outcome in a large cohort of mice and found strong concordance with clinical data. In the future, using outcome prediction can improve the design of pre-clinical studies and guide intervention decisions.

                Sleep oscillations provide a key substrate to facilitate memory processing, the underlying mechanism of which may involve the overnight homeostatic regulation of plasticity at a synaptic and whole-network level. However, there remains a lack of human data demonstrating if and how sleep enhances memory consolidation and associated neural homeostasis. We combined intracranial recordings and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in humans to reveal a new role for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in promoting the homeostatic recalibration of optimal excitation/inhibition-balance. Moreover, the extent of this REM-sleep homeostatic recalibration predicted the success of overnight memory consolidation, expressly the modulation of hippocampal-neocortical excitability favoring remembering rather than forgetting. The findings describe a novel, fundamental role of human REM sleep in maintaining neural homeostasis thereby enhancing long-term memory

                Cognitive tests sensitive to the integrity of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), such as mnemonic discrimination of perceptually similar stimuli, may be useful early markers of risk for cognitive decline in older populations. Perceptual discrimination of stimuli with overlapping features also relies on MTL, but remains relatively unexplored in this context. We assessed mnemonic discrimination in two test formats (Forced Choice, Yes/No) and perceptual discrimination of objects and scenes in 111 community-dwelling older adults at different risk status for cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological screening. We also investigated associations between performance and MTL subregion volume and thickness. The at-risk group exhibited reduced entorhinal thickness and impaired perceptual and mnemonic discrimination. Perceptual discrimination impairment partially explained group differences in mnemonic discrimination and correlated with entorhinal thickness. Executive dysfunction accounted for Yes/No deficits in at-risk adults, demonstrating the importance of test format for the interpretation of memory decline. These results suggest that perceptual discrimination tasks may be useful tools for detecting incipient cognitive impairment related to reduced MTL integrity in non-clinical populations.

	<p>Purpose: Neuropathic pain often originates from nerve injury or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system. However, its specific pathogenesis remains unclear. The requirement for excitatory synaptic plasticity in pain-related syndromes has been demonstrated. A recent study reported that pentraxin-3 is important in glutamatergic synaptic formation and function. Meanwhile, nectin-1 mediates synaptogenesis in neurological disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate whether pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 modulate spinal nerve damage-related neuropathic pain in male mice. Methods: L4 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in male mice was performed to induce experimental neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia following SNL were based on paw withdrawal (PW) threshold and PW latency, respectively. Spinal pentraxin-3 levels and nectin-1 expression following SNL were examined. Pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 knockdown models were established by the shRNA method. These models were used with a recombinant pentraxin-3 cell model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SNL. Results: The SNL operation generated persistent decreases in mechanical PW threshold and thermal PW latency, with subsequent long-lasting elevations in spinal pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 expression levels. Pentraxin-3 knockdown reduced SNL-associated neuropathic pain behaviors as well as nectin-1 amounts in the spinal dorsal horn. Nectin-1 deficiency impaired mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia following spinal nerve injury. The application of recombinant pentraxin-3 in the spinal cord triggered an acute nociception phenotype and induced spinal overexpression of nectin-1. The intrathecal knockdown of nectin-1 prevented exogenous pentraxin-3-evoked pain hypersensitivity. Conclusions: The findings suggest spinal pentraxin-3 is required for SNL-triggered neuropathic pain via nectin-1 upregulation in male mice.</p>

	<p>Perception of the same narrative can vary between individuals depending on a listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s previous experiences. We studied whether and how cultural family background may shape the processing of an audiobook in the human brain. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 48 healthy volunteers from two different cultural family backgrounds listened to an audiobook depicting the intercultural social life of young adults with the respective cultural backgrounds. Shared cultural family background increased inter-subject correlation of hemodynamic activity in the left-hemispheric Heschl&amp;amp;rsquo;s gyrus, insula, superior temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, in the right-hemispheric lateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortices as well as in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus and precuneus. Thus, cultural family background is reflected in multiple areas of speech processing in the brain and may also modulate visual imagery. After neuroimaging, the participants listened to the narrative again and, after each passage, produced a list of words that had been on their minds when they heard the audiobook during neuroimaging. Cultural family background was reflected as semantic differences in these word lists as quantified by a word2vec-generated semantic model. Our findings may depict enhanced mutual understanding between persons who share similar cultural family backgrounds.</p>

     alt="Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging quantification of gray matter alterations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging-derived myelin volume fraction, we showed gray matter alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Our findings suggested extensive neuroinflammation, along with a lesser extent demyelination and neuronal loss in RRMS. In contrast, we observed substantial neuronal loss with no evidence of demyelination and neuroinflammation in NMOSD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Herein, we combined neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) to evaluate the spatial distribution and extent of gray matter (GM) microstructural alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The NODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index [ODI], and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and SyMRI (myelin volume fraction [MVF]) measures were compared between age- and sex-matched groups of 30 patients with RRMS (6 males and 24 females; mean age, 51.43 ± 8.02 years), 18 patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD (2 males and 16 females; mean age, 52.67 ± 16.07 years), and 19 healthy controls (6 males and 13 females; mean age, 51.47 ± 9.25 years) using GM-based spatial statistical analysis. Patients with RRMS showed reduced NDI and MVF and increased ODI and ISOVF, predominantly in the limbic and paralimbic regions, when compared with healthy controls, while only increases in ODI and ISOVF were observed when compared with NMOSD. Compared to NDI and MVF, the changes in ODI and ISOVF were observed more widely, including in the cerebellar cortex. These abnormalities were associated with disease progression and disability. In contrast, patients with NMOSD only showed reduced NDI mainly in the cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic cortices when compared with healthy controls and patients with RRMS. Taken together, our study supports the notion that GM pathologies in RRMS are distinct from those of NMOSD. However, owing to the limitations of the study, the results should be cautiously interpreted.</p>

<p>Hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly different in ME/CFS, especially in patients meeting ICC criteria. Hippocampal subfield volumes correlated with ME/CFS clinical measures. For example, smaller subfield volumes were associated with higher pain and fatigue levels in ME/CFS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients suffer from a cognitive and memory dysfunction. Because the hippocampus plays a key role in both cognition and memory, we tested for volumetric differences in the subfields of the hippocampus in ME/CFS. We estimated hippocampal subfield volumes for 25 ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria only (ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>), 18 ME/CFS patients who met the stricter ICC criteria (ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub>), and 25 healthy controls (HC). Group comparisons with HC detected extensive differences in subfield volumes in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> but not in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>. ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients had significantly <i>larger</i> volume in the left subiculum head (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), left presubiculum head (<i>p</i> = 0.0020), and left fimbria (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Correlations of hippocampus subfield volumes with clinical measures were stronger in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> than in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients. In ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients, we detected positive correlations between fatigue and hippocampus subfield volumes and a negative correlation between sleep disturbance score and the right CA1 body volume. In ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients, we detected a strong negative relationship between fatigue and left hippocampus tail volume. Strong negative relationships were also detected between pain and SF36 physical scores and two hippocampal subfield volumes (left: GC-ML-DG head and CA4 head). Our study demonstrated that volumetric differences in hippocampal subfields have strong statistical inference for patients meeting the ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> case definition and confirms hippocampal involvement in the cognitive and memory problems of ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients.</p>

<p><i>Bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) mutant mice were validated as a model of Kabuki syndrome as they were more susceptible to infections. Juvenile <i>bapa</i> mice also presented dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Juvenile control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted a novel vocalization pattern: 31-kHz.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The recessive mutant mouse <i>bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Previous studies of our group revealed some behavioral impairments and a mutation in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (Kmt2d) gene. Because mutations in the KMT2D gene in humans are mainly responsible for Kabuki syndrome, this study was proposed to validate <i>bapa</i> mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome. Besides other symptoms, Kabuki syndrome is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and speech impairments, usually diagnosed in the early childhood. Thus, juvenile male and female <i>bapa</i> mice were studied in different developmental stages (prepubertal period and puberty). To induce sickness behavior and to study infection susceptibility responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used. To study oral communication, ultrasonic vocalizations were evaluated. Behavioral (open-field test) and central (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) evaluations were also performed. Control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted 31-kHz ultrasounds on prepubertal period when exploring a novel environment, a frequency not yet described for mice, being defined as 31-kHz exploratory vocalizations. Males, LPS, and puberty inhibited these vocalizations. <i>Bapa</i> mice presented increased motor/exploratory behaviors on prepubertal period due to increased striatal TH expression, revealing striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Combining open-field behavior and GFAP expression, <i>bapa</i> mice did not develop LPS tolerance, that is, they remained expressing signs of sickness behavior after LPS challenge, being more susceptible to infectious/inflammatory processes. It was concluded that <i>bapa</i> mice is a robust experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

<p>This dynamic functional connectivity (FC) study suggests that adolescent depression is characterized by unstable network dynamic pattern, altered state transition metrics, and disrupted FC in a weakly connected state. Furthermore, mean dwell time in this weakly connected state is associated with disease severity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states—a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

     alt="Childhood trauma exposure and reward processing in healthy adults: A functional neuroimaging study"/>
<p>Childhood abuse was associated with increased ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and income. Overall childhood trauma and childhood neglect were not associated with significant activation changes in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation or the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The association between childhood trauma exposure and risk of developing psychopathology may in part be mediated by the effects of chronic stress on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, little is known about the differential effects of distinct trauma types on reward processing, particularly in adults without concurrent medical or psychiatric disorders. We examined the association of childhood trauma exposure, including the differential effects of abuse and neglect, with reward processing in healthy adults (<i>n</i> = 114). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was used to assess neural activity in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in relation to reward anticipation and reward outcome, respectively. Exposure to childhood trauma, including abuse and neglect, was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. We found a significant effect for abuse on ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and household monthly income. There were no effects for abuse or neglect, independently or combined, on orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome. Our findings suggest differential effects of childhood abuse on ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation in healthy adults.</p>

To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit–mass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8 ± 3.1 mm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7 ± 1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4 ± 3.2 mm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

     alt="Serotonin 5-HT7 receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area produces antidepressive effect and affects brain serotonin system in male mice"/>
<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both “normal” C57Bl/6J and “depressive” ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in “depressive” ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of the lateral septum in neuropsychiatric disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is a structure in the midline of the brain that is interconnected with areas associated with stress and feeding. This review highlights the role of the LS in anxiety, depression, and eating disorders and their comorbidity. There is a prevailing view that the LS is anxiolytic. This review finds that the LS is both anxiolytic and anxiogenic. Furthermore, the LS can promote and inhibit feeding. Given these shared roles, the LS represents a common site for the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric disorders, and therefore a potential pharmacological target. This is crucial since currently available treatments are not always effective. Corticotrophin-releasing factor 2 antagonists are potential drugs for the treatment of anxiety and anorexia and require further research. Furthermore, other drugs currently in trials for binge eating, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, may in fact promote food intake. It is hoped that the advancements in chemo- and optogenetic techniques will allow future studies to profile the specific neural connections of the LS and their function. This information could facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and therefore pharmacological targets, of these psychiatric conditions.</p>

     alt="Altered basal ganglia infraslow oscillation and resting functional connectivity in complex regional pain syndrome"/>
<p>This study is the first systematic evaluation of functional connectivity of basal ganglia motor and non-motor territories in CRPS. In CRPS, there is increased ISOs and resting functional connectivity in motor but not in non-motor basal ganglia territories (except caudate body functional connectivity) compared to controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition commonly accompanied by movement disturbances and often affects the upper limbs. The basal ganglia motor loop is central to movement, however, non-motor basal ganglia loops are involved in pain, sensory integration, visual processing, cognition, and emotion. Systematic evaluation of each basal ganglia functional loop and its relation to motor and non-motor disturbances in CRPS has not been investigated. We recruited 15 upper limb CRPS and 45 matched healthy control subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, infraslow oscillations (ISO) and resting-state functional connectivity in motor and non-motor basal ganglia loops were investigated using putamen and caudate seeds. Compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased ISO power in the putamen contralateral to the CRPS affected limb, specifically, in contralateral putamen areas representing the supplementary motor area hand, motor hand, and motor tongue. Furthermore, compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased resting connectivity between these putaminal areas as well as from the caudate body to cortical areas such as the primary motor cortex, supplementary and cingulate motor areas, parietal association areas, and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate changes in basal ganglia loop function in CRPS subjects and may underpin motor disturbances of CRPS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexing the principal gradient of the cerebral cortex to suit changing semantic task demands</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how thought emerges from the topographical structure of the cerebral cortex is a primary goal of cognitive neuroscience. Recent work has revealed a principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity capturing the separation of sensory-motor cortex from transmodal regions of the default mode network (DMN); this is thought to facilitate memory-guided cognition. However, studies have not explored how this dimension of connectivity changes when conceptual retrieval is controlled to suit the context. We used gradient decomposition of informational connectivity in a semantic association task to establish how the similarity in connectivity across brain regions changes during familiar and more original patterns of retrieval. Multivoxel activation patterns at opposite ends of the principal gradient were more divergent when participants retrieved stronger associations; therefore when long-term semantic information is sufficient for ongoing cognition, regions supporting heteromodal memory are functionally separated from sensory-motor experience. In contrast, when less related concepts were linked, this dimension of connectivity was reduced in strength as semantic control regions separated from the DMN to generate more flexible and original responses. We also observed fewer dimensions within the neural response towards the apex of the principal gradient when strong associations were retrieved, reflecting less complex or varied neural coding across trials and participants. In this way, the principal gradient explains how semantic cognition is organised in the human cerebral cortex: the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct population and single-neuron selectivity for executive and episodic processing in human dorsal posterior cingulate</a></h4>

              
                Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is an enigmatic region implicated in psychiatric and neurological disease, yet its role in cognition remains unclear. Human studies link PCC to episodic memory and default mode network (DMN), while findings from the non-human primate emphasize executive processes more associated with the cognitive control network (CCN) in humans. We hypothesized this difference reflects an important functional division between dorsal (executive) and ventral (episodic) PCC. To test this, we utilized human intracranial recordings of population and single unit activity targeting dorsal PCC during an alternated executive/episodic processing task. Dorsal PCC population responses were significantly enhanced for executive, compared to episodic, task conditions, consistent with the CCN. Single unit recordings, however, revealed four distinct functional types with unique executive (CCN) or episodic (DMN) response profiles. Our findings provide critical electrophysiological data from human PCC, bridging incongruent views within and across species, furthering our understanding of PCC function.

                Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal oscillations associated with memory consolidation. The subiculum, as the hippocampal output structure, ensures that hippocampal memory representations are transferred correctly to the consolidating neocortical regions. Because patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often develop memory deficits, we hypothesized that epileptic networks may disrupt subicular SWRs. We therefore investigated the impact of experimentally induced status epilepticus (SE) on subicular SWRs and contributing pyramidal neurons using electrophysiological recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Subicular SWRs expressed hyperexcitable features post-SE, including increased ripple and unit activity. While regular firing neurons normally remain silent during SWRs, selective disinhibition recruited more regular firing neurons for action potential generation during SWRs post-SE. By contrast, burster neurons generated fewer action potential bursts during SWRs post-SE. Furthermore, altered timing of postsynaptic and action potentials suggested distorted neuronal recruitment during SWRs. Distorted subicular SWRs may therefore impair information processing and memory consolidation in epilepsy.

                The L1 cell adhesion molecule NrCAM (Neuron-glia related cell adhesion molecule) functions as a co-receptor for secreted class 3 Semaphorins to prune subpopulations of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse neocortex. The developing spine cytoskeleton is enriched in actin filaments but a small number of microtubules have been shown to enter the spine apparently trafficking vesicles to the membrane. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a member of the Doublecortin (DCX) family of microtubule-binding proteins with serine/threonine kinase activity. To determine if DCLK1 plays a role in spine remodeling, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse line (Nex1Cre-ERT2: DCLK1flox/flox : RCE) to delete microtubule binding isoforms of DCLK1 from pyramidal neurons during postnatal stages of spine development. Homozygous DCLK1 conditional mutant mice exhibited decreased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (layer 2/3). Mature mushroom spines were selectively decreased upon DCLK1 deletion but dendritic arborization was unaltered. Mutagenesis and binding studies revealed that DCLK1 bound NrCAM at the conserved FIGQY1231 motif in the NrCAM cytoplasmic domain, a known interaction site for the actin-spectrin adaptor Ankyrin. These findings demonstrate that DCLK1 facilitates spine growth and maturation on cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex potentially through microtubule and NrCAM interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of reading and face circuits during the first three years of reading acquisition</a></h4>

              
                Although words and faces activate neighboring regions in the fusiform gyrus, we lack an understanding of how such category selectivity emerges during development. To investigate the organization of reading and face circuits at the earliest stage of reading acquisition, we measured the fMRI responses to words, faces, houses, and checkerboards in three groups of 60 French children: 6-year-old pre-readers, 6-year-old beginning readers and 9-year-old advanced readers. The results showed that specific responses to written words were absent prior to reading, but emerged in beginning readers, irrespective of age. Likewise, specific responses to faces were barely visible in pre-readers and continued to evolve in the 9-year-olds, yet primarily driven by age rather than by schooling. Crucially, the sectors of ventral visual cortex that become specialized for words and faces harbored their own functional connectivity prior to reading acquisition: the VWFA with left-hemispheric spoken language areas, and the FFA with the contralateral region and the amygdalae. The results support the view that reading acquisition occurs through the recycling of a pre-existing but plastic circuit which, in pre-readers, already connects the VWFA site to other distant language areas. We argue that reading acquisition does not compete with the face system directly, through a pruning of preexisting face responses, but indirectly, by hindering the slow growth of face responses in the left hemisphere, thus increasing a pre-existing right hemispheric bias.

	<p>Cognitive control is essential to daily life. Task switching is a classical paradigm used to study cognitive control. Previous researchers have studied the representation of different abstract hierarchical rules in the prefrontal cortex and explored the process mechanisms of task switching. However, the differences between the different hierarchical levels of task switching, especially the related neural mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex, are still unclear. This review focuses on and summarizes this issue. The present study suggests that the higher the hierarchical rule shifting or task switching, the more anterior the activation is on the prefrontal cortex. In addition, a high hierarchy of rules or tasks is more abstract, which leads to a larger switching cost.</p>

	<p>Rhythmic passive movements are often used during rehabilitation to improve physical functions. Previous studies have explored oscillatory activities in the sensorimotor cortex during active movements; however, the relationship between movement rhythms and oscillatory activities during passive movements has not been substantially tested. Therefore, we aimed to quantitatively identify changes in cortical oscillations during rhythmic passive movements. Twenty healthy young adults participated in our study. We placed electroencephalography electrodes over a nine-position grid; the center was oriented on the transcranial magnetic stimulation hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle. Passive movements included elbow flexion and extension; the participants were instructed to perform rhythmic elbow flexion and extension in response to the blinking of 0.67 Hz light-emitting diode lamps. The coherence between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations near the hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle and passive movement rhythms was higher than that between alpha oscillation and passive movement rhythm. These results imply that alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations of the primary motor cortex are differently related to passive movement rhythm.</p>

	<p>Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed important aspects of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine suggesting abnormal brain energy metabolism and altered functional connectivity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies investigated migraine patients in the interictal or ictal state. This first-of-its-kind study aimed to investigate the whole migraine cycle using 1H-MRS and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A migraine patient underwent 1H-MRS and resting-state fMRI for 21 consecutive days, regardless of whether he was in an interictal or ictal state. Metabolite ratios were assessed and compared to the intrinsic connectivity of subcortical brain areas. Probable migraine phase-dependent changes in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) and choline (Cho)/tCr levels are found in the left occipital lobe and left basal ganglia. NAA reflects neuronal integrity and Cho cellular membrane turnover. Such abnormalities may increase the susceptibility to excitatory migraine triggers. Functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and right or left pallidum was strongly correlated to the NAA/Cho ratio in the right thalamus, suggesting neurochemical modulation of these brain areas through thalamic connections. To draw statistically significant conclusions a larger cohort is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptotagmin-7 Enhances Facilitation of Cav2.1 Calcium Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 undergoes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation and inactivation, which are important in short-term synaptic plasticity. In presynaptic terminals, Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 forms large protein complexes that include synaptotagmins. Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) is essential to mediate short-term synaptic plasticity in many synapses. Here, based on evidence that Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and Syt-7 are both required for short-term synaptic facilitation, we investigated the direct interaction of Syt-7 with Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and probed its regulation of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 function. We found that Syt-7 binds specifically to the &alpha;<SUB>1A</SUB> subunit of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 through interaction with the synaptic-protein interaction (synprint) site. Surprisingly, this interaction enhances facilitation in paired-pulse protocols and accelerates the onset of facilitation. Syt-7&alpha; induces a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and slows Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation, whereas Syt-7&beta; and Syt-7 have smaller effects. Our results identify an unexpected, isoform-specific interaction between Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and Syt-7 through the synprint site, which enhances Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 facilitation and modulates its inactivation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Speed Estimation for Visual Tracking Emerges Dynamically from Nonlinear Frequency Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensing the movement of fast objects within our visual environments is essential for controlling actions. It requires online estimation of motion direction and speed. We probed human speed representation using ocular tracking of stimuli of different statistics. First, we compared ocular responses to single drifting gratings (DGs) with a given set of spatiotemporal frequencies to broadband motion clouds (MCs) of matched mean frequencies. Motion energy distributions of gratings and clouds are point-like, and ellipses oriented along the constant speed axis, respectively. Sampling frequency space, MCs elicited stronger, less variable, and speed-tuned responses. DGs yielded weaker and more frequency-tuned responses. Second, we measured responses to patterns made of two or three components covering a range of orientations within Fourier space. Early tracking initiation of the patterns was best predicted by a linear combination of components before nonlinear interactions emerged to shape later dynamics. Inputs are supralinearly integrated along an iso-velocity line and sublinearly integrated away from it. A dynamical probabilistic model characterizes these interactions as an excitatory pooling along the iso-velocity line and inhibition along the orthogonal "scale" axis. Such crossed patterns of interaction would appropriately integrate or segment moving objects. This study supports the novel idea that speed estimation is better framed as a dynamic channel interaction organized along speed and scale axes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainable development of smart cities and smart territories based on the model of minimizing externalities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The development of conceptual models of a digital city poses numerous challenges for developers. The public sector concept model has become one of the most difficult models to use. When developing algorithms to find a solution, the multidirectional interests of businesses and public institutions are combined. This type of model reflects the most acute and urgent problems faced by megapolises with regard to combining numerous localized services provided to the community in a limited territory. The administrations of both cities and regions (the scale of the smart territories) must make decisions concerning overcoming the barriers existing between the profits of commercial structures, the negative externalities generated by their activities, and the social benefits to the population in the territory under their control. It is necessary to solve this problem to achieve the effective management of enterprises belonging to the segment of long-term participants in various business activities, interacting with the surrounding social and business environment in a complex. This study takes into account the complex structures of the economic processes characteristic of megacities. The periodicity of economic processes is also taken into account. When choosing an optimization criterion, functions reflecting the level of internalization of responsibility for external effects were considered. The authors propose a mathematical model that can be used as part of the management decision support systems software, aiming at taking into account the externalities of a wide range of national, institutional, business, and social activities.

                Background: Silkworm cocoons are materials that have fine regenerating abilities for the human body. Fibroin and sericin present in silkworm cocoons (Bombyx mori) are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to know the effects of the use of wound dressing from silkworm cocoons toward COX-2 expression and neutrophils number in the inflammatory phase after skin excision. Methods: Twelve male Wistar rats according to inclusion criteria were randomly divided into 4 groups, each group of 6, based on the decapitation time (the 3rd day and the 6th day) and based on the dressing material (moist gauze dressing as the control group and silkworm cocoons as the treatment group). Each group was performed an excision on the dorsal skin with subcutaneous depth using a 4 mm-round punch biopsy. Neutrophil cell observations were performed by Hematoxylin eosin staining (HE). COX-2 expression was found in preparations for immunohistochemical staining using rabbit monoclonal COX-2 antibody at sacrificed period on the 3rd and the 6th day after wound dressing application. Results: The number of neutrophils and expression of COX-2 were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA and Independent t-test. The results showed a significant decrease in the number of COX-2 expression on inflammatory cells as well as the number of neutrophils (p<0.005) in the groups treated with wound dressing from silkworm cocoons on both the 3rd and 6th day. Conclusions: It was concluded that the use of wound dressing from silkworm cocoons can inhibit COX-2 expression (p=0,000) and decrease the number of neutrophils in the inflammatory phase after skin excision (p=0,001).

                Background: The optimal neonatal resuscitation requires healthcare personnel knowledge and experience. This study aims to assess the readiness of hospitals through its healthcare personnel in performing neonatal resuscitation. Methods: This study was an observational study conducted in May 2021 by distributing questionnaires to nurses, midwives, doctors, and residents to determine the level of knowledge and experience of the subject regarding neonatal resuscitation. We conducted the research in four types of hospitals A, B, C, and D, which are defined by the Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia by the capability and availability of medical services. The type A hospital is the hospital with the most complete medical services, while type D hospitals have the least medical services. The comparative analysis between participants’ characteristics and the knowledge or experience score was conducted.  Results: The total 123 participants are included in the knowledge questionnaire analysis and 70 participants are included in the resuscitation experience analysis. We showed a significant difference (p = 0.013) of healthcare personnel knowledge between the A type hospital (Median 15.00; Interquartile Range [IQR] 15.00–16.00) and the C type hospital (median 14.50; IQR 12.25–15.75). For the experience, the healthcare personnel of type A and type B hospitals have significantly higher experience scores than the type D hospital (p = 0.014; p = 0.007), but we did not find a significant difference between others type of hospital comparison. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the healthcare personnel from type A and type B hospitals are more experienced than the type D hospital in conducting neonatal resuscitation. We suggest more neonatal resuscitation training to improve the readiness of healthcare personnel from type C and type D hospital.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accurate, high-coverage assignment of in vivo protein kinases to phosphosites from in vitro phosphoproteomic specificity data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brandon M. Invergo</p>

Phosphoproteomic experiments routinely observe thousands of phosphorylation sites. To understand the intracellular signaling processes that generated this data, one or more causal protein kinases must be assigned to each phosphosite. However, limited knowledge of kinase specificity typically restricts assignments to a small subset of a kinome. Starting from a statistical model of a high-throughput, <i>in vitro</i> kinase-substrate assay, I have developed an approach to high-coverage, multi-label kinase-substrate assignment called IV-KAPhE (“<i>In vivo</i>-Kinase Assignment for Phosphorylation Evidence”). Tested on human data, IV-KAPhE outperforms other methods of similar scope. Such computational methods generally predict a densely connected kinase-substrate network, with most sites targeted by multiple kinases, pointing either to unaccounted-for biochemical constraints or significant cross-talk and signaling redundancy. I show that such predictions can potentially identify biased kinase-site misannotations within families of closely related kinase isozymes and they provide a robust basis for kinase activity analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CrowdGO: Machine learning and semantic similarity guided consensus Gene Ontology annotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maarten J. M. F. Reijnders, Robert M. Waterhouse</p>

Characterising gene function for the ever-increasing number and diversity of species with annotated genomes relies almost entirely on computational prediction methods. These software are also numerous and diverse, each with different strengths and weaknesses as revealed through community benchmarking efforts. Meta-predictors that assess consensus and conflict from individual algorithms should deliver enhanced functional annotations. To exploit the benefits of meta-approaches, we developed CrowdGO, an open-source consensus-based Gene Ontology (GO) term meta-predictor that employs machine learning models with GO term semantic similarities and information contents. By re-evaluating each gene-term annotation, a consensus dataset is produced with high-scoring confident annotations and low-scoring rejected annotations. Applying CrowdGO to results from a deep learning-based, a sequence similarity-based, and two protein domain-based methods, delivers consensus annotations with improved precision and recall. Furthermore, using standard evaluation measures CrowdGO performance matches that of the community’s best performing individual methods. CrowdGO therefore offers a model-informed approach to leverage strengths of individual predictors and produce comprehensive and accurate gene functional annotations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization and clustering of kinase isoform expression in metastatic melanoma</a></h4>

Mutations to the human kinome are known to play causal roles in cancer. The kinome regulates numerous cell processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition to aberrant expression, aberrant alternative splicing of cancer-driver genes is receiving increased attention as it could lead to loss or gain of functional domains, altering a kinase’s downstream impact. The present study quantifies changes in gene expression and isoform ratios in the kinome of metastatic melanoma cells relative to primary tumors. We contrast 538 total kinases and 3,040 known kinase isoforms between 103 primary tumor and 367 metastatic samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find strong evidence of differential expression (DE) at the gene level in 123 kinases (23%). Additionally, of the 468 kinases with alternative isoforms, 60 (13%) had significant difference in isoform ratios (DIR). Notably, DE and DIR have little correlation; for instance, although DE highlights enrichment in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), DIR identifies altered splicing in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Using exon junction mapping, we identify five examples of splicing events favored in metastatic samples. We demonstrate differential apoptosis and protein localization between <i>SLK</i> isoforms in metastatic melanoma. We cluster isoform expression data and identify subgroups that correlate with genomic subtypes and anatomic tumor locations. Notably, distinct DE and DIR patterns separate samples with <i>BRAF</i> hotspot mutations and <i>(N/K/H)RAS</i> hotspot mutations, the latter of which lacks effective kinase inhibitor treatments. DE in <i>RAS</i> mutants concentrates in CMGC kinases (a group including cell cycle and splicing regulators) rather than RTKs as in <i>BRAF</i> mutants. Furthermore, isoforms in the <i>RAS</i> kinase subgroup show enrichment for cancer-related processes such as angiogenesis and cell migration. Our results reveal a new approach to therapeutic target identification and demonstrate how different mutational subtypes may respond differently to treatments highlighting possible new driver events in cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrated computational and in vivo models reveal Key Insights into macrophage behavior during bone healing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Etienne Baratchart, Chen Hao Lo, Conor C. Lynch, David Basanta</p>

Myeloid-derived monocyte and macrophages are key cells in the bone that contribute to remodeling and injury repair. However, their temporal polarization status and control of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts responses is largely unknown. In this study, we focused on two aspects of monocyte/macrophage dynamics and polarization states over time: 1) the injury-triggered pro- and anti-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages temporal profiles, 2) the contributions of pro- versus anti-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in coordinating healing response. Bone healing is a complex multicellular dynamic process. While traditional <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimentation may capture the behavior of select populations with high resolution, they cannot simultaneously track the behavior of multiple populations. To address this, we have used an integrated coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based framework describing multiple cellular species to <i>in vivo</i> bone injury data in order to identify and test various hypotheses regarding bone cell populations dynamics. Our approach allowed us to infer several biological insights including, but not limited to,: 1) anti-inflammatory macrophages are key for early osteoclast inhibition and pro-inflammatory macrophage suppression, 2) pro-inflammatory macrophages are involved in osteoclast bone resorptive activity, whereas osteoblasts promote osteoclast differentiation, 3) Pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages rise during two expansion waves, which can be explained by the anti-inflammatory macrophages-mediated inhibition phase between the two waves. In addition, we further tested the robustness of the mathematical model by comparing simulation results to an independent experimental dataset. Taken together, this novel comprehensive mathematical framework allowed us to identify biological mechanisms that best recapitulate bone injury data and that explain the coupled cellular population dynamics involved in the process. Furthermore, our hypothesis testing methodology could be used in other contexts to decipher mechanisms in complex multicellular processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Feature blindness: A challenge for understanding and modelling visual object recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaurav Malhotra, Marin Dujmović, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Humans rely heavily on the shape of objects to recognise them. Recently, it has been argued that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can also show a shape-bias, provided their learning environment contains this bias. This has led to the proposal that CNNs provide good mechanistic models of shape-bias and, more generally, human visual processing. However, it is also possible that humans and CNNs show a shape-bias for very different reasons, namely, shape-bias in humans may be a consequence of architectural and cognitive constraints whereas CNNs show a shape-bias as a consequence of learning the statistics of the environment. We investigated this question by exploring shape-bias in humans and CNNs when they learn in a novel environment. We observed that, in this new environment, humans (i) focused on shape and overlooked many non-shape features, even when non-shape features were more diagnostic, (ii) learned based on only one out of multiple predictive features, and (iii) failed to learn when global features, such as shape, were absent. This behaviour contrasted with the predictions of a statistical inference model with no priors, showing the strong role that shape-bias plays in human feature selection. It also contrasted with CNNs that (i) preferred to categorise objects based on non-shape features, and (ii) increased reliance on these non-shape features as they became more predictive. This was the case even when the CNN was pre-trained to have a shape-bias and the convolutional backbone was frozen. These results suggest that shape-bias has a different source in humans and CNNs: while learning in CNNs is driven by the statistical properties of the environment, humans are highly constrained by their previous biases, which suggests that cognitive constraints play a key role in how humans learn to recognise novel objects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metacognition and mentalizing are associated with distinct neural representations of decision uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shaohan Jiang, Sidong Wang, Xiaohong Wan</p>

Metacognition and mentalizing are both associated with meta-level mental state representations. Conventionally, metacognition refers to monitoring one’s own cognitive processes, while mentalizing refers to monitoring others’ cognitive processes. However, this self-other dichotomy is insufficient to delineate the 2 high-level mental processes. We here used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to systematically investigate the neural representations of different levels of decision uncertainty in monitoring different targets (the current self, the past self [PS], and others) performing a perceptual decision-making task. Our results reveal diverse formats of internal mental state representations of decision uncertainty in mentalizing, separate from the associations with external cue information. External cue information was commonly represented in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) across the mentalizing tasks. However, the internal mental states of decision uncertainty attributed to others were uniquely represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), rather than the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) that also represented the object-level mental states of decision inaccuracy attributed to others. Further, the object-level and meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty, when attributed to the PS, were represented in the precuneus and the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), respectively. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) represented currently experienced decision uncertainty in metacognition, and also uncertainty about the estimated decision uncertainty (estimate uncertainty), but not the estimated decision uncertainty per se in mentalizing. Hence, our findings identify neural signatures to clearly delineate metacognition and mentalizing and further imply distinct neural computations on internal mental states of decision uncertainty during metacognition and mentalizing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Delayed treatment of tuberculosis of the elbow joint [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is known to occur in the musculoskeletal system, including the elbow joints. These cases are rarely found because the signs and symptoms are not specific to extrapulmonary TB or other diseases. We report a case of a 24-year-old male, who complained about pain in his left elbow and noticed swelling. Initially, he complained about pain all over his left arm, after several reflexology massages to alleviate his toothache. However, instead of seeking medical treatment, he visited a traditional massage therapist every week without improvement in his left arm pain including his left elbow for almost one year. Examination showed skin perforation with discharge. He also had fever during the first few days when the elbow became swollen. Weight loss and a decreased appetite were also noticed by the patient. The patient went to the orthopedic department and underwent surgery. Radiological examination indicated bone erosion on the left humerus and radius, while posteroanterior chest X-ray did not show any abnormality. Histopathological examinations from biopsy and fluid aspiration showed granulomas and datia Langhans cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found on acid-fast bacteria smear and culture. The patient was administered multidrug tuberculosis therapy, which consisted of two months of an intensive phase and seven months of a continuation phase, in accordance with the World Health Organization’s guidelines for extrapulmonary tuberculosis treatment. He has currently undergone the continuation phase of the treatment and his condition has improved. Early detection of tuberculosis of the elbow can prevent damage to joint structure and impairment of joint function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Internet addiction during COVID-19 restricted movement period: A cross-sectional study from Bangladesh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The restricted movement period related to COVID-19 has presumably contributed to the deterioration of the Internet addiction crisis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of Internet addiction and identify the factors associated with the increase in severity of Internet addiction among the general population of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 related restricted movement period. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Bangladesh from September 20 to October 5, 2020, and 315 Bangladeshi adults were included in the study. We used Young’s Internet Addiction Scale to assess the prevalence of Internet addiction and identified the factors associated with the increase in severity of Internet addiction during the restricted movement period using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The overall prevalence of Internet addiction was 39.7% among the general population of Bangladesh during the restricted movement period. Almost 75% of the respondents reported increased time spent on recreational use of the Internet during the period of interest, and 48.5% of the respondents reported increases in the severity of Internet addiction. In logistic regression analyses, the increase in severity of Internet addiction was found to be significantly associated with social class, occupation, sleeping hours, and increased time spent on recreational use of the internet (p < 0.05). Watching movies/series was the main activity of the respondents during the restricted movement period. Conclusion: Our study reported an increase in the prevalence of Internet addiction among the general population of Bangladesh during the restricted movement period. Social class, occupation, sleeping hours, and increased time spent on recreational use were the significant determinants of the increase in severity of Internet addiction. The policymakers should undertake tailored policies to prevent people from being victims of the consequences of psychological issues in the long run.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DeepReGraph co-clusters temporal gene expression and cis-regulatory elements through heterogeneous graph representation learning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This work presents DeepReGraph, a novel method for co-clustering genes and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) into candidate regulatory networks. Gene expression data, as well as data from three CRE activity markers from a publicly available dataset of mouse fetal heart tissue, were used for DeepReGraph concept proofing. In this study we used open chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq experiments, as well as H3K27ac and H3K27me3 histone marks as CREs activity markers. However, this method can be executed with other sets of markers. We modelled all data sources as a heterogeneous graph and adapted a state-of-the-art representation learning algorithm to produce a low-dimensional and easy-to-cluster embedding of genes and CREs. Deep graph auto-encoders and an adaptive-sparsity generative model are the algorithmic core of DeepReGraph. The main contribution of our work is the design of proper combination rules for the heterogeneous gene expression and CRE activity data and the computational encoding of well-known gene expression regulatory mechanisms into a suitable objective function for graph embedding. We showed that the co-clusters of genes and CREs in the final embedding shed light on developmental regulatory mechanisms in mouse fetal-heart tissue. Such clustering could not be achieved by using only gene expression data. Function enrichment analysis proves that the genes in the co-clusters are involved in distinct biological processes. The enriched transcription factor binding sites in CREs prioritize the candidate transcript factors which drive the temporal changes in gene expression. Consequently, we conclude that DeepReGraph could foster hypothesis-driven tissue development research from high-throughput expression and epigenomic data. Full source code and data are available on the DeepReGraph GitHub project.

                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the older population. In this work, we have developed a formulation of orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) containing Centella asiatica (CA) encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with rapid disintegration and dissolution, thereby providing greater convenience and ease of use to older patients with PD or dysphagia. Methods: The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of CA compounds were evaluated using QikProp module of Schrödinger. CA-SLNs were prepared using hot homogenization method. The physicochemical properties and quality control of the pre-compressed powder were characterized. The direct compression method was used to prepare ODTs, and post-compression physical properties were evaluated. Results: In silico study of ADMET properties revealed the CA compounds can follow the criteria for an orally active drug and are within the standard range in terms of "Rule of Five" and "Rule of Three”. The characteristics of CA-SLNs developed in a lipid-based nanocarrier showed monodispersed particles with an average particle size of about 37.91±1.55 nm, zeta potential of -10.27±1.37 mV, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity of 95.07±1.14%, and 3.99±0.06%, respectively. The results obtained for the pre-compression characterization showed that the CA-SLNs powder mixture had excellent flowability properties and compressibility. Furthermore, these results affected the physical properties of CA-SLNs ODTs with a disintegration time of 14.5s, the acceptance value of content uniformity was 3.2%, and the in vitro dissolution test fulfilled the tolerance limits recommended in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that CA-SLNs ODTs developed with lipid-based nanocarriers can be considered an alternative delivery system to protect the active compound from instability while enhancing permeability through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and can be used in the management of PD in older patients with dysphagia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies of promoting sustainable use and conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Zambia: lessons from low-income countries [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for conservation and use of village or indigenous chickens (IC) ( Gallus domesticus) in Zambia with lessons in  Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Small scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households’ nutritional needs, incomes, social-cultural and religious uses. The commitment exhibited by SSF to keeping indigenous animals has made them the major custodians of essential animal genetic resources in most low-income regions. Between 1991 and 2012, private breeders invested over US$95 million in Zambia’s commercial poultry sector resulting in over 100% increase in the annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production costs and low market access hindered the participation of rural farmers hence their continued dependence on IC breeds. The future of IC genetic resources is threatened due to their rapid erosion. In the 2015 biodiversity status report, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nations highlighted that over 3.5% of chicken breeds were extinct, nearly 33% were at high risk, and over 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use have significantly contributed to these losses. For example, in 2012, 60% of village chickens were reportedly diseased in parts of SSA. If these challenges are not mitigated, the loss of IC genetic resources and the adverse impact on rural communities is inevitable. Further, future research and breeding programs on commercial chickens may be limited due to the erosion of IC genetic resources. This paper reviews lessons and contributes to previous studies that demonstrated how community-based breeding programs and researcher-community-stakeholder engagements potentially enhanced sustainability, adoption of innovative ideas and conservation of local animal genetic resources in selected low-income countries. Further, suggest strategies to promote judicious use and conservation of IC breeds in Zambia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter metabolomics signature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Incentives for pregnant mothers during antenatal care for better maternal and neonatal health outcomes in low and middle income countries: A systematic review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Universal access to maternal new-born and child healthcare services (MNCH) is detrimental for attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) three pertaining to promotion of health at all ages. Incentivization in the form of cash, vouchers, and goods have been used as part of strategies to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes around the world. However, there exists uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of various incentive-based programmes targeted for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries during their antenatal period. Methods: We will search six electronic databases, namely the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase in addition to Google Scholar. Manual searching of the reference lists of included studies will also be done. The reporting of this protocol will follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement [29]. Only interventional studies that follow randomized, quasi randomized, and cluster randomized controlled study designs will be included. A three-stage screening process will be adopted to select articles. Risk of bias for the included studies will be assessed using the tools and criteria specified in the Cochrane handbook. In addition, the GRADE approach will be used to assess the quality of evidence for the maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Conclusion: This review of trials is essential to inform the effectiveness of incentive-based programmes targeted for pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries. It will help the policy makers to utilise the resources more effectively and to integrate the evidence based public health initiatives into the health system. This can also help build the continuum of care financial packages for all pregnant women.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the rates of neurological events following administration of mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus vector (Janssen) vaccines in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used publicly available data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collected between January 1, 2021 and June 14, 2021. All free text symptoms that were reported within 42 days of vaccine administration were manually reviewed and grouped into 36 individual neurological diagnostic categories. Post-vaccination neurological event rates were compared between vaccine types and to age-matched baseline incidence rates in the U.S. and rates of neurological events following COVID.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 306,907,697 COVID vaccine doses administered during the study timeframe, 314,610 (0.1%) people reported any adverse event and 105,214 (0.03%) reported neurological adverse events in a median of 1 day (IQR0-3) from inoculation. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurred in fewer than 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Significantly more neurological adverse events were reported following Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination compared to either Pfizer-BioNtech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1,273; 0.15% vs 0.03% vs 0.03% of doses, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The observed-to-expected ratios for GBS, CVT and seizure following Janssen vaccination were ≥1.5-fold higher than background rates. However, the rate of neurological events after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reports of serious neurological events following COVID vaccination are rare. GBS, CVT and seizure may occur at higher than background rates following Janssen vaccination. Despite this, rates of neurological complications following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:756–771</p>

Following the third vaccine dose, patients who are low or nonresponders following initial vaccination did not increase antibody titers. In healthy controls and ocrelizumab-treated pwMS, cellular response decreased 6 months after initial vaccination and increased significantly after the third dose.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The encephalitis associated with antibodies against contactin-associated proteinlike 2 (CASPR2) is presumably antibody-mediated, but the antibody effects and whether they cause behavioral alterations are not well known. Here, we used a mouse model of patients' immunoglobulin G (IgG) transfer and super-resolution microscopy to demonstrate the antibody pathogenicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis or healthy controls was infused into the cerebroventricular system of mice. The levels and colocalization of CASPR2 with transient axonal glycoprotein 1 (TAG1) were determined with stimulated emission depletion microscopy (40–70μm lateral resolution). Hippocampal clusters of Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) and GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) were quantified with confocal microscopy. Behavioral alterations were assessed with standard behavioral paradigms. Cultured neurons were used to determine the levels of intracellular CASPR2 and TAG1 after exposure to patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Infusion of patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, caused memory impairment along with hippocampal reduction of surface CASPR2 clusters and decreased CASPR2/TAG1 colocalization. In cultured neurons, patients' IgG led to an increase of intracellular CASPR2 without affecting TAG1, suggesting selective CASPR2 internalization. Additionally, mice infused with patients' IgG showed decreased levels of Kv1.1 and GluA1 (two CASPR2-regulated proteins). All these alterations and the memory deficit reverted to normal after removing patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis causes reversible memory impairment, inhibits the interaction of CASPR2/TAG1, and decreases the levels of CASPR2 and related proteins (VGKC, AMPAR). These findings fulfill the postulates of antibody-mediated disease and provide a biological basis for antibody-removing treatment approaches. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:801–813</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this paper was to explore the utility of time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>)-based target mismatch on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with AIS underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using T<sub>max</sub> thresholds &gt;9.5 seconds and &gt;16 seconds, respectively. The difference between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes and the ratio between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and T<sub>max</sub> mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast computed tomography (CT) at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal T<sub>max</sub> volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all T<sub>max</sub> parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596 <i>p</i> &lt;0.001) and good outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per 1 ml increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume of ≤67 ml best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91 and specificity = 0.73).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>T<sub>max</sub> target mismatch predicts radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with AIS with LVO receiving EVT within 24 hours from onset. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:878–888</p>

<p>We addressed this issue using two complementary systems: (1) human skin from patients with diabetic neuropathy and to (2) a coculture model of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in the context of intrinsic neuronal factor and extrinsic microenvironmental collagen and its biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In diabetic neuropathy, the skin innervation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFd), a measure of sensory nerve degeneration, was reduced with similar expression of a growth associated protein 43, a marker of nerve regeneration. In contrast, the content and packing of collagen in the diabetic skin became more rigid than the control skin. Sec31a, a protein that regulates the collagen biosynthetic pathway, was upregulated and inversely correlated with IENFd. In the cell model, activated HDFs exposed to high-glucose medium enhanced the expression of Sec31a and collagen I through the activation of transforming growth factor β, a profibrotic molecule. Sec31a upregulation impaired neurite outgrowth. This effect was reversed by silencing Sec31a expression and neurite outgrowth was resumed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The current study provides evidence that Sec31a plays a key role in inhibiting nerve regeneration in diabetic neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:821–833</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Greater Diffusion Restriction in White Matter in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer's continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition, which at the earliest stages is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes is characterized is relatively underexplored. The goal of this study was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45 to 85 years completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid positron emission tomography (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta-amyloid-negative (AB−) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (ie, fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], mean kurtosis) and modeling (ie, axonal water fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB− (partial <i>η</i>
<sup>2</sup> =0.08–0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (area under the curve = 0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a nonmonotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.

                <p><i>APOE</i> is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A specific conformation of the ApoE protein is present in amyloid-β (Aβ) containing plaques. Immunotherapy targeting ApoE in plaques reduces brain Aβ deposits in mice. Here, we evaluated the effects of the anti-human APOE antibody HAE-4 on amyloid plaques, Aβ-mediated tau seeding and spreading, and neuritic dystrophy in the 5XFAD amyloid mice expressing human ApoE4. HAE-4 reduced Aβ plaques as well as Aβ-driven tau seeding/spreading and neuritic dystrophy. These results demonstrate that HAE-4 may provide therapeutic effects on amyloid removal and Aβ driven downstream consequences such as tauopathy. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:847–852</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:772–781</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine Consumption and Dementia: Are Lewy Bodies the Link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ years from the UK Biobank (UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy bodies, and vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100 mg/day, caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with a significantly higher HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03–1.76) and AD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.85) dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100 mg/day, the HRs (95% CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100 ≤ 200, 200 ≤ 300, 300 ≤ 400, and &gt; 400 mg/day were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.72–0.94), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79–1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies (odds ratio (95%CI): 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21–0.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:834–846</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with MS aged 18 to 60 years were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between January 6, 2021, and July 21, 2021, 389 patients with MS were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% women; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR)—40%; natalizumab —17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators −12%; and 15% untreated. One hundred seventy-seven patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, and 47 were asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared with other groups (<i>p</i> ≤0.0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ) were decreased in S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.03), increased in natalizumab (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and non-OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> &lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMTs had differential effects on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune responses did not correlate with COVID-19 clinical severity in this relatively young and nondisabled group of patients with MS. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:782–795</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M synthesis (IgM<sub>Intrathecal Fraction (IF)</sub>
<sup>+</sup>) and spinal MRI lesions are both strong independent predictors of higher disease activity and severity in multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated whether IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> is associated with spinal cord manifestation and higher neuroaxonal damage in early MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 122 patients with a first demyelinating event associations between (1) spinal versus (vs) non-spinal clinical syndrome (2) spinal vs cerebral T2-weighted (T2w) and (3) contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion counts with IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) or IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) were investigated by logistic regression adjusted for age and sex, respectively. For serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) analysis patients were categorized for presence or absence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB), IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub> (&gt;0% vs 0%, respectively): (1) OCGB<sup>−</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (2) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (3) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; and (4) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>. Associations between categories 2 to 4 vs category 1 with sNfL concentrations were analyzed by robust linear regression, adjusted for sex and MRI parameters.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with a spinal syndrome had a 8.36-fold higher odds of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (95%CI 3.03–23.03; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Each spinal T2w lesion (odds Ratio 1.39; 1.02–1.90; <i>p</i> = 0.037) and CE lesion (OR 2.73; 1.22–6.09; <i>p</i> = 0.014) was associated with an increased risk of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (but not of IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>); this was not the case for cerebral lesions. OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> category patients showed highest sNfL levels (estimate:1.80; 0.55–3.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intrathecal IgM synthesis is strongly associated with spinal manifestation and independently more pronounced neuroaxonal injury in early MS, suggesting a distinct clinical phenotype and pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:814–820</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to determine the pattern of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) related to postmortem Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology in clinical Alzheimer disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>FDG-PET scans were analyzed in 62 autopsy-confirmed patients and 110 controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on neuropathologic evaluations on Braak stage for neurofibrillary tangle, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD score for neuritic plaque, and Lewy-related pathology, subjects were classified into AD(−)/LBD(−), AD(−)/LBD(+), AD(+)/LBD(−), and AD(+)/LBD(+) groups. The association between postmortem LBD and AD pathologies and antemortem brain metabolism was evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD and LBD pathologies had significant interaction effects to decrease metabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral caudate, putamen, basal frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to the left side of the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, and significant interaction effects to increase metabolism in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal frontal cortex, corresponding to the Lewy body-related hypermetabolic patterns. AD pathology was associated with hypometabolism in the bilateral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex regardless of LBD pathology, whereas LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen and anterior cingulate cortex regardless of AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postmortem LBD and AD pathologies had significant interaction effects on the antemortem brain metabolism in clinical AD patients. Specific metabolic patterns related to AD and LBD pathologies could be elucidated when simultaneously considering the two pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:853–863</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Reassessing synaptic adhesion pathways</a></h4>

              
                Multiple synaptic adhesion proteins are thought to collectively define the properties of specific synapses and thereby shape the architectures of neural circuits. Growing evidence supports a molecular model in which a set of central hub proteins interacts with a vast number of other proteins to organize multifarious synaptic adhesion pathways. However, several fundamental open questions remain, partly owing to drawbacks in current approaches and interpretations. In this opinion, we provide an overview of synaptic adhesion pathways, underscoring open questions to be addressed in future work, and highlighting approaches for advancing understanding of synaptic adhesion processes.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Functional interplay between central and autonomic nervous systems in human fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Historically, studies on the neural basis of fear conditioning have emphasized the role of the central nervous system. However, there is growing evidence for the role of the autonomic nervous system in human fear conditioning. Here, we provide an overview of the sophisticated anatomical–functional interplay between the prefrontal cortex and heart-related dynamics in human fear conditioning and propose a theoretical model to conceptualize these psychophysiological processes, the neurovisceral integration model of fear (NVI-f).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current">Microbial functional changes mark irreversible course of Tibetan grassland degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 13 May 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30047-7">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-30047-7</a></p>The Tibetan Kobresia pastures store 2.5% of the world’s soil organic carbon. Here the authors show that soil degradation and microbial shifts may irreversibly diminish the carbon sink function and accelerate nutrient losses.
