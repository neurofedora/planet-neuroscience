                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This manuscript covers my personal history on the search for the neural circuits supporting early developing memory in primates. A series of developmental neuropsychological studies is presented to follow the successive knowledge we gained over several decades on the timing of development of the hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent recognition memory functions in primates. The borrowing of an incidental recognition memory task measuring novelty preference to infer subjects' memory was central to assessing memory in young infant monkeys of only a few weeks old. Data revealed that the emergence of adult-like proficiency in visual recognition and spatial memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction is a stepwise process. This progressive development was associated with the gradual maturation of different hippocampal intrinsic circuits (Entorhinal-CA1 and Entorhinal-Dentate Gyrus-CA fields) and their connections with other cortical structures (the perirhinal, parahippocampal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices). We also showed that a similar postnatal maturation of hippocampal-dependent memory is observed in human infants, suggesting important changes in the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal cortical areas in human memory development as well.</p>

<p>We used tract tracing and in vivo physiology to investigate auditory processing in the brainstem of the Tokay gecko. We found conserved patterns of connection in higher-order auditory nuclei and an apparent lack of tonotopy at the level of the auditory midbrain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In reptiles, two taxa, lepidosaurs and archosaurs, have ears with thin tympanic membranes that permit sensitive hearing of high-frequency sounds in air. The organization of their central auditory systems may reflect this increased sensitivity to sound. To understand auditory processing in lepidosaurs further, we used tract tracing techniques to examine the organization and connections of the lemniscal and midbrain auditory nuclei in the Tokay gecko. The nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LLD) consist of anterior (LLDa), medial (LLDm), and posterior (LLDp) subdivisions and receive ascending projections from the contralateral cochlear nuclei (nucleus angularis and nucleus laminaris) and the ipsilateral dorsal superior olive (SOd). LLD projects to the ventral division of the ipsilateral torus semicircularis (TS). In the Tokay gecko, the central nucleus of the torus (TSC) is large, with two major subdivisions, ventral and dorsal. Caudally, the TSC is fused at the midline, with the dorsal divisions adjoining their contralateral homolog. More rostrally, the TSC bifurcates to form two wings below the tectal ventricles. The ventral division of the TSC receives ascending input from NA/NL, SOd, and the lateral lemniscal complex, while both the dorsal and ventral divisions send descending projections to the lateral lemniscal complex. The TSC projects to the auditory thalamic nucleus medialis through the tractus opticus lateralis. Physiological recordings from TSCv injection sites revealed a patchy distribution of best frequencies, while recordings in TSCd were characterized by broad frequency tuning. The tract tracing results revealed conserved anatomical patterns of ascending auditory connections in lizards and archosaurs.</p>

     alt="Head Color Morph- and Sex-Specific Differences in Follistatin Gene Expression in the Gouldian Finch Brain"/>
<p>Using highly sensitive and specific RNAscope in situ hybridization, we revealed that black-headed morphs displayed higher follistatin (<i>FST</i>) mRNA levels across multiple brain regions associated with aggression, stress responses, and parental care compared to red-headed morphs. Males consistently showed greater <i>FST</i> mRNA levels within the same morph type than females. These findings suggest that head color morph- and sex-specific differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression may underlie the observed morph- and sex-specific differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care in Gouldian finches.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The Gouldian finch exhibits a head color polymorphism, which is tightly coupled to distinct differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care. In competitive environments, red-headed birds are more aggressive, are less parental, and exhibit a heightened stress response relative to black-headed birds. The head color polymorphism has been associated with genetic variation in a small noncoding region near the follistatin (<i>FST</i>) gene. Given the regulatory nature of this gene, we hypothesized that <i>FST</i> mRNA would be differentially expressed in association with morph- and sex-specific differences in the brains of red- and black-headed morphs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed <i>FST</i> gene expression in the Gouldian finch brain using RNAscope in situ hybridization assay. Our results revealed significant differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression between morphs and sex. Specifically, black-headed morphs, regardless of sex, displayed higher <i>FST</i> mRNA levels across multiple brain regions associated with aggression, stress responses, and parental care compared to red-headed morphs. Furthermore, males consistently showed greater <i>FST</i> mRNA levels within the same morph type than females. These findings suggest that head color morph- and sex-specific differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression may underlie the observed morph- and sex-specific differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care in Gouldian finches.</p>

                Neural processing is often categorized as externally or internally focused. Though commonly treated as poles of a single dimension, we delineate how the terms ‘external’ and ‘internal’ refer to independent concepts at the levels of cognitive modes, representational contents, and sensory origins. Separating these levels brings theoretical clarity and opens unexplored questions.

">A genetically-defined population of amygdalofugal neurons promotes suckling and early postnatal growth</a></h4>

              
                Suckling by newborns is an instinctive behavior defining the mammalian class. Yet, due to experimental difficulty in assessing neural function in the very young, little is known about the neural control of this fundamental behavior. Here we develop molecular-genetic approaches to interrogate neuronal connectivity and function in newborn mice and used these tools to identify a population of pro-dynorphin (PDYN) and somatostatin (SST) expressing neurons in the central amygdala that are activated during suckling. CeA PDYN+SST+ neurons connect with brainstem areas mediating oral sensorimotor and reward function in adults, and their ablation in newborns decreases suckling vigor and impairs growth. These results uncover the crucial role of a specific neuronal population of the central amygdala in maintaining the infants propensity to suckle and thrive throughout infancy.

                Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional cytoplasmic adaptor protein implicated in maintaining neuronal homeostasis through its roles in selective autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of inflammatory signaling. Mutations in the OPTN gene are causally linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary open-angle glaucoma. Here we have eight optineurin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1032/v2?src=rss">Between Protection and Destruction: The Legal Tension Between Military Necessity and Cultural Heritage Protection in International Humanitarian Law [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-833/v3?src=rss">The Influence of Demographic Characteristics on Academic Staff Performance in Private Chartered Universities in western Uganda [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic staff performance plays a critical role in the success of higher education institutions. In Uganda’s private university sector, understanding how demographic characteristics affect academic staff performance can inform more equitable and effective human resource practices. This study investigated the extent to which demographic factors influence academic performance among academic staff in private universities in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used, involving 386 academic staff members from selected private universities. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlation to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level, position, years of teaching experience, and field of specialty) and indicators of academic performance. Results The analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations. The highest level of education attained was positively associated with years of teaching experience (r = .504, p < .01) and academic position (r = .619, p < .01). Years of teaching experience also showed a positive correlation with academic performance (r = .230, p < .01). Gender exhibited a weak but significant negative relationship with education level (r = –.123, p < .05) and teaching experience (r = –.115, p < .05), suggesting gender-related disparities in academic progression. Additionally, age group correlated moderately with education level (r = .292, p < .01) and academic position (r = .295, p < .01), reflecting career advancement over time. Beyond these statistical associations, the findings show that demographic characteristics such as gender, qualifications, academic rank, and field of specialty actively shape academic staff performance through access to opportunities, research engagement, and teaching responsibilities. Conclusions The study demonstrates that demographic factors particularly education level, experience, and academic rank significantly influence academic staff performance in private universities in Uganda. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop staff management and development policies that account for demographic diversity. Tailored interventions in recruitment, promotion, and retention can enhance institutional effectiveness and equity in academic staff development.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is an extremely rare histiocytic neoplasm with a highly variable and often unpredictable clinical course and prognosis. Multiple organs can be affected mimicking other systemic diseases both clinically and radiologically. This makes timely diagnosis more challenging. Case Presentation We report the case of a 39-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of fever and retrosternal chest pain. Ha has a long history of diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism of unknown aetiology. On exploration, computed tomography revealed retroperitoneal fibrosis and “hairy” kidney appearance. Subsequent multimodality imaging studies showed the extensive multisystemic involvement including the skeletal system, retroperitoneum, pituitary, retroperitoneum, kidneys, heart, central nervous system, myocardium, pleura, lymph nodes and GI tract. Histopathology confirmed CD68+/CD1a- histiocytosis. Molecular analysis for BRAF mutation is currently pending. Pegylated interferon α and corticosteroids induced rapid clinical and biochemical improvement. Therapeutic response using a follow-up 18F-FDG PET scan revealed subsequent improved systemic lesions. Conclusion A prolonged history of unexplained endocrine abnormalities in the context of fever of unknown origin should evoke the diagnosis of ECD. Multimodal imaging is essential for diagnosis and for monitoring treatment response. This case highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical evaluation, histological analysis, and imaging studies for the optimal the management of this disease. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy can lead to better outcomes, even prior to confirmation of molecular findings.

                Background The photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is a common but underexplored phenomenon where bright light triggers sneezing, affecting ~30% of the population. This study aimed to characterise the light conditions inducing PSR. Methods One male PSR-affected participant logged sneezing events during a 30-day real-world light exposure study. An indoor setup using a multi-primary LED source and an integrating sphere delivered 30-second light stimuli while pupillometric data were collected. Results A total of 82 sneezing events were recorded, averaging 2.73 sneezes/day (range: 1–6 per event). Illuminance increased tenfold before sneezing, peaking 2 minutes prior, and returned to baseline within 10 minutes. Despite exposure to 150+ stimuli, artificial sneezing was not induced, though high illuminance consistently triggered tickling sensations. Conclusions Sudden increases in environmental lighting can provoke PSR. While artificial stimuli elicited only tickling, further refinement of the protocol could enable reliable PSR induction, thereby facilitating mechanistic research.

                Background Three-dimensional (3D) food printing is an emerging technology with potential applications in personalized nutrition and sustainable food production. However, its success hinges critically on consumer acceptance, which is predominantly determined by the sensory properties of the printed products. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature on the sensory evaluation of 3D-printed foods was needed. Objective This systematic review aimed to map and critically analyse the current state of knowledge on the sensory properties of 3D-printed foods, the methodologies used for their evaluation, and the relationship between printing parameters, material properties, and sensory perception. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, resulting in the inclusion and analysis of 65 relevant scientific studies. Results The field is experiencing exponential growth, with research focused on chocolate, meat products, and purees, often printed as simple geometric shapes for controlled study. Sensory evaluation relies heavily on affective (hedonic) and descriptive methods (e.g., QDA). A strong link exists between the rheological and textural properties of the food inks ("printability") and the sensory attributes of the final product ("liking or acceptability"). Key challenges include the limited use of existing sensory methods and the need to explore sustainable ingredients. Conclusion The future of the field lies in integrating material science with sensory science to create customized, nutritious, and appealing foods. The application of different sensory methods according to the study objective and further research into the dynamics of oral processing are essential for progress.

                <p>by G.V.T. Swapna, Namita Dube, Monica J. Roth, Gaetano T. Montelione</p>

The Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamily of integral membrane proteins transport a wide array of small molecules across plasma and organelle membranes, and function as important drug transporters and as viral receptors. They populate different conformational states during the solute transport process, including outward-open, intermediate (occluded), and inward-open conformational states. For some SLC proteins this structural “flipping” corresponds to swapping between conformations of their N-terminal and C-terminal symmetry-related sub-structures. Conventional AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3, or Evolutionary Scale Modeling methods typically generate models for only one of these multiple conformational states of SLC proteins. While several AI-based protocols for modeling multiple conformational states of proteins have been described recently, these methods are often impacted by “memorization” of one of the alternative conformational states, and do not always provide both the inward- and outward-open conformations of SLC proteins. Here we assess the impact of memorization in modeling SLC proteins with AlphaFold2/3, and describe a combined ESM – template-based-modeling process, based on a previously described template-based modeling method that relies on the internal pseudo-symmetry of many SLC proteins, to consistently model the alternate conformational states of SLC proteins. We also demonstrate how the resulting multi-state models can be validated by comparison with sequence-based evolutionary co-variance data (ECs) that encode information about contacts present in the various conformational states adopted by the protein. This simple, rapid, and robust approach for modeling conformational landscapes of pseudo-symmetric SLC proteins is demonstrated for several integral membrane protein transporters, including SLC35F2 the receptor of a feline leukemia virus envelope protein required for viral entry into eukaryotic cells.

                <p>by Elena Lara-Simon, Juan Domingo Gispert, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Pablo Villoslada, for the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative </p>

Alzheimer’s disease encompasses multiple biological scales, spanning molecular factors, cells, tissues, and behavioral manifestations. The interplay among these scales in shaping the clinical phenotype is not yet fully comprehended. In particular, there is great interest in understanding the heterogeneity of the clinical aspects of AD in order to improve treatment and prevention, by targeting those aspects most susceptible to the disease. Here we employed a systems biology approach to address this issue, utilizing multilayer network analysis and deep phenotyping. This integrative analysis incorporated genomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, tau and amyloid beta (A<i>β</i>) PET imaging, brain MRI data, risk factors, and clinical information (cognitive tests scores, Clinical Dementia Rating and clinical diagnosis) obtained through the ADNI collaboration. Multilayer networks were built based on mutual information between the elements of each layer and between layers. Boolean simulations allowed us to identify paths that transmit dynamic information across layers. The most prominent path for predicting variables in the cognitive phenotype layer included the PET radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the posterior cingulate. Combinations of different symptomatic variables, mainly related to mental health (depression, mood swings, drowsiness) and vascular features (hypertension, cardiovascular history), were also part of the paths explaining the average phenotype. Our results show that integrating the flow of information across biological scales reveals relevant paths for AD, which can be subsequently explored as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In particular, our results point for paths related with brain hypometabolism as a key feature in AD.

                <p>by Sandesh Acharya, Pathum Kossinna, Qingrun Zhang, Jiami Guo</p>

With the rapid emergence of single-cell transcriptomics datasets, reproducible marker genes and functional annotation of cell type or state is becoming increasingly important. Conventional methods that rely on differential gene expression (DEG) analysis lack both consistency across datasets and functional annotations of selected markers. Here, we present scSCOPE, an R-based platform that utilizes stabilized LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) feature selection, bootstrapped co-expression networks, and pathway enrichments to identify reproducible and functionally relevant marker genes and associated pathways in scRNAseq datasets. Using 9 scRNAseq datasets from human and mouse immune cells generated by different sequencing technologies, we show that scSCOPE outperforms other conventional methods by automatically identifying cell type-specific marker genes and pathways with the highest consistency across all datasets. scSCOPE’s gene co-expression and pathway analyses also provide in-depth molecular insights into the functionality of identified marker genes. We anticipate that scSCOPE will greatly improve cell type annotation and accelerate the design of experimental validation and functional investigations on cell heterogeneity.

                <p>by Clara T. Friedman, Minqi Wang, Thomas Yerxa, Bryce A. Arseneau, Xin Huang, Emily A. Cooper</p>

Differentiating objects, people, and animals from their surroundings is a key visual function, referred to as figure-ground segregation. Psychological research has established that humans use diverse visual features such as shape, texture, motion, and distance to identify figures. However, our understanding of the neural computations supporting figure-ground segregation remains incomplete. Recent neurophysiological observations in cortical area MT of primates – a region important for motion and depth processing – suggest that neurons in this area <i>favor</i> visual features that intuitively map onto figures, such as faster motion and closer distances. Inspired by these new observations, here we test the hypothesis that figures in natural scenes contain statistical regularities in motion and distance detectable at the scale of neuronal receptive fields. We combined statistical measurements of motion and distance from natural scenes with figure-ground annotations and simulations of receptive field inputs. Within simulated receptive fields, inputs corresponding to figures tended to move faster and more coherently, and tended to be nearer in distance, than the nearby ground. Our simulation predicts that the statistical regularities associated with figure motion increase notably with retinal eccentricity, while the distance statistics do not. Lastly, we implemented a simple neural population model illustrating how MT response properties, in combination with these statistics, can prioritize the representation of visual features associated with figures. These results enrich our understanding of the computations supporting figure-ground segregation, provide a normative account for recent neurophysiological observations, and contribute to converging lines of evidence that the brain exploits natural statistics to prioritize behaviorally-relevant information.

                <p>by Xikeng Liang, Shutong Xiao, Lu Ba, Yuhui Feng, Zhicheng Ma, Fatima Adilova, Jing Qi, Shuilin Jin</p>

Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly developing field of single-cell genomics that quantitatively measures gene expression while providing spatial information within tissues. A key challenge in spatial transcriptomics is identifying spatially structured domains, which involves analyzing transcriptomic data to find clusters of cells with similar expression patterns and their spatial distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning method called DMGCN for domain identification. The process begins with preprocessing that constructs two types of graphs: a spatial graph based on Euclidean distance and a feature graph based on Cosine distance. These graphs represent spatial positions and gene expressions, respectively. The embeddings of both graphs are generated using a multi-view graph convolutional encoder with an attention mechanism, enabling separate and co-convolution of the graphs, as well as corrupted feature convolution for contrastive learning. Finally, a fully connected network (FCN) decoder is employed to generate domain labels and reconstruct gene expressions for downstream analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DMGCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including spatial clustering, trajectory inference, and gene expression broadcasting.

                <p>by Ci Fu, Emily H. Xiong, Livia Kupczok, Linda S. Archambault, Timothy R. W. Wang, Caitlin Holleran, Duncan Carruthers-Lay, Ting Xuan Zhuang, Sofia Marcoccia, Haoyang Zhang, Kevin Chen, Daniel Anderson, Bonnie Yiu, Zhongle Liu, Lydia Herzel, Nicole Robbins, Leah E. Cowen</p>

A small percentage of species in the fungal kingdom can cause devastating infections in humans, with <i>Candida albicans</i> reigning as a leading cause of systemic disease. One of the key virulence phenotypes for pathogenic fungi is the ability to survive at host body temperature; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate thermal adaptation in fungi remains incomplete. In this study, we expand the largest functional genomics resource in <i>C. albicans,</i> reaching 71.3% coverage of the entire genome, and perform screens under six different temperatures to identify genes important for temperature-dependent fitness. We describe the function of genes involved in translation (<i>GAR1</i>), splicing (<i>C1_11680C</i> or <i>YSF3</i>), and cell cycle progression (<i>C6_00110C</i> or <i>RHT1</i>) in enabling fungal survival at both low and high temperatures. Through experimental evolution, we also show that <i>C. albicans</i> can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations and adapt to extreme temperature environments. Overall, our study highlights the transformative potential of genome-wide functional genomics to uncover critical vulnerabilities in pathogenic fungi.

                Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is linked to cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive motor dual-task blindfold training (CMDBT) may enhance cognition by engaging procedural memory centers. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CMDBT combined with aerobic and resistance exercises on cognitive function in individuals with T2DM. Methods A single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention assessments was conducted. Sixty two adults with T2DM were randomly allocated to an experimental group (CMDBT plus moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training; n = 31) or a control group (aerobic and resistance training only; n = 31). Both groups trained three times per week for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Results Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups (all p > 0.05). After 12 weeks, the experimental group showed a mean MoCA increase of 3.32 ± 1.74 to 29.13 ± 0.76 (p < 0.0001), exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 2.3 points, whereas the control group improved by 0.94 points (25.77 ± 1.45 to 26.71 ± 1.37; p = 0.0006). The adjusted between-group difference was 2.38 points (p = 0.0001), demonstrating a significantly greater cognitive benefit with CMDBT. Conclusion CMDBT combined with conventional exercises is more effective than CMDT or conventional therapy alone in enhancing cognition and in T2DM, supporting its integration into rehabilitation programs.

                Neuromarketing has emerged as a rigorous interdisciplinary paradigm for probing the latent dimensions of consumer behaviour. Through synthesizing insights from cognitive science with advanced neurophysiological methodologies, it elucidates the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying decision- making process, thereby offering a nuanced extension to contemporary marketing theory.Through non-invasive techniques such as Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Electromyography, biometric sensors, and implicit association tests, researchers can investigate how emotion, memory, and sensory inputs shape purchasing behaviour. As interest in the neural underpinnings of consumer choice continues to grow, neuromarketing has emerged as a dynamic and evolving field. These novel approaches navigate practical insights for tailoring marketing strategies to align with consumer preferences. Understanding consumer behaviour through these advanced, non-invasive techniques is becoming essential for organisations aiming to create impactful, evidence-based campaigns. This research reviews the most prominent non-invasive techniques and evaluates how neuromarketing frameworks can reinterpret two decades of existing literature to inform future marketing practices.

                Amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) is a methodology that targets specific genomic regions of interest for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification so that they can be sequenced to a high depth of coverage. Amplicons are typically chosen to be highly polymorphic, usually with several highly informative, high frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating in an amplicon of 100–200 base pair (bp). This allows high sensitivity detection and quantification of the frequency of each sequence within each sample making it suitable for applications such as low frequency somatic mosaicism detection or minor clone detection in mixed samples. AmpSeq is being increasingly applied to both biological and medical studies, in applications such as cancer, infectious diseases and brain mosaicism studies. Current bioinformatics pipelines for AmpSeq data processing lack downstream analysis, have difficulty distinguishing between true sequences and PCR sequencing errors and artifacts, and often require bioinformatic expertise. We present a new R package: AmpSeqR, designed for the processing of deep short-read amplicon sequencing data, with a focus on infectious diseases. The pipeline integrates several existing R packages combining them with newly developed functions to perform optimal filtering of reads to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the detected sequences data, permitting detection of very low frequency clones in mixed samples. The package provides useful functions including data pre-processing, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) estimation, data post-processing, data visualization, and automatically generates a comprehensive Rmarkdown report that contains all essential results facilitating easy inclusion into reports and publications. AmpSeqR is publicly available at https://github.com/bahlolab/AmpSeqR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1131/v1?src=rss">Bringing Numbers to Life and Reducing Anxiety: An Augmented Reality and Haptic Feedback-Based Mathematics Game for Primary School Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mathematics is a basic discipline which causes anxiety to primary school students, resulting in reduced motivation for learning and poor achievements. Traditional instruction heavily leans on abstract symbols, which can add to cognitive load and a feeling of emotional opposition. To address this issue, this study developed a learning model integrating augmented reality (AR) and haptic feedback to create an interactive and multisensory mathematics experience. A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 120 students divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used the AR–haptic mathematics game for six weeks, while the control group learned through textbooks and teacher explanations. Data was gathered by using the conceptual understanding tests, a mathematics anxiety scale, classroom observations and student interviews. The quantitative data were analyzed by t-test, ANCOVA and MANOVA analysis; qualitative data were analyzed positionally. The results indicated significant progress in experimental groups’ conceptual understanding and mathematics anxiety decrease when compared to the control group. The mean for the post-test experimental group was 82, and for the control group, it was 62 with a large effect size. The average level of maths anxiety decreased in the experimental group from 3.2 to 1.8 on a five-point scale. Qualitative feedback revealed that students found the game engaging, enjoyable, and less intimidating than traditional lessons. The integration of AR and haptic feedback effectively enhanced both cognitive and affective outcomes in mathematics learning. The multisensory environment enabled students to interact with abstract concepts in tangible ways, reducing anxiety and promoting positive attitudes toward mathematics. This provides a proof of concept for the effectiveness of immersive technologies as assistive tools in the enhancement of academic achievement and emotional health related to elementary level mathematics learning.

                Background Infertility has become a significant issue that requires attention as its prevalence has increased globally and nationally in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. This study aimed to explore patients’ perceptions towards infertility and in vitro fertilization-related services. Additionally, this study examined the barriers that prevent couples from seeking infertility treatment and IVF in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Methods This study employed a qualitative, hybrid thematic analysis approach. Fifteen participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into three categories: infertility patients, infertility caregivers, and administrative staff working in infertility clinics. Results This study identified four main themes: patients’ experiences, infertility services in Eastern Province, and perceived barriers to receiving treatment. Participants reported that they believed infertility was on the rise, especially male infertility. The reported obstacles included financial burdens, lack of awareness, societal influences, and lengthy, complex treatment processes. Conclusions This study highlights the significant barriers that couples encounter in accessing infertility treatment. These findings emphasize the urgent need for improved public health policies, such as utilizing case management to support patients and incorporating insurance coverage for infertility treatments, along with enhanced support services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1129/v1?src=rss">Integration of Break Dance and Computational Physics: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Contextualized Teaching [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study presents an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach aimed at contextualizing the teaching of classical mechanics through the computational analysis of Break Dance movements. Situated within a constructivist framework, the research explores how culturally embedded practices—specifically urban dance—can serve as a medium for fostering conceptual understanding of physics in non-formal educational settings. By leveraging the artistic and kinesthetic dimensions of Break Dance, the study seeks to bridge the gap between abstract scientific content and learners’ lived experiences. Method A mixed-method, exploratory design was employed with a purposive sample of ten dancers (aged 13–30) affiliated with a community-based urban dance school in Bogotá, Colombia. Over the course of six three-hour sessions, participants engaged in movement analysis using Tracker video software, supported by pre- and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. The research design incorporated thematic analysis to interpret qualitative data, complemented by the kinematic study of body movement parameters such as angular velocity and center of mass. Results Findings indicate a marked cognitive shift among participants from intuitive and superficial conceptions to a more technical and applied understanding of physics principles. The integration of computational tools allowed dancers to visualize and internalize biomechanical variables relevant to their performance. Participants reported enhanced bodily control, injury prevention, and aesthetic execution, alongside increased motivation and collaborative learning. Conclusions The study concludes that embedding scientific content within culturally relevant, embodied practices—mediated by educational technologies—can significantly enhance learning outcomes in physics. The use of Tracker software not only demystified abstract concepts but also redefined physics as accessible and contextually meaningful. These results underscore the pedagogical potential of transdisciplinary, arts-integrated methodologies to foster inclusive, situated, and cognitively rich science education in non-traditional environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1128/v1?src=rss">Gender equity in scientific production in Peru and Colombia: reality or utopia in public universities? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Within the context of research, gender equity in public universities entails significant challenges that must be addressed, leading to the restructuring of processes related to philosophy, paradigm, and management policies. This restructuring enables the conceptualization of an educational paradigm in which both men and women can cultivate their potential in an equitable manner, thereby generating scientific, technological, social, and humanistic knowledge within the scientific realm. Methods The objective of this research was to analyze the challenges and opportunities associated with achieving gender equity in the scientific production of national universities in Peru and Colombia. A mixed-methods approach was employed to gain a global understanding of the phenomenon under study, allowing for the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data depending on the research focus. The population and sample were defined by the national universities of Peru and Colombia, analyzing scientific production in both countries and establishing trends between male and female contributors. The technique used for quantitative data was documentary analysis of scientific production, utilizing the Scopus database for analysis. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with research managers. Instruments included a summary sheet and an interview protocol. Results The results indicate a pronounced tendency toward higher scientific production among men across various fields of knowledge. This phenomenon exacerbates the existing gender parity gap and effectively relegates women to a secondary role within the academic landscape. Conclusions It is concluded that national universities in Peru and Colombia must undergo restructuring processes in their organizational functions, with gender equity as a central component, in order to contribute to the co-construction of a fair and balanced society.

                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. No research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Methods This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument to measure how parents impact young learners’ motivation to learn English and to engage with tasks. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical role of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study improves the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ab5c0a8c-0081-4ab3-970d-c40f5b4c5256/ana78050-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Recombinant Human Neuregulin1-β1 Significantly Reduces Schwannoma Growth in Mice"/>
<p>rhNRGβ1-Replacement-Therapy: Under physiological conditions, NRGβ1 is expressed on axons (in orange), where it activates ERBB2 receptors, facilitating successful nerve regeneration following injury. However, loss of NF2 leads to a reduction in NRGβ1-expression and increased ErbB2 levels on Schwann cells (in green), which contributes to schwannoma formation, particularly in conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis. The replacement of NRGβ1-signaling using recombinant human Neuregulin1-β1 (rhNRGβ1) represents a new strategy for schwannoma treatment. This approach reduces schwannoma growth by promoting Schwann cell differentiation and maturation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells of the nerve sheath, and their management presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly in genetic conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN). Although current treatments, including surgery, radiation, and repurposed pharmacological agents, can be effective, they are often limited by issues such as tumor recurrence and the risk of nerve function impairment. This study aims to evaluate the potential of recombinant human Neuregulin1 beta 1 (rhNRGβ1) to inhibit schwannoma growth and promote Schwann cell differentiation in preclinical models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of rhNRGβ1, a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of Neuregulin1 beta 1, as a growth-inhibitory agent for schwannomas. Two distinct mouse models were used to assess its efficacy, with both histological and functional endpoints analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both systemic and local administration of rhNRGβ1 resulted in a significant reduction in schwannoma tumor growth. Mechanistically, rhNRGβ1 not only inhibited tumor proliferation, but also promoted the differentiation of both proliferative and de-differentiated Schwann cells, suggesting a dual action of growth inhibition and cellular maturation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of rhNRG1-β1 in managing schwannomas, not only by reducing tumor growth, but also by promoting the maturation and functional restoration of Schwann cells. This dual effect provides a promising avenue for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing both the growth and cellular differentiation challenges associated with schwannomas in NF2-SWN and other related conditions.

     alt="Characterizing Evoked Movement Patterns and Connectivity in Sensorimotor Cortex After Sensory Loss in Squirrel Monkeys"/>
<p>Excitability to long-train intracortical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex after recovery from long-term sensory loss tended to be altered but was not statistically different from that of normal and intact hemispheres. Cortical connection patterns of areas 3b and M1 were consistent with early findings, characterized by the presence of sparse but widespread connections after sensory loss. The results suggest that the sensorimotor system undergoes both anatomical and functional reorganization in response to compensating for sensory loss.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sensory feedback is crucial for movement execution, especially in the highly specialized skilled hand use in humans and other primates. Extensive sensory loss of tactile and proprioceptive inputs from the hand initially results in severe motor deficits, but recovery occurs gradually over time. To determine how sensory loss from one hand affects evoked forelimb movements from sensorimotor cortical areas, lesions were selectively placed in the ascending somatosensory pathway in the dorsal column in the cervical spinal cord (C5, DCL) of three squirrel monkeys. After 1 year of postlesion recovery, we examined the long-term effects of DCL on motor response patterns evoked by long-train intracortical microstimulation (LT-ICMS) from the hand cortex in primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in both control and DCL groups. Somatosensory receptive fields were mapped primarily to define the borders of area 3b, as well as to compare somatosensory responses with motor responses after DCL. Corticocortical connections were investigated by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into the sensory-deprived forelimb regions of 3b and M1. We found that after somatosensory loss and compensation, LT-ICMS-evoked movement maps for M1 and deprived somatosensory areas did not show statistically detectable effects of DCL. Results were consistent with our earlier findings of the effects of long-term recovery from DCL on somatosensory response maps and connections among somatosensory areas. We now show that the effects of long-term DCL on evoked motor responses in somatosensory cortex were limited, while the connections between M1 cortex and somatosensory cortical areas were more widespread.</p>

                Pilat et al. show that the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated gain-of-function mutation, T96K, in the microglial receptor Trem2 reduces levels of soluble Trem2 and Aβ uptake in microglial cells and impairs microglial function, specifically in female 5xFAD mice. These findings should help guide the development of TREM2-targeted therapies for treating AD.

                Med20 safeguards peripheral myelination by suppressing Schwann cell ferroptosis. Loss of Med20 in Schwann cells triggers ferroptosis via the DDB1-UHRF1-BACH1-Hmox1 axis, disrupting myelin sheath formation. Pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 (ZnPP) or ferroptosis (Fer-1) rescues myelination defects, revealing a therapeutic strategy for PNS disorders linked to Med20 dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99614">Remote automated delivery of mechanical stimuli coupled to brain recordings in behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The canonical framework for testing pain and mechanical sensitivity in rodents is manual delivery of stimuli to the paw. However, this approach is time-consuming, produces variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the automated reproducible mechanostimulator (ARM). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning-based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice habituated more quickly when an experimenter was not present, and experimenter presence led to significant sex-dependent differences in paw withdrawal and pain-associated behaviors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdala neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map central control of pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104443">Adult neurogenesis reconciles flexibility and stability of olfactory perceptual memory</a></h4>

              
                In brain regions featuring ongoing plasticity, the task of quickly encoding new information without overwriting old memories presents a significant challenge. In the rodent olfactory bulb, which is renowned for substantial structural plasticity driven by adult neurogenesis and persistent turnover of dendritic spines, we show that by synergistically combining both types of plasticity, this flexibility-stability dilemma can be overcome. To do so, we develop a computational model for structural plasticity in the olfactory bulb and show that it is the maturation process of adult-born neurons that enables the bulb to learn quickly and forget slowly. Particularly important are the transient enhancement of the plasticity, excitability, and susceptibility to apoptosis that characterizes young neurons. The model captures many experimental observations and makes a number of testable predictions. Overall, it identifies memory consolidation as an important role of adult neurogenesis in olfaction and exemplifies how the brain can maintain stable memories despite ongoing extensive neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94802">Alternative splicing across the tree of life</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing understanding of how alternative splicing contributes to functional specialization and adaptation, especially in well-studied model organisms. However, its large-scale evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Through a comparative analysis of alternative splicing across 1494 species spanning the entire tree of life, this study integrates numerous lines of prior evidence to provide a unified view of alternative splicing. We propose a novel genome-scale metric designed to support cross-species comparison. Our findings indicate that alternative splicing is highly variable across lineages. While unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes display minimal splicing, mammals and birds exhibit the highest levels of alternative splicing. Despite sharing a conserved intron-rich genomic architecture, mammals and birds show considerable interspecies divergence in splicing activity. In contrast, plants display moderate levels of alternative splicing but exhibit high variability of genomic composition. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is observed between alternative splicing and the proportion of coding content in genes, with the highest levels of alternative splicing observed in genomes containing approximately 50% intergenic DNA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105504">scRNA+TCR-seq reveals the proportion and characteristics of dual TCR Treg cells in mouse lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues</a></h4>

              
                The rearrangement of TCR germline V(D)J genes during T cell development, including allelic exclusion and tolerance selection, ensures the clonal selection theory, which states that ‘a lymphocyte expresses only one type of antigen receptor’. This forms the basis for T cell-specific responses. However, the existence of ‘dual TCR T cells’ has consistently been supported by specific experimental evidence. Detailed reports on the origin, proportion, tissue distribution, and CDR3 characteristics of ‘dual TCR Treg cells’ are currently lacking. In this study, we utilized scRNA+TCR-seq technology to achieve in-depth analysis of single and dual TCR T pairings, along with their mRNA expressions, from over 5000 T cells in each sample. Through comparative studies with shared databases, we provided a detailed analysis of the proportions and characteristics of dual TCR Tregs in mouse lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues (such as inguinal lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, blood, and skin). Our findings revealed a high proportion of dual TCR Tregs across various mouse tissues, with their TCR pairing patterns, V(D)J usage, and mRNA expression showing both homogeneity and certain differences compared to single TCR Tregs, as well as heterogeneity across different tissue sites. This research provides new insights and technical approaches for studying the origins, characteristics, effects, and mechanisms of Treg cells in different tissue locations.

">Hierarchical regulation of cerebellar neurogenesis by Sin3A-mediated gene repression</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar granule cells (GCs) are critical for motor and cognitive functions. Lineage tracing studies have identified a hierarchical developmental progression of GC neurogenesis, transitioning from Sox2+ stem-like cells to Atoh1+ rapidly proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs), and ultimately to NeuN+ mature GCs. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transient, slow-cycling progenitor population defined by co-expression of Sox2 and Atoh1. We show that GC maturation depends critically on the repressive function of the Sin3A/Hdac1 complex, which sequentially silences Sox2 and then Atoh1 to ensure orderly progression through developmental stages. Loss of these repressions prolongs progenitor states, compromises survival, and markedly reduces GC output. We also identify NeuroD1 as a co-repressor that collaborates with Sin3A/Hdac1 to inhibit Atoh1 transcription. Our findings highlight the central role of the Sin3A complex in orchestrating distinct stages of cerebellar GC lineage development and may provide insights into Sin3A-related cerebellar disorders and medulloblastoma in human.

">C. elegans astrocytes mature in two phases from lineally distinct progenitors through CEH-43/DLX-mediated convergent transcription</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytic glia regulate brain assembly, synapse formation/activity, neuronal energetics, and brain metabolism. Gene programs driving astrocyte specification are only partly understood. Here, we use lineage-restricted single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover a two-phase developmental program for C. elegans CEPsh astrocyte differentiation. In phase one, newly generated astrocytes acquire common transcription profiles despite arising from lineally and transcriptionally distinct progenitors. Convergent differentiation is mediated by the distal-less transcription factor CEH-43. CEH-43 is expressed in astrocytes and their progenitors, binds conserved astrocyte-expressed genes, and cell-autonomously controls astrocyte-specific gene expression. Forced misexpression of CEH-43 in the embryo promotes ectopic expression of astrocyte-specific reporters. The second gene expression phase, directing astrocyte maturation, is also under CEH-43 control. Homologs of CEPsh astrocyte-enriched genes are preferentially enriched in mammalian astrocytes, and the CEH-43 homologs DLX1/2 are expressed in mouse astrocytes. Our findings suggest parallels between CEPsh and mammalian astrocyte development, implicating conserved regulators in astrocyte cell-fate acquisition.

">Innovative 3D-image analysis of cerebellar vascularization highlights angiogenic gene dysregulations in a murine model of apnea of prematurity</a></h4>

              
                Apnea of prematurity (AOP) affects 50% of preterm infants causing intermittent hypoxia (IH), which can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Cerebellar abnormalities have been observed in AOP but the relationship between vascular alterations and neural development remains unclear. This study investigates how IH affects cerebellar angiogenesis using a murine model of AOP. We developed an innovative 3D imaging workflow combining IMARIS and VesselVio software to quantitatively analyze cerebellar vascularization at different postnatal stages (P4, P8, P12, P21, and P70). We correlate these results with a transcriptomic analysis of 23 angiogenesis-related genes in the same stages to uncover the associated molecular pathways. We found that IH induced significant vascular changes, particularly at P4, with a global increase in vascular-network dimensions. By P8, the vascular network normalized, but genes were downregulated in all pathways studied. After P12, at the end of the IH protocol, transcriptional regulations vary but persist long-term. Moreover, differential analysis showed distinct effects on superficial versus deep vascular networks, allowing for a more precise understanding of remodeling patterns throughout development. Overall, transcriptomic changes were associated with morphological alterations in a time-dependent manner, suggesting a multiphasic IH response through development with lasting effects. Key regulations included VEGF, angiopoietin, and matrix metalloprotease signaling. These findings demonstrate that IH disrupts cerebellar angiogenesis in parallel with neurogenesis, potentially contributing to the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in AOP. Thus, the interconnected nature of angio- and neurogenesis during cerebellar development makes it crucial to take vascular aspects into account in therapeutic approaches to neurodevelopmental disorders.

">DLK inhibition has sex-specific effects on neuroprotection and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes devastating functional deficits, in part due to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity that drive death of lesion-adjacent viable neurons. One signaling protein that promotes neuronal apoptosis and activates stress-responsive genes is dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), which is a neuron-enriched kinase that responds to extracellular stress by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We hypothesized that SCI would robustly activate DLK signaling and that acute pharmacological inhibition of DLK would suppress JNK pathway activation, thereby enhancing neuroprotection and locomotor recovery in our mouse model of moderate contusion SCI. Using western blotting, we observed that SCI induced strong and sustained activation of the JNK pathway in the injured spinal cord starting at 4 hours post-injury through 7 days. Complementary analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq revealed that DLK expression is highly enriched in neurons across all injury phases. Following SCI, neurons exhibited robust, time-dependent upregulation of multiple DLK-responsive transcripts, consistent with sustained pathway activation during the acute and subacute periods. Systemic treatment with the selective DLK inhibitor IACS'825 effectively suppressed intraspinal JUN activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, unexpectedly, DLK inhibition delayed functional recovery in male mice and expanded lesion volume by 71%, with no significant effect in females. These findings highlight the complex roles of DLK signaling after SCI, revealing a need to understand the sex-specific molecular mechanisms that modulate injury outcomes. Future studies should further optimize timing, location, and cellular targeting of DLK therapeutic strategies to improve neuroprotection and neurologic recovery after SCI.

">Cortical Iron in Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Diffusion Tensor Imaging MRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Background and Hypothesis Cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia remain poorly treated. Iron dysregulation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia. While elevated postmortem iron in Brodmann areas 10-11 has been linked to schizophrenia, this has not been assessed in vivo. We therefore used iron-sensitive MRI to test whether cortical iron is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Study Design We acquired quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI to measure magnetic susceptibility ({chi}), a marker of iron, in 158 participants aged 18-45 (73 with schizophrenia and 76 matched healthy controls). As {chi} is reduced by myelin, we conducted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess mean diffusivity, an iron-insensitive marker also reduced by myelin. Study Results Primary analyses showed no significant case-control differences in {chi} in the whole cortex (p=0.675) or Brodmann areas 10-11 (p=0.537). Exploratory analyses examined {chi} for 362 cortical regions and a voxelwise analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons. Two left temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction regions showed significantly elevated {chi} in schizophrenia: the posterior TPO junction (d=0.752, p<0.001) and the superior temporal visual area (d=0.638, p=0.033), which remained significant after adjusting for mean diffusivity and clinical covariates (p=0.001 and p=0.023, respectively). Voxelwise analysis confirmed elevated {chi} in schizophrenia in the left TPO junction (peak t=5.62). Conclusions This study provides the first in vivo evidence of elevated cortical iron in schizophrenia, suggesting regional iron accumulation may contribute to cortical pathology.

">Attentional disengagement during external and internal distractions reduces neural speech tracking in background noise</a></h4>

              
                Within-situation disengagement - the mental withdrawal during conversations in acoustically challenging environments - is a common experience of older people with hearing difficulties. Yet, most research on the neural mechanisms of attentional disengagement from speech listening has focused on the distraction by one competing speaker, whereas within-situation disengagement is often characterized by distraction towards external visual stimuli or internal thoughts and occurs in situations with ambient, multi-talker background masking. Across three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, the current study examined how disengagement due to external and internal distractions affect the neural tracking of speech masked by different levels of multi-talker babble (speech in quiet, +6 dB, and -3 dB SNR). We observed early (<200 ms), enhanced neural responses to the speech envelope for speech masked by background babble compared to speech in quiet (Experiments 1-3), suggesting stochastic facilitation. Importantly, neural tracking of the speech envelope was reduced when individuals were distracted by a visual-stimulus stream (Experiment 2) and by internal thought and imagination (Experiment 3). There were some indices suggesting the greatest disengagement-related decline in neural speech tracking occurs for the most difficult speech-masking condition, but this was not consistent across all measures. The current data show that disengagement due to external and internal distractions yield decreases in neural speech tracking, potentially suggesting a common neural pathway through which gain is downregulated in auditory cortex. These results indicate that disengagement from listening can be identified through non-invasive neural measures.

">Specific and converging modulation of the CRH and noradrenergic systems across drug classes and natural rewards in an incubation of seeking paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Stress is known to play a critical role in relapse to drug use as well as in food craving. Craving itself is a key determinant of relapse, and cue-induced drug craving has been shown to increase, or incubate, over time for certain drugs such as cocaine and nicotine, though this effect is less consistent for others such as opiates. However, the contribution of stress-related biochemical systems to the incubation of seeking has not yet been systematically examined in animal models, nor has the specificity of these mechanisms been tested across different drug classes or reinforcers. To address this gap, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, i.v.), heroin (0.075 mg/kg, i.v.), or saline, and subsequently assessed changes in plasma corticosterone, ornithine and other stress-related amines, alongside central gene and protein expression (CRH, CRH2 receptor, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor subunits) after 1 or 30 days of withdrawal. A parallel experiment was conducted using sucrose as a reinforcer. Our findings indicate that although most effects were substance-specific, convergent adaptations were also observed, particularly within noradrenergic systems, suggesting that these mechanisms may represent a common substrate of incubation and a potential target for pharmacological interventions in relapse.

">Gradual proactive regulation of body state by reinforcement learning of homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Living systems maintain physiological variables such as temperature, blood pressure, and glucose within narrow ranges; a process known as homeostasis. Homeostasis involves not only reactive feedback but also anticipatory adjustments shaped by experience. Prior homeostatic reinforcement learning (HRL) models have provided a computational account of anticipatory regulation under homeostatic challenges. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for gradual, trial-by-trial adjustment and for extinction learning. To address this issue, we developed a continuous HRL framework that enables trial-wise tuning of anticipatory regulation. The model incorporates biologically informed components: asymmetric reinforcement, weighting negative outcomes more than positive outcomes; and a dual-unit, context-gated inhibitory mechanism. We applied the framework to thermoregulatory conditioning with ethanol-induced hypothermia and successfully reproduced cue-triggered compensation, gradual tolerance, and rapid reacquisition after extinction. We then extended the framework to multiple physiological variables influenced by shared neural or hormonal control signals, and found that when regulatory priorities across variables were uneven, a deviation in one variable propagated through shared control to others, yielding a cascading, system-wide failure to return to ideal state (non-recovery); a pattern reminiscent of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., dysautonomia, ME/CFS). Overall, our framework provides a computational basis to advances a systems-level understanding of multi-organ homeostatic dysregulation in vivo.

">Mnemonic maps of visual space in human prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural theories of how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports working memory rely on evidence from decades of pioneering macaque research. In some respects, efforts to translate these animal models of working memory in human PFC using neuroimaging have largely failed. One possible explanation, before concluding key non-homologies between the species, is that previous neuroimaging studies used resolutions too coarse to be sensitive to intermixed distributions of neurons tuned to memorized features. To resolve this concern, we scanned human PFC at 900 micron resolution using 7T fMRI. We found that population activity in retinotopically-organized superior precentral sulcus, rather than the predicted midlateral PFC, persists during memory, encodes fine-grained information about memorized items, predicts behavioral errors in memory, and forms a stable subspace with a topological organization yoked to visual space. These results have important implications for both functional homologies between the species and theories of how the PFC supports working memory.

">Reaching for a domain-general syntax: processing linguistic structures and grasping an object with a tool share similar neural codes in the basal ganglia.</a></h4>

              
                Are actions organized like sentences? Recent evidence showed reciprocal transfer between tool use and syntactic comprehension, reflecting shared basal ganglia (BG) resources for action and language. The proposed mechanism is that embedding a tool into the motor plan increases the hierarchical structure of actions paralleling the organization of sentences. If so, overlap with linguistic computations should emerge specifically during the initiation and/or reach-to-grasp phase, when tool embedding dynamically updates the relation with the target, rather than when the object is stably held in the tool grip. Forty French native speakers underwent fMRI while performing a sentence comprehension (object vs. subject relatives), and a motor task (with pliers vs. hand). Only the reach-to-grasp phase with the tool elicited neural patterns resembling those of object-relatives, within overlapping BG regions. This phase-specific convergence identifies the BG as a hub for domain-general hierarchical computations, unifying syntactic embedding for language and tool use.

">A cortical signature of very preterm birth across development and its association with neurodevelopmental outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Gestational age plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, and individuals born very preterm (VPT) are at elevated risk for cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric problems across the lifespan. Better understanding of the impact of very preterm birth on cortical maturation trajectories could inform mechanistic insights into the origins of these sequelae. Here we compared cortical morphology between VPT individuals and full-term controls in three datasets spanning birth, childhood and adulthood. We identified a consistent cortical signature of VPT birth, characterized by reduced surface area and cortical folding in the frontal, temporal, parietal and insular regions, which persisted across development. Furthermore, in two large infant cohorts, we found that this cortical signature was significantly associated with neonatal clinical factors and with poorer motor outcomes at follow-up, suggesting its potential as a neuroimaging marker for long-term neurodevelopmental risk. Given that early motor development plays a key role in shaping infants interactions with the environment and supporting later cognitive and behavioural development, our findings provide insights into the neurobiological pathways linking VPT birth to subsequent neurodevelopmental difficulties.

">Behavioral and Modeling Evidence that Eye Movements Bias Self-motion Perception</a></h4>

              
                To navigate the world, humans must integrate what they see with how they move. As the body moves, for example, the eyes rotate to explore the environment; these eye rotations, in turn, alter the visual signals used to judge body motion. Yet the practical impact of gaze dynamics on self-motion perception remains poorly understood. We tested how gaze position and gaze velocity shape self-motion perception--specifically heading direction--from visual signals in two behavioral experiments. In Experiment 1, we directly manipulated gaze position and velocity; in Experiment 2, a range of task demands evoked distinct gaze patterns. Across both experiments, heading estimates showed systematic, gaze-dependent errors: these estimates shifted toward the direction of eye motion and grew with horizontal gaze eccentricity and speed. A Bayesian ideal observer reproduced these error patterns across participants and tasks when it included three known features of visuomotor processing: (i) encoding retinal motion with eccentricity-dependent noise, (ii) underestimating eye-rotation speed, and (iii) a prior for moving straight ahead. These results reveal a lawful coupling between oculomotor behavior and heading perception. They further suggest that natural gaze strategies, such as keeping gaze near the optic-flow singularity and limiting pursuit speed, help mitigate gaze-dependent biases during navigation.

">Early developmental neuronal activity inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation through AMPA receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a lipid-rich membrane that wraps neuronal axons in the central nervous system to provide metabolic and trophic support and allow for saltatory conduction. Developmental myelination requires precisely timed and localized neuron-oligodendrocyte communication. In the mature brain, neuronal activity promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation, but how OPCs respond to neuronal activity in early brain development, prior to the onset of myelination, is less well characterized. Here, we investigate how sensory-evoked and chemogenetically altered neuronal activity affect oligodendrocyte maturation in the olfactory system, somatosensory cortex, and corpus callosum in mice. We find that early neuronal activity inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation and that reduced neuronal activity relieves this inhibition, thereby increasing OPC differentiation. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes when neuronal activity was reduced, including upregulation of glutamate receptor gene expression. Finally, we identify AMPAR signaling as a critical regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation ex vivo.

">Reward and punishment promote distinct computational effort profiles for adaptive cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Human motivation is fundamentally shaped by one's expectations of the reward they could earn for good performance or the punishment they would avoid for poor performance. However, the extent to which distinct brain regions are selectively associated with specific incentives and/or their corresponding influence on control strategy remains unclear. Using model-based fMRI and a novel multi-incentive control task, we observed distinct neural patterns by incentive valence, with ventral striatum and caudal subregion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showing greater sensitivity to rewards whereas inferior frontal gyrus and rostral subregion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showing greater sensitivity to penalties. Reward-sensitive regions were associated with increased efficiency (e.g., faster responding with moderate decreases in accuracy) whereas penalty-sensitive regions were associated with increased caution (e.g., slower responding with increased accuracy). We disentangled the global and selective influences of motivation on control processes and subjective experience, providing novel insight into the neurocomputational mechanisms of how effort is determined by expected reward and punishment.

">Neurocognitive dynamics of translating information from a spatial map into action</a></h4>

              
                How do we translate information from a spatial map to action in our immediate surroundings? Despite the widespread use of various tools for orientation, from paper maps to GPS, this fundamental question remains unanswered in our understanding of human spatial navigation. To investigate this, we implemented a perspective-taking task in immersive virtual reality combined with mobile EEG, aiming to disentangle the neurocognitive processes involved. Thirty-eight young adults were presented with a virtual 2D map in which we manipulated both the perspective shift and the physical angle of rotation required to align with a target, as well as the congruency between these two variables. Behaviourally, angular error during pointing increased slightly and linearly with perspective shift. However, the relationship between rotation angle and accuracy revealed a non-linear pattern, with better performance around the antero-posterior bodily-axis. Regarding congruency, angular error increased for incongruent trials, but only when the perspective-taking angle exceeded 90 degrees. At the neural level, activity in the retrosplenial complex (RSC) revealed a sequential organization with alpha-band modulation during perspective shift, followed by beta-band activity reflecting preparation for the required physical rotation. In addition, incongruency between perspective-taking and physical rotation increased beta activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (lTPJ). Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of immersive virtual environments to investigate the neural correlates of real-world navigation and the complexity of perspective-taking mechanisms.

">Microglial plasticity across development mediates infantile amnesia</a></h4>

              
                Infantile amnesia, the inability to recall episodic memories formed during early childhood, is a hallmark of postnatal brain development. Yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This work aimed to gain a better mechanistic understanding of infantile amnesia. Microglia, specialized macrophages of the central nervous system, are known to play an important role in synaptic refinement during postnatal development and have recently been implicated in memory related functions. Here, we identified microglia as key regulators of memory accessibility in infancy. We profiled dynamic changes in microglial morphology across the postnatal window that parallelled the onset of infantile forgetting. We found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity during a specific postnatal window prevents infantile amnesia for a contextual fear memory, implicating microglia as active modulators of infant memory persistence. Using activity-dependent tagging of infant encoded engram cells, we demonstrated that microglial inhibition alters engram size and engram reactivation in the amygdala and results in changes in microglia-engram cell interactions. Furthermore, we characterized a relationship between microglial dysfunction and the lack of infantile amnesia in MIA offspring. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for microglia in regulating infant memory retrieval and suggest that microglial dysfunction may contribute to altered memory trajectories in neurodevelopmental disorders.

">What is next? Predictable visual sequences are encoded with anticipatory biases and reduced neural responses</a></h4>

              
                Objects in motion follow predictable trajectories that the brain can easily anticipate. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms, focusing on a form of representational momentum (RM), whereby the final state of a rotating object is misperceived along its future trajectory. Participants viewed two simultaneous streams of oriented gratings, one rotating predictably and the other random, and were instructed to attend to one of the two. Using EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and decoding analysis, we found that attending to rotational sequences led to reduced neural response amplitude and systematic anticipatory shifts in the neural representation of orientation, relative to random sequences. These anticipatory biases emerged at early post-stimulus latencies and mirrored behavioral signatures of RM. Our findings suggest that the brain leverages internalized dynamics to form stable anticipatory representations with reduced neural activity strength.

">Mapping neural subspace dynamics onto the structure of the mouse descending motor system</a></h4>

              
                The motor cortex supports various cognitive and motor functions. To prevent interference between these processes, the associated neural dynamics may be organized into orthogonal subspaces. In this subspace model, activity in a movement-null subspace encodes internal processes, while activity in a movement-potent subspace relates to movements. The biological implementation of this model, how activity in different subspaces map onto neural circuits, remains unclear. Particularly, it is unknown whether different cell types, with specific connectivity patterns, preferentially contribute to specific subspaces. Here, we test whether the cell type that directly links motor cortex to motor centers in the medulla and spinal cord, lower layer 5b extratelencephalic neurons (L-ETN), preferentially encodes activity contained in the movement-potent subspace. We performed cell-type-specific recordings in the motor cortex while mice performed a delayed-response licking task, and decomposed population activity into movement-null and movement-potent subspaces. We find that L-ETN activity spans both movement-null and movement-potent subspaces in a manner that could not be distinguished from the broader motor cortex population. Notably, downstream medullary circuits retain a subset of the movement-null dynamics contained in motor cortex, with select movement-null signals specifically filtered out. These results indicate that a distinct cortical output alone does not mediate the cancelation of movement-null dynamics; movement-null computations are instead distributed across the descending motor hierarchy.

">Representational Similarity and Pattern Classification of Fifteen Emotional States Induced by Movie Clips and Text Scenarios</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical models emphasize that categorical factors, dimensional factors, or their combination may define the semantic space organization of emotion representations. While recent behavioral work has applied innovative multivariate methods for testing these theories, neuroscientific assessments remain limited due to a focus on a small number of emotions, single theoretical perspectives, univariate methods, or small sample sizes. We overcame these limitations in a comprehensive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which participants (N = 136) viewed 150 movie clips and 150 text scenarios that reliably induced 15 different emotional states spanning positive, negative, and neutral valence. For the movie inductions, representational similarity analysis yielded a correspondence between the categorical behavioral responses and the brain activity patterns, and partial least squares discriminant analysis achieved strong decoding performance for all 15 emotions from whole-brain fMRI data, with importance maps encompassing cortical, limbic, and subcortical regions. Classification error analyses and a Bayesian model comparison supported the categorical nature of the emotion representations relative to a 2-dimensional arousal-valence model. Hierarchical clustering of the representational dissimilarity matrices revealed that the 15 emotions were organized into similarly meaningful clusters at both the subjective and neural levels. Results from the scenario inductions, while demonstrating similar behavioral effects and behavioral hierarchical structures, were more difficult to decode from the fMRI data. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into how emotions are organized and represented in the human brain and evidence a relationship between our subjective experience of and brain responses to emotional inductions.

">Fatty Acid Pathways Regulate Thermal Nociception in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain remains a major unmet medical challenge, and lipid signaling pathways have emerged as key modulators of nociception. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a genetically tractable model, we investigated how fatty acid composition influences thermal avoidance behavior. Mutant strains lacking functional desaturase enzymes (elo-1, fat-1, fat-2, fat-3, fat-4, fat-6/fat-7), and consequently depleted in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid, displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to noxious heat compared to wild-type animals. These findings indicate that intact PUFA biosynthesis is essential for normal thermal nociception in C. elegans. Given that arachidonic acid is a precursor of endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG) known to modulate TRPV1-dependent pain signaling, our results suggest that a conserved lipid-based mechanism regulates heat avoidance in nematodes. This study establishes a functional link between fatty acid metabolism and nociceptive behavior, providing a powerful platform to explore metabolic modulation of pain pathways.

">Paw switching with lateralized cholinergic modulation</a></h4>

              
                Motor preferences, such as handedness, reflect fundamental asymmetries in brain function and behavior across vertebrate species, including humans and rodents1. Although individual hand or paw preferences are typically stable, they can be reshaped through experience or training, underscoring the plasticity of lateralized motor circuits2. However, the neural mechanisms that enable this behavioral switching remain unclear. Here we show that experience-driven shifts in paw preference in mice arise from asymmetric cholinergic modulation between the two hemispheres. Using a behavioral paradigm designed to induce paw switching, we found that a subset of animals developed a stable change in preference following training. Selective activation or inhibition of cholinergic neurons on one side of the brain was sufficient to bias this switching behavior. During lateralized movements, an endogenous imbalance in cholinergic activity emerges between the hemispheres, suggesting that interhemispheric cholinergic asymmetry enables motor flexibility. These findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which cholinergic signaling dynamically regulates lateralized motor control, providing insight into how hemispheric imbalances may shape persistent individual motor preferences.

">Preemptive SOD1 Silencing via Neonatal Intramuscular AAV Therapy Modifies Disease Trajectory in an ALS Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Mutations in SOD1 are a leading genetic cause of familial ALS, driving motor neuron degeneration through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. While gene silencing strategies targeting SOD1 hold therapeutic promise, their clinical translation has been hindered by inefficient delivery to the spinal cord and safety concerns associated with conventional viral vectors. Here, we report a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 suppression. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended survival, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA platform demonstrated a superior safety profile compared to shRNA-based constructs, which caused severe toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice. Our study establishes neonatal intramuscular delivery of rAAV2-retro-miRNA as a safe, efficient, and clinically translatable strategy for preemptive intervention in SOD1-mediated ALS, with broad implications for the treatment of other motor neuron diseases.

">Improved inference of latent neural states from calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Calcium imaging (CI) is a standard method for recording neural population activity, as it enables simultaneous recording of hundreds-to-thousands of individual somatic signals. Accordingly, CI recordings are prime candidates for population-level latent variable analyses, for example using models such as Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and latent dynamical systems. However, these models have been primarily developed and fine-tuned for electrophysiological measurements of spiking activity. To adapt these models for use with the calcium signals recorded with CI, per-neuron fluorescence time-traces are typically either de-convolved to approximate spiking events or analyzed directly under Gaussian observation assumptions. The former approach, while enabling the direct application of latent variable methods developed for spiking data, suffers from the imprecise nature of spike estimation from CI. Moreover, isolated spikes can be undetectable in the fluorescence signal, creating additional uncertainty. A more direct model linking observed fluorescence to latent variables would account for these sources of uncertainty. Here, we develop accurate and tractable models for characterizing the latent structure of neural population activity from CI data. We propose to augment HMM, GPFA, and dynamical systems models with a CI observation model that consists of latent Poisson spiking and autoregressive calcium dynamics. Importantly, this model is both more flexible and directly compatible with standard methods for fitting latent models of neural dynamics. We demonstrate that using this more accurate CI observation model improves latent variable inference and model fitting on both CI observations generated using state-of-the-art biophysical simulations as well as imaging data recorded in an experimental setting.

">Adaptive recruitment of cortex-wide recurrence for visual object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Theories of the neural mechanism underpinning rapid recognition debate whether it relies solely on a feedforward sweep through the ventral stream or instead requires recurrent processing, possibly engaging additional brain regions. Here we directly tested the "adaptive recurrence hypothesis", that attempts to unify these disparate views by proposing that additional recurrent cortical resources beyond the visual stream are recruited when feedforward processing alone is insufficient to solve object recognition. To investigate this hypothesis, we contrasted functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) responses to compare neural responses to images that are equally well recognized by humans, but that differ in whether they could be solved by a feedforward deep neural network; a computational proxy for ventral stream feedforward processing. We found that when feedforward processing in the ventral visual stream is insufficient, additional parieto-frontal networks are rapidly and transiently recruited, representationally reconfiguring the ventral visual stream. Our results reveal that object recognition flexibly adapts through fast, cortex-wide recurrence, providing a unifying framework for competing theories of visual recognition.

">Synchrony-driven Assemblies Reliably Represent Complex Stimuli in Ferret Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal assemblies defined by coordination at high temporal resolution are thought to act as functional modules for information processing throughout the brain. Here, we develop a new method for identifying these assemblies from analytical tests of pairwise synchrony, benefiting from three rigorous criteria for assembly detection and sensitivity to rare but significant coordinated firing patterns. Following validation through simulations and in vivo recordings, we perform synchrony-based analysis on datasets from both primary (A1) and non-primary (PEG) ferret auditory cortex during passive listening to complex natural sounds. We show that synchrony-driven assemblies (SDAs) in both areas exhibit regular temporal dynamics, including the production of stereotypical spike sequences. In-keeping with their enhanced inter-neuronal reliability, SDAs are observed to outperform random assemblies in two versions of rate-based decoding. We extend these results to temporal decoding, and consistently observe optimal integration windows of 10-20ms. Thus, we suggest that SDAs are sufficient for the accurate representation of diverse sets of complex auditory stimuli, and that this increase in information depends entirely on coordination at very fine temporal scales.

">State dependent shifts in large scale functional topographies</a></h4>

              
                Although functional networks can be consistently identified across cognitive states, they also undergo dynamic reconfigurations across different contexts. For example, naturalistic movie watching paradigms amplify activity in sensory systems compared to resting conditions. However, it remains unclear how these different states affect large-scale brain organization. The current study leveraged high-resolution in vivo 7T fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Precision NeuroImaging (PNI) datasets to examine large scale functional connectivity changes between resting and movie-watching conditions. To understand these changes within topographic and geometric principles of brain organization, connectivity shifts were stratified relative to macroscale cortical hierarchy and geodesic distance. Our results revealed that primary sensory areas showed increased local connectivity and reduced long-range interactions during movie watching relative to resting conditions, whereas the default mode network (DMN) exhibited an opposing pattern characterized by reduced within-network long-range connectivity and enhanced connectivity with distant regions outside the DMN. Together, these findings demonstrate that different cognitive states involve geometry- and hierarchy-informed reorganization of large-scale functional networks.

">Sex-specific relationship between melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity and chronotype across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Light, acting primarily via melanopsin-mediated signaling, plays a central role in synchronising circadian rhythms. Individuals vary markedly in the sensitivity of their circadian system to light. Whether these differences contribute to the interindividual variability in chronotype, a behavioural manifestation of internal circadian timing, is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity and chronotype across the general population.

Methods: Participants (adults and children aged [&ge;] 8 years) were recruited in a science museum. Chronotype was determined using the {micro}MCTQ and the post-illumination pupillary response (PIPR) to short and long-wavelength light stimuli was used as a measure of melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity. The relationship between PIPR and chronotype and their interaction with age and sex were assessed using multiple linear regression.

Results: Pupil recordings and questionnaires were available from 457 participants, including 284 adults and 173 children. In adults, the relationship between melanopsin-dependent light sensitivity and chronotype depends on sex and age: in young adult men, greater light sensitivity is linked to a significantly later chronotype, whereas it is significantly associated with an earlier chronotype in older adult women. In children, no evidence was found for a relationship between light sensitivity and chronotype.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that individual variation in light sensitivity interacts with sex and age-specific differences in the circadian system and light exposure behaviour to influence circadian timing. Light exposure recommendations should be personalised to take into account these sex and age-specific effects.

Statement of significanceWhile individuals differ widely in how their circadian system responds to light, to what extent these individual responses influence internal circadian timing remains unclear. By studying a large and diverse sample of children and adults, our findings reveal that the relationship between light sensitivity and chronotype, a behavioural manifestation of circadian timing, is shaped by both age and sex, offering a more comprehensive understanding of this relationship than previously recognised. Specifically, greater light sensitivity is linked to later chronotype in young men but to earlier chronotype in older women. These results reveal that the impact of light on circadian timing changes across the lifespan and will contribute to the development of personalised light exposure guidelines to promote health and well-being.

">Microstructural Spine Alterations Increase Neuronal Excitability in Focal Cortical Dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                Focal cortical dysplasia(FCD) is a leading cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, traditionally attributed to impaired inhibition. However, recent ultrastructural evidence suggests excitatory synaptic alterations may also contribute. To investigate this, we performed computational modeling of human pyramidal neurons in NEURON, incorporating electron microscopy derived dendritic spine morphologies. Baseline and FCD-like models were constructed with differences in spine density and morphology while maintaining comparable net synaptic input. Simulations revealed that reduced spine density increased input resistance and amplified excitatory postsynaptic potentials, enhancing dendritic to somatic transmission. Spine neck geometry, but not head size, critically shaped voltage compartmentalization. The altered model required markedly fewer synchronous inputs to reach spiking threshold and exhibited higher firing rates under Poisson distributed synaptic activity, particularly under sparse input conditions. These results demonstrate that excitatory microstructural changes - reduced spine density and weakened neck compartmentalization - can elevate neuronal excitability, in addition to the inhibitory deficit which is the biggest known effect. These findings highlight excitatory spine remodeling as another key driver of epileptogenesis. We speculate that extending this analysis will be essential to fully understand circuit-level hyperexcitability and to identify new therapeutic targets.

">Intracortical microstructure profiling: a versatile method for indexing cortical lamination</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical microstructure profiling represents a powerful, scalable approach for investigating the laminar organisation of the human cortex on both in vivo and post-mortem datasets. Building upon a long tradition of histological analysis, this method leverages surface-based intracortical sampling to generate profiles of tissue properties across cortical depths. The present work outlines a standardised workflow for intracortical microstructural profiling, newly packaged as an open-source toolbox "CortPro" (https://github.com/caseypaquola/cortpro). Here, we explore the utility of central moments as descriptors of profile shape. Using these measures, we quantify (i) the extent to which in vivo MRI can capture laminar differentiation, (ii) the test-retest reliability of profiles, and (iii) their replicability across sites and studies. Our results demonstrate that intracortical profiles are remarkably robust and effectively mitigate bias-field related limitations of non-quantitative MRI. As applications of microstructure-sensitive imaging expand across development, aging, and disease, microstructure profiling provides a principled means of linking microstructural neuroanatomy with systems-level brain organisation.

Alpha activity is implicated in selecting relevant stimuli, while theta band activity is key in reconfiguring perception-action associations during response inhibition. Increased directed connectivity towards the superior/middle frontal gyrus during response inhibition suggests its involvement in implementing inhibitory control. Notably, there was a directed flow of information from theta to alpha band activity within the insular cortex when cognitive control demands were elevated.

Previous research has related such events to neural states: temporally and regionally specific stable patterns of brain activity.

To do so, we used intracranial measurements with high temporal resolution while subjects were watching a movie. As this is the first study of neural states in intracranial data in the context of event segmentation, we also investigated whether known properties of neural states could be replicated. The neural state boundaries indeed aligned with stimulus features and between brain areas. Importantly, we found evidence for top-down propagation of neural state boundaries at the onsets and offsets of clauses. Interestingly, we did not observe a consistent top-down or bottom-up propagation in general across all timepoints, suggesting that neural state boundaries could propagate in both a top-down and bottom-up manner, with the direction depending on the stimulus input at that moment.

Method A systematic literature review was conducted exploring the evolution of the state-of-the-art databases in Scopus, WOS and Dimensions, involving a relevant selection of empirical studies on the effectiveness of urban planning on citizen satisfaction, using quality criteria and the application of the PRISMA diagram. Results The findings in the various empirical contributions find converging in three main blocks the contributions related to: (i) Urban planning as a catalyst for the impact of citizen satisfaction, given that using the planning tool will lead to the development of local policies based on the Neoliberalism approach for smart urban development; (ii) Theoretical contributions for urban planning that contextualises a modernist planning based on a multidimensional aspect to address quality of life for modern well-being and (iii) Smart planning for citizen satisfaction for the design and implementation of public governance reforms aimed at optimising urban planning management at the local level for smart urban city development. Conclusion There is strong theoretical and empirical support that is closely linked to sustainable development, happiness, public space, urban growth, urban areas, satisfied customers and urban residents. Future research should examine the relative weight of urban planning dimensions and effectiveness in the sustainable development of territories and citizen satisfaction.

                Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels (Phyllanthaceae) is a potential medicinal plant recognized for its sour and tart-tasting fruits. In this study, the chloroplast genome of P. acidus was sequenced, assembled, and characterized. The chloroplast genome size was 156,331 bp, and the overall GC content was 36.9%. Additionally, the chloroplast genome had a quadripartite structure consisting of a large single copy (LSC; 85,807 bp in length; GC content: 34.6%), a small single copy (SSC; 19,262 bp in length; GC content: 30.6%), and two inverted repeat regions (IR; 25,631 bp in length; GC content: 43.1%). A total of 113 unique genes were annotated in the chloroplast genome, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and four rRNAs. The phylogenetic analysis based on 79 protein-coding genes revealed the paraphyly of the Phyllanthus genus. These findings provided additional genetic information for further research on P. acidus and the cp genome in the Phyllanthaceae family.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1125/v1?src=rss">Prepaid Billing System and Customer Satisfaction in Water Service Delivery in Uganda: Evidence from Bushenyi Ishaka Municipality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The adoption of prepaid billing systems by water utilities in developing economies is a significant management initiative. Understanding its impact on customer satisfaction is crucial. This study investigates this impact at Uganda’s National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), grounded in the behavioral beliefs construct of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional design was employed. Data were collected from 261 prepaid water customers in Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipality using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software, with descriptive statistics and linear regression applied to examine the relationship between the prepaid system’s attributes and customer satisfaction. Results The linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between the prepaid system’s attributes and customer satisfaction (B = 0.592, p < 0.05). This confirms that the behavioral beliefs associated with the prepaid system, as per the TPB, are significant predictors of customer satisfaction. The regression model explains 15.3% of the variance in satisfaction, indicating that other factors not measured in the study also play an influential role. Conclusions The prepaid water billing system significantly enhances customer satisfaction at NWSC by leveraging the principles of transparency and consumer control, as predicted by the TPB. Utility managers should emphasize these benefits and support system implementation with targeted customer education and investment in robust technical infrastructure. This study provides original empirical evidence on the drivers of prepaid water satisfaction in a developing economy and validates the application of the TPB framework in this context.

                Background Oral health is fundamental to general health and well-being, yet it remains a neglected priority in health systems, particularly within the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Oral diseases affect an estimated 330 million people (46.5%) across the region, driven by unaddressed risk factors, inequalities, and weak integration into the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agendas. Despite this high burden, oral health initiatives to address this burden and prioritize the oral research agenda remain limited. This scoping review represents the first comprehensive effort to systematically map and identify the status of Oral Health Research (OHR), including scope, output, and collaboration within the WHO EMR (hereafter, EMR) between 2014 and 2024. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was developed in Ovid MEDLINE and translated into Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos, and will be applied to global and regional databases. Searching covers January 2014 to December 2024 without language restrictions. Eligible studies will include primary and secondary research covering clinical, public health, and health systems research. Excluded will be in vitro, in vivo, case reports, protocols, editorials, and commentaries. Screening and data extraction will be managed using DistillerSR software. Extracted data will be analyzed in RStudio, using descriptive statistics, collaboration mapping, and interactive visualization. Discussion This scoping review will provide the first comprehensive mapping of OHR across the EMR. The review will highlight oral health research strengths and gaps at regional and country-specific levels by examining research topics, study designs, funding sources, and collaboration patterns. These findings will guide policymakers, researchers, and academic schools and institutions to prioritize the OHR agenda and inform the development and enactment of oral health policies. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference abstracts, and regional interest-holders engagement. Registration The protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MXWKC.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

Taste peptides have emerged as promising natural flavoring agents attributed to their unique organoleptic properties, high safety profile, and potential health benefits. However, the <i>de novo</i> identification of taste peptides derived from animal, plant, or microbial sources remains a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, significantly impeding their widespread application in the food industry. In this work, we present TastePepAI, a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for customized taste peptide design and safety assessment. As the key element of this framework, a loss-supervised adaptive variational autoencoder (LA-VAE) is implemented to efficiently optimize the latent representation of sequences during training and facilitate the generation of target peptides with desired taste profiles. Notably, our model incorporates a novel taste-avoidance mechanism, allowing for selective flavor exclusion. Subsequently, our in-house developed toxicity prediction algorithm (SpepToxPred) is integrated in the framework to undergo rigorous safety evaluation of generated peptides. Using this integrated platform, we successfully identified 73 peptides exhibiting sweet, salty, and umami, significantly expanding the current repertoire of taste peptides. This work demonstrates the potential of TastePepAI in accelerating taste peptide discovery for food applications and provides a versatile framework adaptable to broader peptide engineering challenges.

                <p>by Austin Polanco, Mark E. J. Newman</p>

Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective alternative to <i>de novo</i> drug development, but there are millions of potential drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting, achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision almost a thousand times better than chance.

                <p>by Rumeysa Aslıhan Ertürk, Abdullah Asım Emül, Büşra Nur Darendeli-Kiraz, Fatma Zehra Sarı, Mehmet Arif Ergün, Mehmet Baysan</p>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offer detailed and inexpensive identification of the genetic structure of living organisms. The massive data volume necessitates the utilization of advanced computational resources for analyses. However, the rapid accumulation of data and the urgent need for analysis tools have caused the development of imperfect software solutions. Given their immense potential in clinical applications and the recent reproducibility crisis discussions in science and technology, these tools must be thoroughly examined. Typically, NGS data analysis tools are benchmarked under homogeneous conditions, with well-trained personnel and ideal hardware and data environments. However, in the real world, these analyses are done under heterogeneous conditions in terms of computing environments and experience levels. This difference is mostly overlooked, therefore studies that examine NGS workflows generated under various conditions would be highly valuable. Moreover, a detailed assessment of the difficulties faced by the trainees would allow for improved educational programs for better NGS analysis training. Considering these needs, we designed an elective undergraduate bioinformatics course project for computer engineering students at Istanbul Technical University. Students were tasked to perform and compare 12 different somatic variant calling pipelines on the recently published SEQC2 dataset. Upon examining the results, we have realized that despite seeming correct, the final variant lists created by different student groups display a high level of heterogeneity. Notably, the operating systems and installation methods were the most influential factors in variant-calling performance. Here, we present detailed evaluations of our case study and provide insights for better bioinformatics training.

                <p>by Haley V. Goodwin, Nigel S. Atkinson</p>

AlphaFold-Multimer models protein complexes and facilitates protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. Mapping of protein interaction domains and motifs onto the 3D structure can lend credence to the model and provide insight into the function of a given interaction. Furthermore, limiting structure prediction to only the domains and motifs that are likely to interact can reduce the computational demand and produce a higher quality model. To satisfy these needs, we built the Protein-Protein Interaction Identifier (PPI-ID). PPI-ID maps interaction domains and motifs onto molecular structures and filters for those that are sufficiently close to interact. Once an interface is found, PPI-ID labels interacting amino acids. Given only sequences, PPI-ID predicts regions for AlphaFold-Multimer modeling, reporting potential interactions only when each protein has one-half of a paired sequence. Testing with known dimers confirms high accuracy of the tool.

Nitrogen balance is a major challenge for herbivores when consuming a low-nitrogen diet. Gut microbiota-mediated urea nitrogen recycling facilitates protein homeostasis during times of nitrogen deficiency, yet its relevance to wild nonhibernating small mammals remains unclear. Here, through a combination of isotope tracing, metagenomics, targeted short-chain fatty acid analysis, and fecal microbiota transplantation, we investigated the effects of protein restriction in winter on urea nitrogen recycling in plateau pikas (<i>Ochotona curzoniae</i>) of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Hepatic urea-cycle metabolism was downregulated during winter protein restriction, accompanied by increases in beneficial bacteria with ureolytic capacity (such as the genus <i>Alistipes</i>), gut urease activity, and urea transporters, and acetate production, with a consequent increase in nitrogen reincorporation into the pika’s protein pool. Critically, supplementing a low-protein diet with yak fecal microbiota enhanced the ureolytic capacity by increasing <i>Alistipes</i> abundance, revealing a critical mechanism whereby interspecies horizontal microbial transfer between sympatric species enhances host protein homeostasis. Our results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiota in urea nitrogen recycling to maintain protein balance in winter-active herbivorous small mammals and contribute to our understanding of species coexistence and mammalian adaptation to high-altitude environments. Our findings establish that microbiota-driven urea nitrogen recycling is a key adaptive strategy for protein homeostasis in winter-active herbivores. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms of mammalian adaptation to high-altitude environments and the dynamics of interspecies coexistence.

                <p>by Eva Marina Stirnemann, Joëlle Sasse</p>

Root exudates, species-specific metabolites released by plants into the rhizosphere, shape plant nutrient uptake, plant–plant and plant–microbiome interactions. When optimized, such interactions boost the productivity of sustainable agricultural systems such as intercropping and crop rotation. However, why certain combinations of crops are beneficial and others are not, remains unclear. This Essay outlines how optimal crop combinations could be determined, focusing on the molecular interplay of crops and their microbial partners. With an advanced understanding of root exudation and its effects on microbes, new strategies for sustainable farming could be unlocked, reducing reliance on fertilizers and pesticides, and tackling challenges raised by a changing climate.

                <p>by Peng Cui, Kuisong Song, Dimitrios Mariatos-Metaxas, Arturo G. Isla, Teresa Femenia, Iakovos Lazaridis, Konstantinos Meletis, Arvind Kumar, Andreas A. Kardamakis</p>

Models of visual salience detection rely on center–surround interactions, yet it remains unclear how these computations are distributed across retinal, cortical, and subcortical circuits due to their overlapping contributions. Here, we reveal a <i>de novo</i> collicular mechanism for surround suppression by combining patterned optogenetics with whole-cell recordings from individual neurons in the mouse superficial superior colliculus (SCs). Center zones were defined by monosynaptic input from channelrhodopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in collicular midbrain slices. Surround network optoactivation suppressed center responses compared to center-only input. This suppression is excitatory in origin, arising from the withdrawal of center excitation via surround-driven inhibition of local recurrent excitatory circuits, as demonstrated by cell-type-specific <i>trans-</i>synaptic tracing and computational modeling. These findings identify a local circuit mechanism for saliency computation in the SCs, independent of cortical input.

                <p>by Michele Angelo Colombo, Jacopo Favaro, Ezequiel Mikulan, Andrea Pigorini, Flavia Maria Zauli, Ivana Sartori, Piergiorgio d’Orio, Laura Castana, Irene Toldo, Stefano Sartori, Simone Sarasso, Tim Bayne, Anil K. Seth, Marcello Massimini</p>

Hemispherotomy is a neurosurgical procedure for treating refractory epilepsy, which entails disconnecting a significant portion of the cortex, potentially encompassing an entire hemisphere, from its cortical and subcortical connections. While this intervention prevents the spread of seizures, it raises important questions. Given the complete isolation from sensory-motor pathways, it remains unclear whether the disconnected cortex retains any form of inaccessible awareness. More broadly, the activity patterns that large portions of the deafferented cortex can sustain in awake humans remain poorly understood. We address these questions by exploring for the first time the electroencephalographic (EEG) state of the isolated cortex during wakefulness before and after surgery in 10 pediatric patients, focusing on non-epileptic background activity. Post-surgery, the isolated cortex exhibited prominent slow oscillations (<2 Hz) and a steeper broad-band spectral decay, reflecting a redistribution of power toward lower frequencies. This broad-band EEG slowing resulted in a marked decrease of the spectral exponent, a validated consciousness marker, reaching values characteristic of deep anesthesia and the vegetative state. When compared with a reference pediatric sample across the sleep–wake cycle, the spectral exponent of the contralateral cortex aligned with wakefulness, whereas that of the isolated cortex was consistent with deep NREM sleep. The findings of prominent slow oscillations and broad-band slowing provisionally support inferences of absent or reduced awareness in the isolated cortex. Moreover, the persistence of unihemispheric sleep-like patterns years after surgery provides unique insights into the long-term electrophysiological effects of cortical disconnections in the human brain.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aging is associated with changes in spatial memory and navigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet fully understood. Environmental boundaries are among the most salient and reliable spatial cues, supporting both spatial memory and orientation. Here, we investigated how aging affects the use and the neural representation of boundary information during a virtual object location memory task. Healthy young and older adults navigated a square virtual environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, allowing us to assess moment-to-moment encoding of distance to environmental boundaries in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Behaviorally, both age groups showed more accurate memory for objects located near boundaries, but this effect was amplified in older adults, whose spatial precision declined more steeply with increasing distance from boundaries. Older adults also exhibited a stronger bias to recall objects closer to boundaries. Analysis of navigation behavior revealed that older adults followed boundary-oriented paths regardless of target location, whereas young adults flexibly adapted their navigation based on spatial context. Neurally, older adults—but not young adults—showed significant blood-oxygen-level-dependent modulation by boundary distance in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, with activity decreasing as participants moved farther from boundaries. This effect was most pronounced in low-performing older adults and was associated with stronger behavioral boundary bias, suggesting a maladaptive reliance on proximity-based cues. Together, our results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that aging alters the use and representation of boundary information, with downstream effects on spatial memory. Altered boundary processing may represent a key mechanism contributing to age-related declines in spatial cognition.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this commentary, I recount my personal research journey that brought me to studying the hippocampus, which I vigorously avoided earlier in my career. I focus on studies of contextual fear conditioning and how they led me in this direction. The adventure was largely unplanned and driven by several findings that were unanticipated when the experiments were initially designed. Because I sometimes chose not to publish the studies in the order that they were completed, and journals have variable publication lags, the discovery process is not immediately apparent from reading the literature in the order that things were published. In a general sense, the chronology shows how well-established ideas may obscure discovery, but a readiness to abandon and replace them when the data lead you elsewhere is a catalyst to better understanding. In this case, that understanding is what makes a context a unique stimulus and why we need the hippocampus to deal with that uniqueness.</p>

     alt="Immunohistochemical Profile of a Conspicuously Organized Structure in the Dorsal Forebrain of the Peacock Gudgeon, Tateurndina ocellicauda"/>
<p>In the dorsal telencephalon of gobiiform fishes, there is a conspicuously organized structure, consisting of readily identifiable subregions that are surrounded by layers of cell bodies. Using immunohistochemistry against several antigen targets in this structure, we demonstrate that each of these subregions is characterized by its own individual neurochemical profile, which indicates corresponding differential inputs into different subregions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the pallium of mammals and reptiles, layered neuronal organizations appear as a key feature to facilitate neuronal processing. Such layered organizations allow to segregate inputs and information processing into different neuronal compartments and are used in a variety of tasks, including multisensory integration and the formation/retrieval of memories. Although teleost fishes also need to process multisensory information and form memories, their pallium generally does not contain any layered structures. Instead, neurons appear to be organized into nuclei with loosely arranged cells. One exception to this general principle can be found in gobiiform fishes: Their caudo-dorsal telencephalon is, in part, marked by neurons, which are organized into several soma-dense and fiber-rich subregions, which are referred to as Dl4–Dl7 in lateral to medial order. To better understand the organization of this structure, we investigated the immunoreactivity of these subregions using a variety of different antigen targets: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), parvalbumin (PV), substance P (SP), calretinin (calret), neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our results reveal a differential distribution of the investigated antigens throughout the subregions, with immunoreactivity hotspots of dense putative terminal fields in different fiber-rich subregions, depending on the antigen investigated. Within Dl7, dense fiber fields were most immunoreactive for calret and PV, within Dl6 for PV, SP, and NFH, within Dl5 for ChAT, and within Dl4 for calret. This differential distribution shows that individual subregions receive input from different sources, which, in turn, suggests that they are different functional compartments.</p>

                Majumdar, Ashcroft, Fritsche, et al. show that neuronal representations of economic decision variables—expected value and risk—exhibit distinct spatial gradients across the mouse frontal cortex. Furthermore, the encoding of these variables depends on where frontal neurons project. The findings reveal a structured, multi-scale code for economic decision variables.

This difference is induced by dietary vitamin A and amplified by the microbiota.

                Ghose et al. perform multi-temperature deep mutational scanning to provide a comprehensive accounting of variants with altered temperature-dependent behavior in a model kinase, challenging previous assumptions surrounding temperature sensitivity and adaptation. Heat-sensitive variants were distributed across the protein structure and affected expression, whereas heat-resistant variants showed increased enzymatic activity, not stability.

                Rahaman et al. show that heat shock leads to monosome accumulation without a corresponding increase in monosome-associated mRNAs, indicating that most monosomes are silent rather than elongation paused. This reduces the median rate of mRNA association with ribosomes, except for mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins, which maintain steady association.

              <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03033-1">Electrons herald non-classical light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 16 October 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03033-1">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03033-1</a></p>When free electrons emit light, an entangled electron–photon state is created. Here measurements of the correlated multiparticle system have been used to produce non-classical photonic states.
