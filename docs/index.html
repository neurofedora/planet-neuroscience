                Mitochondrial adrenodoxins (ADXs) are small iron–sulfur proteins with electron transfer properties. In animals, ADXs transfer electrons between an adrenodoxin reductase (ADXR) and mitochondrial P450s, which is crucial for steroidogenesis. Here we show that a plant mitochondrial steroidogenic pathway, dependent on an ADXR–ADX–P450 shuttle, is essential for female gametogenesis and early...

<p>The human amygdala and hippocampus are critically involved in various processes in face perception. However, it remains unclear how task demands or evaluative contexts modulate processes underlying face perception. In this study, we employed two task instructions when participants viewed the same faces and recorded single-neuron activity from the human amygdala and hippocampus. We comprehensively analyzed task modulation for three key aspects of face processing and we found that neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus (1) encoded high-level social traits such as perceived facial trustworthiness and dominance and this response was modulated by task instructions; (2) encoded low-level facial features and demonstrated region-based feature coding, which was not modulated by task instructions; and (3) encoded fixations on salient face parts such as the eyes and mouth, which was not modulated by task instructions. Together, our results provide a comprehensive survey of task modulation of neural processes underlying face perception at the single-neuron level in the human amygdala and hippocampus.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In <I>Drosophila</I>, molecular pathways affecting longevity have been extensively studied. However, corresponding neurophysiological changes underlying aging-related functional and behavioral deteriorations remain to be fully explored. We examined different motor circuits in <I>Drosophila</I> across the life span and uncovered distinctive age-resilient and age-vulnerable trajectories in their established functional properties. In the giant fiber (GF) and downstream circuit elements responsible for the jump-and-flight escape reflex, we observed relatively mild deterioration toward the end of the life span. In contrast, more substantial age-dependent modifications were seen in the plasticity of GF afferent processing, specifically in use dependence and habituation properties. In addition, there were profound changes in different afferent circuits that drive flight motoneuron activities, including flight pattern generation and seizure spike discharges evoked by electroconvulsive stimulation. Importantly, in high-temperature (HT)-reared flies (29&deg;C), the general trends in these age-dependent trajectories were largely maintained, albeit over a compressed time scale, lending support for the common practice of HT rearing for expediting <I>Drosophila</I> aging studies. We discovered that shortened life spans in <I>Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase</I> (<I>Sod</I>) mutant flies were accompanied by altered aging trajectories in motor circuit properties distinct from those in HT-reared flies, highlighting differential effects of oxidative versus temperature stressors. This work helps to identify several age-vulnerable neurophysiological parameters that may serve as quantitative indicators for assessing genetic and environmental influences on aging progression in <I>Drosophila</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">D1/D5 Dopamine Receptors and mGluR5 Jointly Enable Non-Hebbian Long-Term Potentiation at Sensory Synapses onto Lamina I Spinoparabrachial Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Highly correlated firing of primary afferent inputs and lamina I projection neurons evokes synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism by which ascending nociceptive transmission can be amplified at the level of the spinal dorsal horn. However, the degree to which neuromodulatory signaling shapes the temporal window governing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at sensory synapses onto projection neurons remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that activation of spinal D1/D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) creates a highly permissive environment for the production of LTP in male and female adult mouse spinoparabrachial neurons by promoting non-Hebbian plasticity. Bath application of the mixed D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 unmasked LTP at STDP pairing intervals that normally fail to alter synaptic efficacy. Furthermore, during D1/D5R signaling, action potential discharge in projection neurons became dispensable for LTP generation, and primary afferent stimulation alone was sufficient to induce strengthening of sensory synapses. This non-Hebbian LTP was blocked by the D1/D5R antagonist SCH 39166 or genetic deletion of D5R, and required activation of mGluR5 and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but was independent of NMDAR activation. D1/D5R-enabled non-Hebbian plasticity was observed across multiple neuronal subpopulations in the superficial dorsal horn but was more prevalent in spinoparabrachial neurons than interneurons. Interestingly, the ability of neonatal tissue damage to promote non-Hebbian LTP in adult projection neurons was not observed in D5R knock-out mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that joint spinal D1/D5R and mGluR5 activation can allow unfettered potentiation of sensory synapses onto the output neurons responsible for conveying pain and itch information to the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic LTP in spinal projection neurons has been implicated in the generation of chronic pain. Under normal conditions, plasticity at sensory synapses onto adult mouse spinoparabrachial neurons follows strict Hebbian learning rules, requiring coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic firing. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of spinal D1/D5Rs promotes a switch from Hebbian to non-Hebbian LTP so that primary afferent stimulation alone is sufficient to evoke LTP in the absence of action potential discharge in projection neurons, which required joint activation of mGluR5 and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but not NMDARs. These results suggest that D1/D5Rs cooperate with mGluR5 receptors in the spinal dorsal horn to powerfully influence the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission to the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Embryonic Pericytes Promote Microglial Homeostasis and Their Effects on Neural Progenitors in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multifaceted microglial functions in the developing brain, such as promoting the differentiation of neural progenitors and contributing to the positioning and survival of neurons, have been progressively revealed. Although previous studies have noted the relationship between vascular endothelial cells and microglia in the developing brain, little attention has been given to the importance of pericytes, the mural cells surrounding endothelial cells. In this study, we attempted to dissect the role of pericytes in microglial distribution and function in developing mouse brains. Our immunohistochemical analysis showed that approximately half of the microglia attached to capillaries in the cerebral walls. Notably, a magnified observation of the position of microglia, vascular endothelial cells and pericytes demonstrated that microglia were preferentially associated with pericytes that covered 79.8% of the total capillary surface area. Through <I>in vivo</I> pericyte depletion induced by the intraventricular administration of a neutralizing antibody against platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)&beta; (clone APB5), we found that microglial density was markedly decreased compared with that in control antibody-treated brains because of their low proliferative capacity. Moreover, <I>in vitro</I> coculture of isolated CD11b<sup>+</sup> microglia and NG2<sup>+</sup>PDGFR&alpha;<sup>&ndash;</sup> cells, which are mostly composed of pericytes, from parenchymal cells indicated that pericytes promote microglial proliferation via the production of soluble factors. Furthermore, pericyte depletion by APB5 treatment resulted in a failure of microglia to promote the differentiation of neural stem cells into intermediate progenitors. Taken together, our findings suggest that pericytes facilitate microglial homeostasis in the developing brains, thereby indirectly supporting microglial effects on neural progenitors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study highlights the novel effect of pericytes on microglia in the developing mouse brain. Through multiple analyses using an <I>in vivo</I> pericyte depletion mouse model and an <I>in vitro</I> coculture study of isolated pericytes and microglia from parenchymal cells, we demonstrated that pericytes contribute to microglial proliferation and support microglia in efficiently promoting the differentiation of neural stem cells into intermediate progenitors. Our present data provide evidence that pericytes function not only in the maintenance of cerebral microcirculation and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity but also in microglial homeostasis in the developing cerebral walls. These findings will expand our knowledge and help elucidate the mechanism of brain development both in healthy and disease conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Existence of Functional Connectome Fingerprint during Infancy and Its Stability over Months</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functional connectome fingerprint is a cluster of individualized brain functional connectivity patterns that are capable of distinguishing one individual from others. Although its existence has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults, whether such individualized patterns exist during infancy is barely investigated despite its importance in identifying the origin of the intrinsic connectome patterns that potentially mirror distinct behavioral phenotypes. To fill this knowledge gap, capitalizing on a longitudinal high-resolution structural and resting-state functional MRI dataset with 104 human infants (53 females) with 806 longitudinal scans (age, 16&ndash;876 d) and infant-specific functional parcellation maps, we observe that the brain functional connectome fingerprint may exist since infancy and keeps stable over months during early brain development. Specifically, we achieve an ~78% individual identification rate by using ~5% selected functional connections, compared with the best identification rate of 60% without connection selection. The frontoparietal networks recognized as the most contributive networks in adult functional connectome fingerprinting retain their superiority in infants despite being widely acknowledged as rapidly developing systems during childhood. The existence and stability of the functional connectome fingerprint are further validated on adjacent age groups. Moreover, we show that the infant frontoparietal networks can reach similar accuracy in predicting individual early learning composite scores as the whole-brain connectome, again resembling the observations in adults and highlighting the relevance of functional connectome fingerprint to cognitive performance. For the first time, these results suggest that each individual may retain a unique and stable marker of functional connectome during early brain development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional connectome fingerprinting during infancy featuring rapid brain development remains almost uninvestigated even though it is essential for understanding the early individual-level intrinsic pattern of functional organization and its relationship with distinct behavioral phenotypes. With an infant-tailored functional connection selection and validation strategy, we strive to provide the delineation of the infant functional connectome fingerprint by examining its existence, stability, and relationship with early cognitive performance. We observe that the brain functional connectome fingerprint may exist since early infancy and remains stable over months during the first 2 years. The identified key contributive functional connections and networks for fingerprinting are also verified to be highly predictive for cognitive score prediction, which reveals the association between infant connectome fingerprint and cognitive performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuregulin 1 and ErbB4 Kinase Actively Regulate Sharp Wave Ripples in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sharp wave ripples (SW-Rs) in the hippocampus are synchronized bursts of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PyNs), critical for spatial working memory. However, the molecular underpinnings of SW-Rs remain poorly understood. We show that SW-Rs in hippocampal slices from both male and female mice were suppressed by neuregulin 1 (NRG1), an epidermal growth factor whose expression is enhanced by neuronal activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ErbB4, a receptor tyrosine kinase for NRG1, increases SW-R occurrence rate in hippocampal slices. These results suggest an important role of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in regulating SW-Rs. To further test this notion, we characterized SW-Rs in freely moving male mice, chemical genetic mutant mice, where ErbB4 can be specifically inhibited by the bulky inhibitor 1NMPP1. Remarkably, SW-R occurrence was increased by 1NMPP1. We found that 1NMPP1 increased the firing rate of PyN neurons, yet disrupted PyN neuron dynamics during SW-R events. Furthermore, 1NMPP1 increased SW-R occurrence during both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep states and wake states with a greater impact on SW-Rs during wake states. In accord, spatial working memory was attenuated in male mice. Together these results indicate that dynamic activity of ErbB4 kinase is critical to SW-Rs and spatial working memory. This study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of SW-Rs and a novel function of the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sharp wave ripples (SW-Rs) are a hippocampal event, important for memory functioning. Yet the molecular pathways that regulate SW-Rs remain unclear. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), previously known to be increased in pyramidal neuron's (PyNs) in an activity dependent manner, signals to its receptor, ErbB4 kinase, that is in important regulator of GABAergic transmission and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that SW-Rs are regulated by this signaling pathway in a dynamic manner. Not only so, we show that this signaling pathway is dynamically needed for spatial working memory. These data suggest a molecular signaling pathway, NRG1-ErbB4, that regulates an important network event of the hippocampus, SW-Rs, that underlies memory functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroendocrine Stress Axis-Dependence of Duloxetine Analgesia (Anti-Hyperalgesia) in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). While it is only effective in little more than half of patients, our ability to predict patient response remains incompletely understood. Given that stress exacerbates CIPN, and that the therapeutic effect of duloxetine is thought to be mediated, at least in part, via its effects on adrenergic mechanisms, we evaluated the contribution of neuroendocrine stress axes, sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, to the effect of duloxetine in preclinical models of oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced CIPN. Systemic administration of duloxetine, which alone had no effect on nociceptive threshold, both prevented and reversed mechanical hyperalgesia associated with oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-CIPN. It more robustly attenuated oxaliplatin CIPN in male rats, while it was more effective for paclitaxel CIPN in females. Gonadectomy attenuated these sex differences in the effect of duloxetine. To assess the role of neuroendocrine stress axes in the effect of duloxetine on CIPN, rats of both sexes were submitted to adrenalectomy combined with fixed level replacement of corticosterone and epinephrine. While CIPN, in these rats, was of similar magnitude to that observed in adrenal-intact animals, rats of neither sex responded to duloxetine. Furthermore, duloxetine blunted an increase in corticosterone induced by oxaliplatin, and prevented the exacerbation of CIPN by sound stress. Our results demonstrate a role of neuroendocrine stress axes in duloxetine analgesia (anti-hyperalgesia) for the treatment of CIPN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating dose-dependent and therapy-limiting side effect of many of the cytostatic drugs used to treat cancer (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Argyriou et al., 2010</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Marmiroli et al., 2017</cross-ref>). Duloxetine is the only treatment for CIPN currently recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">Hershman et al., 2014</cross-ref>). In the present study, focused on elucidating mechanisms mediating the response of oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy to duloxetine, we demonstrate a major contribution to its effect of neuroendocrine stress axis function. These findings, which parallel the clinical observation that stress may impact response of CIPN to duloxetine (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B76">Taylor et al., 2007</cross-ref>), open new approaches to the treatment of CIPN and other stress-associated pain syndromes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Representations of Tonotopy and Pitch in Human Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frequency-to-place mapping, or tonotopy, is a fundamental organizing principle throughout the auditory system, from the earliest stages of auditory processing in the cochlea to subcortical and cortical regions. Although cortical maps are referred to as tonotopic, it is unclear whether they simply reflect a mapping of physical frequency inherited from the cochlea, a computation of pitch based on the fundamental frequency, or a mixture of these two features. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure BOLD responses as male and female human participants listened to pure tones that varied in frequency or complex tones that varied in either spectral content (brightness) or fundamental frequency (pitch). Our results reveal evidence for pitch tuning in bilateral regions that partially overlap with the traditional tonotopic maps of spectral content. In general, primary regions within Heschl's gyri (HGs) exhibited more tuning to spectral content, whereas areas surrounding HGs exhibited more tuning to pitch.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tonotopy, an orderly mapping of frequency, is observed throughout the auditory system. However, it is not known whether the tonotopy observed in the cortex simply reflects the frequency spectrum (as in the ear) or instead represents the higher-level feature of fundamental frequency, or pitch. Using carefully controlled stimuli and high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we separated these features to study their cortical representations. Our results suggest that tonotopy in primary cortical regions is driven predominantly by frequency, but also reveal evidence for tuning to pitch in regions that partially overlap with the tonotopic gradients but extend into nonprimary cortical areas. In addition to resolving ambiguities surrounding cortical tonotopy, our findings provide evidence that selectivity for pitch is distributed bilaterally throughout auditory cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Increased Connectivity among Sensory and Motor Regions during Visual and Audiovisual Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday conversation, we usually process the talker's face as well as the sound of the talker's voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is degraded. Here, we used fMRI to monitor brain activity while adult humans (<I>n</I> = 60) were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, and audiovisual words. The audiovisual words were presented in quiet and in several signal-to-noise ratios. As expected, audiovisual speech perception recruited both auditory and visual cortex, with some evidence for increased recruitment of premotor cortex in some conditions (including in substantial background noise). We then investigated neural connectivity using psychophysiological interaction analysis with seed regions in both primary auditory cortex and primary visual cortex. Connectivity between auditory and visual cortices was stronger in audiovisual conditions than in unimodal conditions, including a wide network of regions in posterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis on the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), implicated in many previous studies of audiovisual speech perception. We found evidence for both activity and effective connectivity in pSTS for visual-only and audiovisual speech, although these were not significant in whole-brain analyses. Together, our results suggest a prominent role for cross-region synchronization in understanding both visual-only and audiovisual speech that complements activity in integrative brain regions like pSTS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In everyday conversation, we usually process the talker's face as well as the sound of the talker's voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is hard to understand (e.g., background noise). Prior work has suggested that specialized regions of the brain may play a critical role in integrating information from visual and auditory speech. Here, we show a complementary mechanism relying on synchronized brain activity among sensory and motor regions may also play a critical role. These findings encourage reconceptualizing audiovisual integration in the context of coordinated network activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior-Posterior Hippocampal Dynamics Support Working Memory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is a locus of working memory (WM) with anterior and posterior subregions that differ in their transcriptional and external connectivity patterns. However, the involvement and functional connections between these subregions in WM processing are poorly understood. To address these issues, we recorded intracranial EEG from the anterior and the posterior hippocampi in humans (seven females and seven males) who maintained a set of letters in their WM. We found that WM maintenance was accompanied by elevated low-frequency activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus and by increased theta/alpha band (3&ndash;12 Hz) phase synchronization between anterior and posterior subregions. Cross-frequency and Granger prediction analyses consistently showed that the correct WM trials were associated with theta/alpha band-coordinated unidirectional influence from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus. In contrast, WM errors were associated with bidirectional interactions between the anterior and posterior hippocampus. These findings imply that theta/alpha band synchrony within the hippocampus may support successful WM via a posterior to anterior influence. A combination of intracranial recording and a fine-grained atlas may be of value in understanding the neural mechanisms of WM processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Working memory (WM) is crucial to everyday functioning. The hippocampus has been proposed to be a subcortical node involved in WM processes. Previous studies have suggested that the anterior and posterior hippocampi differ in their external connectivity patterns and gene expression. However, it remains unknown whether and how human hippocampal subregions are recruited and coordinated during WM tasks. Here, by recording intracranial electroencephalography simultaneously from both hippocampal subregions, we found enhanced power in both areas and increased phase synchronization between them. Furthermore, correct WM trials were associated with a unidirectional influence from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus, whereas error trials were correlated with bidirectional interactions. These findings indicate a long-axis specialization in the human hippocampus during WM processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decreasing Alertness Modulates Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to make decisions based on external information, prior knowledge, and evidence is a crucial aspect of cognition and may determine the success and survival of an organism. Despite extensive work on decision-making mechanisms/models, understanding the effects of alertness on neural and cognitive processes remain limited. Here we use EEG and behavioral modeling to characterize cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in awake/low alertness periods in humans (14 male, 18 female) and characterize the compensatory mechanisms as alertness decreases. Well-rested human participants, changing between full-wakefulness and low alertness, performed an auditory tone-localization task, and its behavioral dynamics were quantified with psychophysics, signal detection theory, and drift-diffusion modeling, revealing slower reaction times, inattention to the left side of space, and a lower rate of evidence accumulation in periods of low alertness. Unconstrained multivariate pattern analysis (decoding) showed a ~280 ms delayed onset driven by low alertness of the neural signatures differentiating between left and right decision, with a spatial reconfiguration from centroparietal to lateral frontal regions 150-360 ms. To understand the neural compensatory mechanisms with decreasing alertness, we connected the evidence-accumulation behavioral parameter to the neural activity, showing in the early periods (125-325 ms) a shift in the associated patterns from right parietal regions in awake, to right frontoparietal during low alertness. This change in the neurobehavioral dynamics for central accumulation-related cognitive processes defines a clear reconfiguration of the brain networks' regions and dynamics needed for the implementation of decision-making, revealing mechanisms of resilience of cognition when challenged by decreased alertness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most living organisms make multiple daily decisions, and these require a degree of evidence from both the environment and the internal milieu. Such decisions are usually studied under sequential sampling models and involve making a behavioral choice based on sensory encoding, central accumulation, and motor implementation processes. Since there is little research on how decreasing alertness affects such cognitive processes, this study has looked at the cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making in people while fully awake and in drowsy periods. Using computational modeling of behavior and neural dynamics on human participants performing an auditory tone-localization task, we reveal how low alertness modulates evidence accumulation-related processes and its corresponding compensatory neural signatures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurocomputational Underpinnings of Expected Surprise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predictive coding accounts of brain functions profoundly influence current approaches to perceptual synthesis. However, a fundamental paradox has emerged, that may be very relevant for understanding hallucinations, psychosis, or cognitive inflexibility: in some situations, surprise or prediction error-related responses can decrease when predicted, and yet, they can increase when we know they are predictable. This paradox is resolved by recognizing that brain responses reflect precision-weighted prediction error. This presses us to disambiguate the contributions of precision and prediction error in electrophysiology. To meet this challenge for the first time, we appeal to a methodology that couples an original experimental paradigm with fine dynamic modeling. We examined brain responses in healthy human participants (<I>N</I> = 20; 10 female) to unexpected and expected surprising sounds, assuming that the latter yield a smaller prediction error but much more amplified by a larger precision weight. Importantly, addressing this modulation requires the modeling of trial-by-trial variations of brain responses, that we reconstructed within a fronto-temporal network by combining EEG and MEG. Our results reveal an adaptive learning of surprise with larger integration of past (relevant) information in the context of expected surprises. Within the auditory hierarchy, this adaptation was found tied down to specific connections and reveals in particular precision encoding through neuronal excitability. Strikingly, these fine processes are automated as sound sequences were unattended. These findings directly speak to applications in psychiatry, where specifically impaired precision weighting has been suggested to be at the heart of several conditions such as schizophrenia and autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In perception as Bayesian inference and learning, context sensitivity expresses as the precision weighting of prediction errors. A subtle mechanism that is thought to lie at the heart of several psychiatric conditions. It is thus critical to identify its neurophysiological and computational underpinnings. We revisit the passive auditory oddball paradigm by manipulating sound predictability and use a twofold modeling approach to simultaneous EEG-MEG recordings: (1) trial-by-trial modeling of cortical responses reveals a context-sensitive perceptual learning process; (2) the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of evoked responses uncovers the associated changes in synaptic efficacy. Predictability discloses a link between precision weighting and self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, a result that paves the way to a fine description of healthy and pathologic perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preservation of Eye Movements in Parkinson's Disease Is Stimulus- and Task-Specific</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that includes motor impairments, such as tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Although eye movement deficits are commonly found in saccade and pursuit tasks, preservation of oculomotor function has also been reported. Here we investigate specific task and stimulus conditions under which oculomotor function in PD is preserved. Sixteen PD patients and 18 healthy, age-matched controls completed a battery of movement tasks that included stationary or moving targets eliciting reactive or deliberate eye movements: pro-saccades, anti-saccades, visually guided pursuit, and rapid go/no-go manual interception. Compared with controls, patients demonstrated systematic impairments in tasks with stationary targets: pro-saccades were hypometric and anti-saccades were incorrectly initiated toward the cued target in ~35% of trials compared with 14% errors in controls. In patients, task errors were linked to short latency saccades, indicating abnormalities in inhibitory control. However, patients' eye movements in response to dynamic targets were relatively preserved. PD patients were able to track and predict a disappearing moving target and make quick go/no-go decisions as accurately as controls. Patients' interceptive hand movements were slower on average but initiated earlier, indicating adaptive processes to compensate for motor slowing. We conclude that PD patients demonstrate stimulus and task dependency of oculomotor impairments, and we propose that preservation of eye and hand movement function in PD is linked to a separate functional pathway through the superior colliculus-brainstem loop that bypasses the fronto-basal ganglia network. Our results demonstrate that studying oculomotor and hand movement function in PD can support disease diagnosis and further our understanding of disease progression and dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Eye movements are a promising clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis of movement disorders and to monitor disease progression. Although Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show some oculomotor abnormalities, it is not clear whether previously described eye movement impairments are task-specific. We assessed eye movements in PD under different visual (stationary vs moving targets) and movement (reactive vs deliberate) conditions. We demonstrate that PD patients are able to accurately track moving objects but make inaccurate eye movements toward stationary targets. The preservation of eye movements toward dynamic stimuli might enable patients to accurately act on the predicted motion path of the moving target. These results can inform the development of tools for the rehabilitation or maintenance of functional performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Do You Feel the Rhythm: Dynamic Motor-Auditory Interactions Are Involved in the Imagination of Hierarchical Timing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predicting and organizing patterns of events is important for humans to survive in a dynamically changing world. The motor system has been proposed to be actively, and necessarily, engaged in not only the production but the perception of rhythm by organizing hierarchical timing that influences auditory responses. It is not yet well understood how the motor system interacts with the auditory system to perceive and maintain hierarchical structure in time. This study investigated the dynamic interaction between auditory and motor functional sources during the perception and imagination of musical meters. We pursued this using a novel method combining high-density EEG, EMG, and motion capture with independent component analysis to separate motor and auditory activity during meter imagery while robustly controlling against covert movement. We demonstrated that endogenous brain activity in both auditory and motor functional sources reflects the imagination of binary and ternary meters in the absence of corresponding acoustic cues or overt movement at the meter rate. We found clear evidence for hypothesized motor-to-auditory information flow at the beat rate in all conditions, suggesting a role for top-down influence of the motor system on auditory processing of beat-based rhythms, and reflecting an auditory-motor system with tight reciprocal informational coupling. These findings align with and further extend a set of motor hypotheses from beat perception to hierarchical meter imagination, adding supporting evidence to active engagement of the motor system in auditory processing, which may more broadly speak to the neural mechanisms of temporal processing in other human cognitive functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans live in a world full of hierarchically structured temporal information, the accurate perception of which is essential for understanding speech and music. Music provides a window into the brain mechanisms of time perception, enabling us to examine how the brain groups musical beats into, for example a march or waltz. Using a novel paradigm combining measurement of electrical brain activity with data-driven analysis, this study directly investigates motor-auditory connectivity during meter imagination. Findings highlight the importance of the motor system in the active imagination of meter. This study sheds new light on a fundamental form of perception by demonstrating how auditory-motor interaction may support hierarchical timing processing, which may have clinical implications for speech and motor rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Theta-Burst Stimulation of Primary Afferents Drives Long-Term Potentiation in the Spinal Cord and Persistent Pain via {alpha}2{delta}-1-Bound NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the spinal dorsal horn reflect activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and central sensitization in chronic pain. Tetanic high-frequency stimulation is commonly used to induce LTP in the spinal cord. However, primary afferent nerves often display low-frequency, rhythmic bursting discharges in painful conditions. Here, we determined how theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of primary afferents impacts spinal cord synaptic plasticity and nociception in male and female mice. We found that TBS induced more LTP, whereas tetanic stimulation induced more LTD, in mouse spinal lamina II neurons. TBS triggered LTP, but not LTD, in 50% of excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2). By contrast, TBS induced LTD and LTP in 12&ndash;16% of vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-expressing inhibitory neurons. Nerve injury significantly increased the prevalence of TBS-induced LTP in VGluT2-expressing, but not VGAT-expressing, lamina II neurons. Blocking NMDARs, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin, or &alpha;2-1 knockout abolished TBS-induced LTP in lamina II neurons. Also, disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with &alpha;2-1Tat peptide prevented TBS-induced LTP in VGluT2-expressing neurons. Furthermore, TBS of the sciatic nerve induced long-lasting allodynia and hyperalgesia in wild-type, but not &alpha;2-1 knockout, mice. TBS significantly increased the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction and synaptic trafficking in the spinal cord. In addition, treatment with NMDAR antagonists, gabapentin, or &alpha;2-1Tat peptide reversed TBS-induced pain hypersensitivity. Therefore, TBS-induced primary afferent input causes a neuropathic pain-like phenotype and LTP predominantly in excitatory dorsal horn neurons via &alpha;2-1-dependent NMDAR activation. &alpha;2-1-bound NMDARs may be targeted for reducing chronic pain development at the onset of tissue/nerve injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal dorsal horn synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of chronic pain. Although sensory nerves display rhythmic bursting discharges at theta frequencies during painful conditions, the significance of this naturally occurring firing activity in the induction of spinal synaptic plasticity is largely unknown. In this study, we found that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of sensory nerves induced LTP mainly in excitatory dorsal horn neurons and that the prevalence of TBS-induced LTP was potentiated by nerve injury. This TBS-driven synaptic plasticity required &alpha;2-1 and its interaction with NMDARs. Furthermore, TBS of sensory nerves induced persistent pain, which was maintained by &alpha;2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, TBS-induced LTP at primary afferent&ndash;dorsal horn neuron synapses is an appropriate cellular model for studying mechanisms of chronic pain.</p>

                Background: Altmetrics measure the impact of journal articles by tracking social media, Wikipedia, public policy documents, blogs, and mainstream news activity, after which an overall Altmetric attention score (AAS) is calculated for every journal article. In this study, we aim to assess the AAS for influenza related articles and its relation to the influenza season in the USA. Methods: This study used the openly available Altmetric data from Altmetric.com. First, we retrieved all influenza-related articles using an advanced PubMed search query, then we inputted the resulted query into Altmetric explorer. We then calculated the average AAS for each month during the years 2012-2018. Results: A total of 24,964 PubMed documents were extracted, among them, 12,395 documents had at least one attention. We found a significant difference in mean AAS between February and each of January and March (p< 0.001, mean difference of 117.4 and 460.7, respectively). We found a significant difference between June and each of May and July (p< 0.001, mean difference of 1221.4 and 162.7, respectively). We also found a significant difference between October and each of September and November (p< 0.001, mean difference of 88.8 and 154.8, respectively). Conclusion: We observed a seasonal trend in the attention toward influenza-related research, with three annual peaks that correlated with the beginning, peak, and end of influenza seasons in the USA, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anomalous energy consumption detection using a Naïve Bayes approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Industrial energy management has emerged as an important component in monitoring energy consumption particularly with the recent trend of migrating towards IR 4.0. The capability to detect anomalies is essential as it serves as a precautionary step for real-time response to mitigate the maximum demand penalty. The purpose of this research was to develop a high accuracy anomalies detection algorithm to identify anomalies in the energy consumption data recorded by a smart meter. Methods: The proposed algorithm utilized supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, namely Isolation Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes.  The data were first labeled by using Isolation Forest to categorize them into normal and abnormal groups. This was followed by Gaussian Naïve Bayes to classify and predict the anomalies of the smart meter reading. Results: These machine learning techniques showed significant accuracy in predicting the anomalies in smart meter readings. The data used were simulated data collected in less than a month with 30-minute reading intervals.  The data were divided into testing and validation sets according to a ratio of 7:3. The balanced accuracy score in predicting anomalies for each different smart meter was above 89%. The average precision, average recall and average F1 score for the normal data were 98%, 99% and 98%, respectively. Whereas the corresponding scores for the abnormal data set were 95%, 90% and 92%. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm is a hybrid approach based on Isolation Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes and it provided satisfactory accuracy in anomaly electricity consumption detection based on smart meter readings. The study presents a quick and simple method for categorizing energy consumption data as normal or abnormal, which assists in automatically labelling vast datasets of energy consumption readings. The proposed approach establishes a fundamental framework for predicting the occurrence of anomalies in the industrial energy management system.

                Background:  Anemia is a severe public health problem affecting more than half of children under five years of age in low-, middle- and high-income countries. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among children under five years of age in northern Tanzania. Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Rombo district, Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania, in April 2016. Multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 602 consenting mothers and their children aged 6-59 months and interviewed using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Stata version 15.1. We used generalized linear models (binomial family and logit link function) with a robust variance estimator to determine factors associated with anemia. Results: Prevalence of anemia was 37.9%, and it was significantly higher among children aged 6-23 months (48.3%) compared to those aged 24-59 months (28.5%). There were no significant differences in anemia prevalence by sex of the child. Adjusted for other factors, children aged 6-23 months had over two times higher odds of being anemic (OR=2.47, 95% CI 1.73, 3.53, p<0.001) compared to those aged 24-59 months. No significant association was found between maternal and nutritional characteristics with anemia among children in this study. Conclusion: Prevalence of anemia was lower than the national and regional estimates, and it still constitutes a significant public health problem, especially among children aged 6-23 months. The study recommends iron supplementation, food fortification, dietary diversification, and management of childhood illnesses interventions for mothers and children under two years.

                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast DNA encoding for the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a passage model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that among SARS-like coronaviruses only the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain information that points to a synthetic passage in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

                Background: The molecular distributions of solutes in binary immiscible solvents as used in partition coefficient technique serve as measures of the solute separation, concentration and beneficiation from contaminants. Methods: The effects of solute interactions on partition coefficient, kD, in selected binary immiscible solvents were investigated at 300C and atmospheric pressure. The activities from the interactions with changes of concentrations within the solvents were analysed. These were done using simple titration method. The solutes were distributed in the binary solvents and the concentrations from the two layers formed were determined by titration method. The interactions of oxalic acid and succinic acid in carbon tetrachloride-water, diethyl ether-water, and n-hexane-water were studied for the partition coefficient values in the respective systems, to determine the nature and degree of the interfering reactions that are affecting the distributions, and to ascertain the best binary solvents from the three systems. Results: Oxalic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0738 in carbon tetrachloride-water with the dimerization constant of -15.7092 and ionization constant of 0.0303. Oxalic acid has the distribution coefficient of 0.0173, dimerization constant of 144.0167 and the ionization constant of 0.0035 in diethyl ether-water. Oxalic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0279, dimerization constant of 20.2798 and ionization constant of 0.0019 in n-hexane-water. Succinic acid has the partition coefficient of -0.05617, dimerization constant of -18.5655 and ionization constant of 0.0284 in carbon tetrachloride-water. In diethyl ether-water, succinic acid has the partition coefficient of 0.0427, dimerization constant of -18.1611 and ionization constant of 0.0332. In n-hexane-water, succinic acid has the partition coefficient of -0.04274, dimerization constant of 71.9491 and ionization constant of 0.0265. Conclusion: From these results, carbon tetrachloride-water is recommended for the purification and extraction of oxalic acid from contaminants. Carbon tetrachloride-water is also the best binary immiscible solvent for succinic acid.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Extended ensemble simulations of a SARS-CoV-2 nsp1–5’-UTR complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shun Sakuraba, Qilin Xie, Kota Kasahara, Junichi Iwakiri, Hidetoshi Kono</p>

Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 180-residue protein that blocks translation of host mRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2’s own RNA evades nsp1’s host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results suggested that the stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5’-untranslated region (SL1) binds to both nsp1’s N-terminal globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The consistency of the results was assessed by modeling nsp1-40<i>S</i> ribosome structure based on reported nsp1 experiments, including the X-ray crystallographic structure analysis, the cryo-EM electron density map, and cross-linking experiments. The SL1 binding region predicted from the simulation was open to the solvent, yet the ribosome could interact with SL1. Cluster analysis of the binding mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses suggest residues Arg124, Lys47, Arg43, and Asn126 may be involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism, consistent with the existing mutational analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution enhances mutational robustness and suppresses the emergence of a new phenotype: A new computational approach for studying evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tadamune Kaneko, Macoto Kikuchi</p>

The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a new computational method to investigate the particularities of evolution. Second, we apply this method to a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and explore the evolution of mutational robustness and bistability. Living systems have developed their functions through evolutionary processes. To understand the particularities of this process theoretically, evolutionary simulation (ES) alone is insufficient because the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. We need a reference system for comparison. An appropriate reference system for this purpose is an ensemble of the randomly sampled genotypes. However, generating high-fitness genotypes by simple random sampling is difficult because such genotypes are rare. In this study, we used the multicanonical Monte Carlo method developed in statistical physics to construct a reference ensemble of GRNs and compared it with the outcomes of ES. We obtained the following results. First, mutational robustness was significantly higher in ES than in the reference ensemble at the same fitness level. Second, the emergence of a new phenotype, bistability, was delayed in evolution. Third, the bistable group of GRNs contains many mutationally fragile GRNs compared with those in the non-bistable group. This suggests that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the mutation-selection mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy in COVID-19 patients globally: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, resulting in pneumonia. Apart from steroids, other anti-COVID drugs that have been studied appear to have little or no effect on COVID-19 pneumonia. There is a well-known history of inflammatory disease, including pneumonia, treated with low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT). It reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), and leukocyte recruitment.   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, with keywords such as “radiotherapy,” “low-dose radiation therapy,” “low-dose irradiation,” “covid-19 pneumonia,” “SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,” and “covid pneumonia.” with additional filters for human studies and customized articles in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We reviewed randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies with a clearly defined intervention, including low-dose radiotherapy alone or in combination with any therapy to treat COVID-19 pneumonia from December 2019 to May 2021. Patients receiving standard or high-dose radiotherapy, including for other diseases, were excluded. Zotero software was used to collect and organize research from various databases, remove duplicates, extract relevant data, and record decisions. Participants’ demographics and baseline status were obtained from the full-text articles along with the intervention’s outcome/effect on patient status.  Results: Four studies with 61 participants that met the inclusion criteria were included. One was a double-blind randomized controlled trial, one a non-randomized trial, while the other two were single-arm clinical trials. Low-dose radiation therapy did not show any significant improvement in COVID-19 patients.  Conclusion: Only two studies included in this review demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory markers; however, patients were also given steroids or other drugs. Therefore, the confounding effects must be considered before drawing conclusions. This systematic review does not support mortality benefit, clinical course improvement, or imaging changes with LDRT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients: a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

Using a data-driven person-specific network connectivity approach, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), we uncovered two subgroups for MID runs. During Run 01, subgroups significantly related to sensation seeking; however, during Run 02 subgroups did not significantly relate to sensation seeking.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent risk-taking, including sensation seeking (SS), is often attributed to developmental changes in connectivity among brain regions implicated in cognitive control and reward processing. Despite considerable scientific and popular interest in this neurodevelopmental framework, there are few empirical investigations of adolescent functional connectivity, let alone examinations of its links to SS behavior. The studies that have been done focus on mean-based approaches and leave unanswered questions about individual differences in neurodevelopment and behavior. The goal of this paper is to take a person-specific approach to the study of adolescent functional connectivity during a continuous motivational state, and to examine links between connectivity and self-reported SS behavior in 104 adolescents (<i>M</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 19.3; <i>SD</i>
<sub>Age</sub> = 1.3). Using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), person-specific connectivity during two neuroimaging runs of a monetary incentive delay task was estimated among 12 a priori brain regions of interest representing reward, cognitive, and salience networks. Two data-driven subgroups were detected, a finding that was consistent between both neuroimaging runs, but associations with SS were only found in the first run, potentially reflecting neural habituation in the second run. Specifically, the subgroup that had unique connections between reward-related regions had greater SS and showed a distinctive relation between connectivity strength in the reward regions and SS. These findings provide novel evidence for heterogeneity in adolescent brain-behavior relations by showing that subsets of adolescents have unique associations between neural motivational processing and SS. Findings have broader implications for future work on reward processing, as they demonstrate that brain-behavior relations may attenuate across runs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The topic of typical sex and gender difference in empathy is examined in both a developmental and neuroscientific perspective. Empathy is construed as a multi-layered phenomenon with various degrees of complexity unfolding in ontogeny. The different components of empathy (i.e., affective, cognitive, and prosocial motivation) will be discussed as they interact and are expressed behaviorally. Significant sex/gender differences in empathy are discussed in relation to putative bottom-up or top-down processes underlying empathetic responses. The early onset and the pervasive presence of such sex/gender differences throughout the lifespan are further discussed in light of social and neurobiological modeling factors, including early socialization, brain's structural/functional variances, as well as genetics and hormonal factors.</p>

<p>Genotype differences in the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) that reduce SERT expression levels significantly alter mitochondrial abundance and gene expression in a brain region and sex-dependent manner.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex conditions attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. There is a growing body of evidence showing that serotonergic signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders and are linked as signaling through specific serotonin (5-HT) receptors drives mitochondrial biogenesis. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is important in these disorders as it regulates synaptic serotonin and therapeutically is the target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which are a major class of anti-depressant drug. Human allelic variants of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) such as the S/S variant, are associated with reduced SERT expression and increased susceptibility for developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Using a rat model that is haploinsufficient for SERT and displays reduced SERT expression similar to the human S/S variant, we demonstrate that reduced SERT expression modulates mitochondrial copy number and expression of respiratory chain electron transfer components in the brain. In the frontal cortex, genotype-related trends were opposing for males and females, such that reduced SERT expression led to increased expression of the Complex I subunit <i>mt-Nd1</i> in males but reduced expression in females. Our findings suggest that SERT expression and serotonergic signaling have a role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the brain. We speculate that the sexual dimorphism in mitochondrial abundance and gene expression contributes to the sex bias found in the incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as MDD and ASD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Female Dark Agouti rats were immunized with increasing doses of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis. Typical EAE motor impairments were assessed daily and noninvasive visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded at baseline and 5 weeks after immunization, with final histopathology of optic nerves (ONs). Immunized rats exhibited a relapsing-remitting clinical course. Both VEP and histological abnormalities were detected in a MOG dose-dependent gradient. Increasing MOG dosage augmented visual function impairment in EAE, which could be monitored with VEP recording to assess demyelination and axonal loss along ONs.</p>

<p>The early chronic melatonin administration modifies the expression of key molecules involved in cognitive process in a male murine transgenic model of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders sharing common features related to impaired social and communication abilities in addition to stereotyped behaviors. ASD patients present encephalic morphological, physiological, and biomolecular alterations with low levels of melatonin due to alterations in its pathways. Therefore, even if ASDs have traditionally been framed as behavioral disorders, several lines of evidence are accumulating that ASDs are characterized by certain anatomical and physiological abnormalities, including oxidative stress and inflammation in peripheral biomarkers, but likewise present in human brain tissue also characterized by alterations in synaptic remodeling and neuromodulation. Melatonin has also protective and antioxidant properties, so we can therefore hypothesize that alterations in melatonin's pathways may be one of the causes of the symptomatology of autism. The aim of the present study was to analyze the beneficial effect induced by melatonin administration and its possible mechanism of action in a transgenic mouse model of autism, immediately after weaning. The male mice were daily treated <i>per os</i> with melatonin (10 mg/Kg/day) or vehicle for 8 weeks starting from the sixth week of life. The antioxidant modulation, the GABAergic/glutamatergic impairment, and the synaptic remodeling in the prefrontal cortex have been evaluated. Social and repetitive behaviors were also evaluated. The behavioral results showed no statistical evidences, instead the immunohistochemical results indicated the ability of melatonin to promote the activity of antioxidant system, the GABAergic/glutamatergic equilibrium, and the synaptic remodeling. The results show that melatonin may be a possible adjuvant therapeutic strategy in ASDs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions whose shared core features are impairments in social interaction and communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The significant and consistent male preponderance in ASD prevalence has historically affected the scientific knowledge of autism in females as regards, inter alia, the clinical presentation, the genetic architecture, and the structural brain underpinnings. Indeed, females with ASD are under-investigated as samples recruited for clinical research typically reflect the strong male bias of the disorder. In the last years, the study of the various aspects of sex/gender (s/g) differences in ASD is gaining increased clinical and research interest resulting in a growing number of investigations on this topic. Here, I review and discuss evidence emerged from epidemiological, clinical, and neuroimaging studies in the last decade focusing on s/g differences in children with ASD. These studies are the prerequisites for the development of assessment and treatment practices which take into consideration s/g differences in ASD. Ultimately, a better understanding of s/g differences aims at improving healthcare for both ASD males and females.</p>

     alt="Elucidation of pathological mechanism caused by human disease mutation in CaMKIIβ"/>
<p>We elucidated the pathogenic mechanism of the CaMKIIβ P213L mutation identified in a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder by next generation sequencing. The functional role of the P213 site has not been understood, but we found that the mutation at this site caused destabilization and degradation of CaMKIIβ <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in motor dysfunction of mutant mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, we have identified CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders by whole exome sequencing study. Most CaMKII mutants have increased phosphorylation of Thr286/287, which induces autonomous activity of CaMKII, using cell culture experiments. In this study, we explored the pathological mechanism of motor dysfunction observed exclusively in a patient with Pro213Leu mutation in CaMKIIβ using a mouse model of the human disease. The homozygous CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed age-dependent motor dysfunction and growth failure from 2 weeks after birth. In the cerebellum, the mutation did not alter the mRNA transcript level, but the CaMKIIβ protein level was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in contrast to previous result from cell culture, Thr287 phosphorylation of CaMKIIβ was also reduced. CaMKIIβ Pro213Leu knockin mice showed similar motor dysfunction as CaMKIIβ knockout mice, newly providing evidence for a loss of function rather than a gain of function. Our disease model mouse showed similar phenotypes of the patient, except for epileptic seizures. We clearly demonstrated that the pathological mechanism is a reduction of mutant CaMKIIβ in the brain, and the physiological aspects of mutation were greatly different between <i>in vivo</i> and cell culture.</p>

                Humans and animals alike perform behaviors—like putting on a sweater or building a warm nest—to regulate body temperature. In this issue of Neuron, Jung et al. (2022) reveal a parabrachial nucleus-to-lateral hypothalamus circuit that regulates thermoregulatory behavior, a circuit distinct from that which governs motivated feeding behavior.

                The brain requires a lot of energy to carry out its functions at peak performance. In times of energy deficit, something has to give. In this issue of Neuron, Padamsey et al. (2021) explore how metabolic demands impact cortical coding by demonstrating the effects of food restriction on visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive interrogation of the ADAR2 deaminase domain for engineering enhanced RNA editing activity and specificity</a></h4>

              
                Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) can be repurposed to enable programmable RNA editing, however their enzymatic activity on adenosines flanked by a 5' guanosine is very low, thus limiting their utility as a transcriptome engineering toolset. To address this issue, we first performed a novel deep mutational scan of the ADAR2 deaminase domain, directly measuring the impact of every amino acid substitution across 261 residues, on RNA editing. This enabled us to create a domain wide mutagenesis map while also revealing a novel hyperactive variant with improved enzymatic activity at <i>5'-GAN-3'</i> motifs. However, exogenous delivery of ADAR enzymes, especially hyperactive variants, leads to significant transcriptome wide off-targeting. To solve this problem, we engineered a split ADAR2 deaminase which resulted in 1000-fold more specific RNA editing as compared to full-length deaminase overexpression. We anticipate that this systematic engineering of the ADAR2 deaminase domain will enable broader utility of the ADAR toolset for RNA biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Connexins evolved after early chordates lost innexin diversity</a></h4>

              
                Gap junction channels are formed by two unrelated protein families. Non-chordates use the primordial innexins, while chordates use connexins that superseded the gap junction function of innexins. Chordates retained innexin-homologs, but N-glycosylation prevents them from forming gap junctions. It is puzzling why chordates seem to exclusively use the new gap junction protein and why no chordates should exist that use non-glycosylated innexins to form gap junctions. Here, we identified glycosylation sites of 2388 innexins from 174 non-chordate and 276 chordate species. Among all chordates, we found not a single innexin without glycosylation sites. Surprisingly, the glycosylation motif is also widespread among non-chordate innexins indicating that glycosylated innexins are not a novelty of chordates. In addition, we discovered a loss of innexin diversity during early chordate evolution. Most importantly, lancelets, which lack connexins, exclusively possess only one highly conserved innexin with one glycosylation site. A bottleneck effect might thus explain why connexins have become the only protein used to form chordate gap junctions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Both consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators impact mosquito populations and have implications for disease transmission</a></h4>

              
                Predator-prey interactions influence prey traits through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects, and variation in these traits can shape vector-borne disease dynamics. Meta-analysis methods were employed to generate predation effect sizes by different categories of predators and mosquito prey. This analysis showed that multiple families of aquatic predators are effective in consumptively reducing mosquito survival, and that the survival of <i>Aedes</i>, <i>Anopheles</i>, and <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes is negatively impacted by consumptive effects of predators. Mosquito larval size was found to play a more important role in explaining the heterogeneity of consumptive effects from predators than mosquito genus. Mosquito survival and body size were reduced by non-consumptive effects of predators, but development time was not significantly impacted. In addition, <i>Culex</i> vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size, and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition. These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission.

                The pandemic of antibiotic resistance represents a major human health threat demanding new antimicrobial strategies. MprF is the synthase and flippase of the phospholipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol that increases virulence and resistance of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA) and other pathogens to cationic host defense peptides and antibiotics. With the aim to design MprF inhibitors that could sensitize MRSA to antimicrobial agents and support the clearance of staphylococcal infections with minimal selection pressure, we developed MprF-targeting monoclonal antibodies, which bound and blocked the MprF flippase subunit. Antibody M-C7.1 targeted a specific loop in the flippase domain that proved to be exposed at both sides of the bacterial membrane, thereby enhancing the mechanistic understanding of bacterial lipid translocation. M-C7.1 rendered MRSA susceptible to host antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics such as daptomycin, and it impaired MRSA survival in human phagocytes. Thus, MprF inhibitors are recommended for new anti-virulence approaches against MRSA and other bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Developmental single-cell transcriptomics of hypothalamic POMC neurons reveal the genetic trajectories of multiple neuropeptidergic phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are essential to regulate food intake and energy balance. However, the ontogenetic transcriptional programs that specify the identity and functioning of these neurons are poorly understood. Here, we use scRNAseq to define the transcriptomes characterizing <i>Pomc</i>-expressing cells in the developing hypothalamus and TRAP-seq to analyze the subsequent translatomes of mature POMC neurons. Our data showed that <i>Pomc</i>-expressing neurons give rise to multiple developmental pathways expressing different levels of <i>Pomc</i> and unique combinations of transcription factors. The predominant cluster, featured by high levels of <i>Pomc </i>and <i>Prdm12</i> transcripts represents the canonical arcuate POMC neurons. Additional cell clusters expressing medium or low levels of <i>Pomc</i> mature into different neuronal phenotypes featured by distinct sets of transcription factors, neuropeptides, processing enzymes, cell surface and nuclear receptors. We conclude that the genetic programs specifying the identity and differentiation of arcuate POMC neurons are diverse and generate a heterogeneous repertoire of neuronal phenotypes early in development that continue to mature postnatally.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rif2 protects Rap1-depleted telomeres from MRX-mediated degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Rap1 is the main protein that binds double-stranded telomeric DNA in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Examination of the telomere functions of Rap1 is complicated by the fact that it also acts as a transcriptional regulator of hundreds of genes and is encoded by an essential gene. In this study, we disrupt Rap1 telomere association by expressing a mutant telomerase RNA subunit (tlc1-tm) that introduces mutant telomeric repeats. <i>tlc1-tm</i> cells grow similar to wild-type cells, although depletion of Rap1 at telomeres causes defects in telomere length regulation and telomere capping. Rif2 is a protein normally recruited to telomeres by Rap1, but we show that Rif2 can still associate with Rap1-depleted <i>tlc1-tm</i> telomeres, and that this association is required to inhibit telomere degradation by the MRX complex. Rif2 and the Ku complex work in parallel to prevent <i>tlc1-tm </i>telomere degradation; <i>tlc1-tm</i> cells lacking Rif2 and the Ku complex are inviable. The partially redundant mechanisms may explain the rapid evolution of telomere components in budding yeast species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Open-source, Python-based, hardware and software for controlling behavioural neuroscience experiments</a></h4>

              
                Laboratory behavioural tasks are an essential research tool. As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends, we developed pyControl, a system of open-source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system’s design and rationale, present validation experiments characterising system performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and head-fixed mouse behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural organization and dynamics of FCHo2 docking on membranes</a></h4>

              
                Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a central trafficking pathway in eukaryotic cells regulated by phosphoinositides. The plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) plays an instrumental role in driving CME initiation. The F-BAR domain only protein 1 and 2 complex (FCHo1/2) is among the early proteins that reach the plasma membrane, but the exact mechanisms triggering its recruitment remain elusive. Here, we show the molecular dynamics of FCHo2 self-assembly on membranes by combining minimal reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> and cellular systems. Our results indicate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> domains assist FCHo2 docking at specific membrane regions, where it self-assembles into ring-like shape protein patches. We show that the binding of FCHo2 on cellular membranes promotes PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering at the boundary of cargo receptors and that this accumulation enhances clathrin assembly. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic framework that could explain the recruitment of early PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-interacting proteins at endocytic sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Most primary olfactory neurons have individually neutral effects on behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals use olfactory receptors to navigate mates, food, and danger. However, for complex olfactory systems, it is unknown what proportion of primary olfactory sensory neurons can individually drive avoidance or attraction. Similarly, the rules that govern behavioral responses to receptor combinations are unclear. We used optogenetic analysis in <i>Drosophila </i>to map the behavior elicited by olfactory-receptor neuron (ORN) classes: just one-fifth of ORN-types drove either avoidance or attraction. Although wind and hunger are closely linked to olfaction, neither had much effect on single-class responses. Several pooling rules have been invoked to explain how ORN types combine their behavioral influences; we activated two-way combinations and compared patterns of single- and double-ORN responses: these comparisons were inconsistent with simple pooling. We infer that the majority of primary olfactory sensory neurons have neutral behavioral effects individually, but participate in broad, odor-elicited ensembles with potent behavioral effects arising from complex interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential regulation of cranial and cardiac neural crest by serum response factor and its cofactors</a></h4>

              
                Serum response factor (SRF) is an essential transcription factor that influences many cellular processes including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. SRF directly regulates and is required for immediate early gene (IEG) and actin cytoskeleton-related gene expression. SRF coordinates these competing transcription programs through discrete sets of cofactors, the Ternary Complex Factors (TCFs) and Myocardin Related Transcription Factors (MRTFs). The relative contribution of these two programs to <i>in vivo</i> SRF activity and mutant phenotypes is not fully understood. To study how SRF utilizes its cofactors during development, we generated a knock-in <i>Srf<sup>aI</sup></i> allele in mice harboring point mutations that disrupt SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation but leave SRF-TCF activity unaffected. Homozygous <i>Srf<sup>aI/aI</sup></i> mutants die at E10.5 with notable cardiovascular phenotypes, and neural crest conditional mutants succumb at birth to defects of the cardiac outflow tract but display none of the craniofacial phenotypes associated with complete loss of SRF in that lineage. Our studies further support an important role for MRTF mediating SRF function in cardiac neural crest and suggest new mechanisms by which SRF regulates transcription during development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fine-tuning of β-catenin in mouse thymic epithelial cells is required for postnatal T-cell development</a></h4>

              
                In the thymus, the thymic epithelium provides a microenvironment essential for the development of functionally competent and self-tolerant T cells. Previous findings showed that modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mouse thymic epithelial cells (TECs) disrupts embryonic thymus organogenesis. However, the role of β-catenin in TECs for postnatal T-cell development remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) of β-catenin highly specific in mouse TECs. We found that GOF of β-catenin in TECs results in severe thymic dysplasia and T-cell deficiency beginning from the embryonic period. By contrast, LOF of β-catenin in TECs reduces the number of cortical TECs and thymocytes modestly and only postnatally. These results indicate that fine-tuning of β-catenin expression within a permissive range is required for TECs to generate an optimal microenvironment to support postnatal T-cell development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pain-related learning signals in the human insula</a></h4>

              
                Pain is not only a perceptual phenomenon, but also a preeminent learning signal. In reinforcement learning models, prediction errors (PEs) play a crucial role, i.e. the mismatch between expectation and sensory input. In particular, advanced learning models require the representation of different types of PEs, namely signed PEs (whether more or less pain was expected) to specify the direction of learning, and unsigned PEs (the absolute deviation from an expectation) to adapt the learning rate. The insula has been shown to play an important role in pain intensity coding and in signaling surprise. However, mainly unsigned PEs could be identified in the anterior insula. It remains an open question whether these PEs are specific to pain, and whether signed PEs are also represented in the insula. To answer these questions, 47 subjects learned associations of two conditioned stimuli (CS) with four unconditioned stimuli (US; painful heat or loud sound, of one low and one high intensity each) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) measurements. CS-US associations reversed multiple times between intensities and between sensory modalities, generating frequent PEs. SCRs indicated comparable nonspecific characteristics of the two modalities. fMRI analyses focusing on the insular and opercular cortices contralateral to painful stimulation showed  that activation in the anterior insula correlated with unsigned intensity PEs. Importantly, this unsigned PE signal was similar for pain and aversive sounds and also modality PEs, indicating an unspecific aversive surprise signal.  Conversely, signed pain intensity PE signals were modality-specific and located in the dorsal posterior insula, an area previously implicated in pain intensity processing. Previous studies have identified abnormal insula function and abnormal learning as potential causes of pain chronification. Our findings link these results and suggest one potential mechanism, namely a misrepresentation of learning relevant prediction errors in the insular cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dogma and belief: the primary lesion in age-related hearing loss is old news</a></h4>

              
                Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is the most common sensory deficit globally, and the biggest modifiable risk factor for a later dementia diagnosis. Despite its ubiquity, however, the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis is reportedly contentious, particularly the relative role of damage to the sensory outer hair cells compared to the stria vascularis, an important inner ear structure that maintains the ionic concentration of inner ear fluids that surround it. To determine what might be the dogma of the field regarding the primary pathology in presbycusis, we conducted an online Google survey (https://forms.gle/GPreoePmRxBBkchc7) asking relevant respondents in the field their opinions on the matter. In Question (Q1), respondents were asked to rate (in your opinion) from (least likely) to (most likely) (on a scale 1 to 4 [being most likely]) what is the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis? in terms of damage to: i) the inner hair cells, ii) outer hair cells (OHCs), iii) spiral ganglion, iv) stria vascularis. The term dogma suggests that the proportion of people in the field who believe that the main cause of presbycusis is damage to the stria vascularis is at least 50%. The results of our survey estimated this proportion to be 19/101 = 0.188 (95% CI [0.124 0.275]) and a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that this proportion is at least 0.5 was rejected (p < 10-10). When it came to opining what other professionals in the field consider to be the primary pathology contributing to presbycusis (Q2), the tendency to rank damage to OHCs as being the primary pathology was 45%. Stria vascularis was least likely to be ranked 4 (11%) by professionals in the field opining about the beliefs of others. Even when noise damage was excluded as a factor (Q3), the most likely contributing factor to presbycusis was stated to be damage to the OHCs (42%). Our data suggest the dogma of the field is that damage to outer hair cells is the primary pathology in presbycusis.

                Human myelin disorders are commonly studied in mouse models. Since both clades evolutionarily diverged approximately 85 million years ago, it is critical to know to what extent the myelin protein composition has remained similar. Here we use quantitative proteomics to analyze myelin purified from human white matter and find that the relative abundance of the structural myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP and SEPTIN8 correlates well with that in C57Bl/6N-mice. Conversely, multiple other proteins were identified exclusively or predominantly in human or mouse myelin. This is exemplified by peripheral myelin protein-2 (PMP2), which was specific to human CNS myelin, while tetraspanin-2 (TSPAN2) and connexin-29 (CX29/GJC3) were confined to mouse myelin. Assessing published scRNA-seq-datasets, human and mouse oligodendrocytes display well-correlating transcriptome profiles but divergent expression of distinct genes including Pmp2, Tspan2 and Gjc3. Species-dependent diversity of oligodendroglial mRNA-expression and myelin protein composition can be informative when translating from mouse models to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-specific protein network mapping of autism risk genes identifies shared biological mechanisms and disease relevant pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Sequencing studies have identified hundreds of risk genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the signaling networks of genes at the protein level remain largely unexplored, which can provide insight into previously unknown individual and convergent disease pathways in the brain. To address this gap, we used neuron-specific proximity-labeling proteomics (BioID) to identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of 41 ASD-risk genes. Network analysis revealed the combined 41 risk gene PPI network map had more shared connectivity between unrelated ASD-risk genes than represented in existing public databases. We identified common pathways between established and uncharacterized risk genes, including synaptic transmission, mitochondrial/metabolic processes, Wnt signaling pathways, ion channel activity and MAPK signaling. Investigation of the mitochondrial and metabolic network using gene knockouts revealed a functional hub in neurons for multiple risk genes not previously associated with this pathway. Further, we identified that the uncharacterized ASD-risk gene PPP2R5D localizes to the synapse, which is disrupted by patient de novo missense mutations. Investigation of de novo missense variants of additional synaptic ASD-risk genes demonstrated that changes in PPI networks can capture synaptic transmission deficits. The neuronal 41 ASD-risk gene PPI network map also revealed enrichment for an additional 112 ASD-risk genes and human brain cell types implicated in ASD pathology. Interestingly, clustering of ASD-risk genes based on their PPI network connectivity identified multiple gene groups that correlate mutation-type to clinical behavior scores. Together, our data reveal that using PPI networks to map ASD risk genes can identify previously unknown individual and convergent neuronal signaling networks, provide a method to assess the impact of patient variants, and reveal new biological insight into disease mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rethinking Statistical Learning as a Dynamic Stochastic Process, from The Motor Systems Perspective</a></h4>

              
                The brain integrates streams of sensory input and builds accurate predictions, while arriving at stable percepts under disparate time scales. This stochastic process bears different dynamics for different people, yet statistical learning (SL) currently averages out, as noise, individual fluctuations in data streams registered from the brain as the person learns. We here adopt the motor systems perspective to reframe SL. Specifically, we rethink this problem using the demands that the person's brain faces to predict, and control variations in biorhythmic activity akin to those present in bodily motions. This new approach harnesses gross data as the important signals, to reassess how individuals learn predictive information in stable and unstable environments. We find two types of learners: narrow-variance learners, who retain explicit knowledge of the regularity embedded in the stimuli -the goal. They seem to use an error-correction strategy steadily present in both stable and unstable cases. In contrast, broad-variance learners emerge only in the unstable environment. They undergo an initial period of memoryless learning characterized by a gamma process that starts out exponentially distributed but converges to Gaussian. We coin this mode exploratory, preceding the more general error-correction mode characterized by skewed-to-symmetric distributions and higher signal content from the start. Our work demonstrates that statistical learning is a highly dynamic and stochastic process, unfolding at different time scales, and evolving distinct learning strategies on demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Algorithms for Estimating Time-Locked Neural Response Components in Cortical Processing of Continuous Speech</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The Temporal Response Function (TRF) is a linear model of neural activity time-locked to continuous stimuli, including continuous speech. TRFs based on speech envelopes typically have distinct components that have provided remarkable insights into the cortical processing of speech. However, current methods may lead to less than reliable estimates of single-subject TRF components. Here, we compare two established methods, in TRF component estimation, and also propose novel estimation algorithms that utilize prior knowledge of these components, bypassing the full TRF estimation. Methods: We compared two established algorithms, ridge and boosting, and two novel algorithms based on Subspace Pursuit and Expectation Maximization, which directly estimate TRF components given plausible assumptions regarding component characteristics. Single-channel, multi-channel, and source-localized TRFs were fit on simulations and real magnetoencephalographic data. Performance metrics included model fit and component estimation accuracy. Results: Boosting and ridge have comparable performance in component estimation. The novel algorithms outperformed the others in simulations, but not on real data, possibly due to the plausible assumptions not actually being met. Ridge had marginally better model fits on real data, but also more spurious TRF activity. Conclusion: Results indicate that both smooth (ridge) and sparse (boosting) algorithms perform comparably at TRF component estimation. The SP and EM algorithms may be accurate, but rely on assumptions of component characteristics. Significance: This systematic comparison establishes the suitability of widely used and novel algorithms for estimating robust TRF components, which is essential for improved subject-specific investigations into the cortical processing of speech.

	<p>Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) is a highly effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but CPAP adherence remains suboptimal. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered sleep medicine services and aspects of daily living for sleep medicine patients, which may further compromise CPAP adherence. Sleep medicine patients were distributed an online survey at baseline and six months later (January&amp;amp;ndash;May 2021). Participants answered questions regarding CPAP use (any changes in CPAP use, sleep quality with CPAP use, CPAP use as advised, and changes in daily habits). Eighty-one adults completed the baseline survey, and 54 adults completed the follow-up survey. Twenty-seven participants reported a diagnosis of OSA and were prescribed CPAP (mean age 58 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.2 years, 48% female, 67% Caucasian). Longitudinal analysis with chi-square association testing showed significant changes in CPAP use as advised and significant improvements in sleep quality with CPAP use when comparing the baseline to six-month follow-up survey. Additionally, logistic regression was performed to determine if pre-pandemic sleep study results (apnea-hypopnea index and respiratory disturbance index) predicted self-reported CPAP use during the pandemic, though no association was found. Throughout the pandemic, sleep medicine patients improved their CPAP use as advised and reported significant improvements in sleep quality with CPAP use.</p>

	<p>Background: Aberrant motor behaviour or wandering refers to aimless movement without a specific purpose. Wandering is common in patients with dementia and leads to early institutionalization and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden. Non-pharmacological interventions should be also considered as a first-line solution for the wandering because current pharmacological treatment has serious side-effects. Methods: A cross-over randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 60 participants of all stages and different types of dementia was conducted in Greece. The sample was randomly assigned in 6 different groups of 10 participants each. Every intervention lasted for 5 days, and there were 2 days as a wash-out period. There was no drop-out rate. The measurements used were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Rating Scale for Symptoms in Dementia (FRSSD), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The interventions that were evaluated were reminiscence therapy (RT), music therapy (MT), and physical exercise (PE). Results: NPI scores were reduced in the group receiving PE (p = 0.006). When MT (p = 0.018) follows PE, wandering symptoms are reduced further. RT should follow MT in order to reduce wandering more (p = 0.034). The same combination was effective for the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden as well; PE (p = 0.004), MT (p = 0.036), RT (p = 0.039). Conclusions: An effective combination that can reduce wandering symptoms in all stages and types of dementia was found: The best order was PH-MT-RT. The same combination in the same order reduced caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden.</p>
