     alt="Secretagogin in the brain and pituitary of the catfish, Clarias batrachus: Molecular characterization and regulation by insulin"/>
<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the prefrontal cortex can improve signs of consciousness in patients in a minimally conscious state. Transcranial pulsed-current stimulation (tPCS) over the mastoids can modulate brain activity and connectivity in healthy controls. This study investigated the feasibility of tPCS as a therapeutic tool in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) and compared its neurophysiological and behavioral effects with prefrontal tDCS. This pilot study was a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial with three sessions: bi-mastoid tPCS, prefrontal tDCS, and sham. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral assessments were collected before and after each stimulation session. Post minus pre differences were compared using Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Twelve patients with DoC were included in the study (eight females, four traumatic brain injury, 50.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 y.o., 8.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.5 months post-injury). We did not observe any side-effects following tPCS, nor tDCS, and confirmed their feasibility and safety. We did not find a significant effect of the stimulation on EEG nor behavioral outcomes for tPCS. However, consistent with prior findings, our exploratory analyses suggest that tDCS induces behavioral improvements and an increase in theta frontal functional connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Agmatine Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity by Activating PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity can be partially attributed to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and agmatine is well-known for the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway to inhibit ROS production. Whether agmatine could be used to alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is investigated. Cisplatin-exposed House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear explants showed increased ROS production detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and decreased cell viability detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) or Myosin 7a staining, which could be reversed by the agmatine pretreatment. Cisplatin intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated damaged auditory function as indicated by distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) assays, and trans-tympanically administrated agmatine in the left ears could partly prevent the auditory function loss. Mechanistically, downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, upregulated Bcl2-associated x (Bax) expression, and diminished p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were detected in cisplatin-exposed HEI-OC1 cells and cochlear explants, which could be prevented by the pretreatment with agmatine. Our investigation demonstrates that agmatine pretreatment could alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity with the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Calcium Channel Nanodomains Drive Presynaptic Calcium Entry at Lamprey Reticulospinal Presynaptic Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efficient and reliable neurotransmission requires precise coupling between action potentials (APs), Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and neurotransmitter release. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirements for release, including the number of channels required, their subtypes, and their location with respect to primed vesicles, remains to be precisely defined for central synapses. Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may occur through small numbers or even single open Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but these questions remain largely unexplored in simple active zone (AZ) synapses common in the nervous system, and key to addressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and synaptic dysfunction underlying numerous neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present single channel analysis of evoked AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, using cell-attached patch clamp and lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), resolving small channel numbers evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following depolarization, at single AZs in individual central lamprey reticulospinal presynaptic terminals from male and females. We show a small pool (mean of 23) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at each terminal, comprising N-(CaV2.2), P/Q-(CaV2.1), and R-(CaV2.3) subtypes, available to gate neurotransmitter release. Significantly, of this pool only one to seven channels (mean of 4) open on depolarization. High temporal fidelity lattice light-sheet imaging reveals AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients exhibiting quantal amplitude variations of 0&ndash;6 event sizes between individual APs and stochastic variation of precise locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry within the AZ. Further, total Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel numbers at each AZ correlate to the number of presynaptic primed synaptic vesicles. Dispersion of channel openings across the AZ and the similar number of primed vesicles and channels indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via as few as one channel may trigger neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) causes neurotransmitter release. To understand neurotransmission, its modulation, and plasticity, we must quantify Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and its relationship to vesicle fusion. This requires direct recordings from active zones (AZs), previously possible only at calyceal terminals containing many AZs, where few channels open following action potentials (APs; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B56">Sheng et al., 2012</cross-ref>), and even single channel openings may trigger release (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B58">Stanley, 1991</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">1993</cross-ref>). However, recording from more conventional terminals with single AZs commonly found centrally has thus far been impossible. We addressed this by cell-attached recordings from acutely dissociated single lamprey giant axon AZs, and by lattice light sheet microscopy of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We demonstrate nanodomains of presynaptic VGCCs coupling with primed vesicles with 1:1 stoichiometry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mu Opioid Receptors Acutely Regulate Adenosine Signaling in Striatal Glutamate Afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endogenous adenosine plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis, and adenosine levels are tightly regulated across neural circuits. In the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release, but the source and mechanism underlying its accumulation are largely unknown. Opioids also inhibit neurotransmitter release in the DMS and influence adenosine accumulation after prolonged exposure. However, how these two neurotransmitter systems interact acutely is also largely unknown. This study demonstrates that activation of &micro; opioid receptors, but not  opioid receptors or  opioid receptors, inhibits tonic activation of adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs via a cAMP-dependent mechanism in both male and female mice. Further, selectively knocking out &micro; opioid receptors from thalamic presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that activation of &micro; opioid receptors on D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs, but not D<SUB>2</SUB>R-positive MSNs, is necessary to inhibit tonic adenosine signaling on presynaptic terminals. Given the role of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs in movement and motivated behaviors, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which these neurons regulate their own synaptic inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding interactions between neuromodulatory systems within brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The present work uncovers a novel role of opioids in acutely inhibiting adenosine accumulation and subsequent adenosine receptor signaling in the striatum by inhibiting the production of cAMP. Adenosine receptor signaling regulates striatal neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine. Furthermore, interactions between adenosine<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors and numerous other GPCRs, including D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine and CB<SUB>1</SUB> cannabinoid receptors, suggest that endogenous adenosine broadly modulates striatal GPCR signaling. Additionally, this work discovered that the source of resting endogenous extracellular adenosine is likely D<SUB>1</SUB>, but not D<SUB>2</SUB> receptor-positive medium spiny neurons, suggesting that opioid signaling and manipulation of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-expressing medium spiny neuron cAMP activity can broadly affect striatal function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repetitive Mild Closed Head Injury in Adolescent Mice Is Associated with Impaired Proteostasis, Neuroinflammation, and Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children and adolescents leads to acute and chronic neurologic sequelae and is linked to later life neurodegenerative disease. However, the biological mechanisms connecting early life mTBI to neurodegeneration remain unknown. Using an adolescent mouse repetitive closed head injury model that induces progressive cognitive impairment in males and anxiety in females in the absence of overt histopathology, we examined transcriptional and translational changes in neurons isolated from sham and injured brain in the chronic phase after injury. At 14 months, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of cortical brain tissue identified disruption of genes associated with neuronal proteostasis and evidence for disrupted ligand-receptor signaling networks in injured mice. Western blot analysis of isolated neurons showed evidence of inflammasome activation and downstream IL-1&beta; processing, as previously demonstrated in acute CNS injury models, and accumulation of misfolded, hyperphosphorylated tau, and changes in expression of proteins suggestive of impaired translation in males but not in females. At 6 months, injured IL-1 receptor 1 (<I>IL-1R1</I>) KO mice, which are protected from postinjury cognitive deficits, had decreased accumulation of pro-IL-1&beta; and misfolded tau in cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that IL-1R1 is upstream of inflammasome priming (defined as increase in pro-IL-1&beta;) and abnormal tau phosphorylation. Together, our findings provide evidence for neuronal inflammasome activation and impaired proteostasis as key mechanisms linking repetitive mTBI in adolescence to later life neurologic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Repetitive mild closed head injury in adolescent male mice leads to impaired proteostasis, tau phosphorylation, and inflammasome activation in neurons later in adulthood through mechanisms involving IL-1 receptor 1. The data are the first to link repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in adolescence to neurodegeneration and suggest molecular targets and pathways to prevent neurologic sequelae in the chronic period after injuries.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">ADAM17 Regulates p75NTR-Mediated Fibrinolysis and Nerve Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously reported that a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 is a key protease regulating myelin formation. We now describe a role for ADAM17 during the Wallerian degeneration (WD) process. Unexpectedly, we observed that glial ADAM17, by regulating p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing, cell autonomously promotes remyelination, while neuronal ADAM17 is dispensable. Accordingly, p75<sup>NTR</sup> abnormally accumulates specifically when ADAM17 is maximally expressed leading to a downregulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) expression, excessive fibrin accumulation over time, and delayed remyelination. Mutant mice also present impaired macrophage recruitment and defective nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Thus, ADAM17 expressed in Schwann cells, controls the whole WD process, and its absence hampers effective nerve repair. Collectively, we describe a previously uncharacterized role for glial ADAM17 during nerve regeneration. Based on the results of our study, we posit that, unlike development, glial ADAM17 promotes remyelination through the regulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated fibrinolysis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The &alpha;-secretase a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17, although relevant for developmental PNS myelination, has never been investigated in Wallerian degeneration (WD). We now unravel a new mechanism of action for this protease and show that ADAM17 cleaves p75<sup>NTR</sup>, regulates fibrin clearance, and eventually fine-tunes remyelination. The results presented in this study provide important insights into the complex regulation of remyelination following nerve injury, identifying in ADAM17 and p75<sup>NTR</sup> a new signaling axis implicated in these events. Modulation of this pathway could have important implications in promoting nerve remyelination, an often-inefficient process, with the aim of restoring a functional axo-glial unit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">SIPA1L1/SPAR1 Interacts with the Neurabin Family of Proteins and is Involved in GPCR Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1; also known as SPAR1) has been proposed to regulate synaptic functions that are important in maintaining normal neuronal activities, such as regulating spine growth and synaptic scaling, as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. However, its physiological role remains poorly understood. Here, we performed expression analyses using super-resolution microscopy (SRM) in mouse brain and demonstrated that SIPA1L1 is mainly localized to general submembranous regions in neurons, but surprisingly, not to PSD. Our screening for physiological interactors of SIPA1L1 in mouse brain identified spinophilin and neurabin-1, regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but rejected PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex components. Furthermore, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal spine size distribution and NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed aberrant responses to &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic receptor (a spinophilin target) or adenosine A1 receptor (a neurabin-1 target) agonist stimulation, and striking behavioral anomalies, such as hyperactivity, enhanced anxiety, learning impairments, social interaction deficits, and enhanced epileptic seizure susceptibility. Male mice were used for all experiments. Our findings revealed unexpected properties of SIPA1L1, suggesting a possible association of SIPA1L1 deficiency with neuropsychiatric disorders related to dysregulated GPCR signaling, such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or fragile X syndrome (FXS).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1) is thought to regulate essential synaptic functions as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. In our screening for physiological SIPA1L1-interactors, we identified G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-signaling regulators. Moreover, SIPA1L1 knock-out (KO) mice showed striking behavioral anomalies, which may be relevant to GPCR signaling. Our findings revealed an unexpected role of SIPA1L1, which may open new avenues for research on neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dysregulated GPCR signaling. Another important aspect of this paper is that we showed effective methods for checking PSD association and identifying native protein interactors that are difficult to solubilize. These results may serve as a caution for future claims about interacting proteins and PSD proteins, which could eventually save time and resources for researchers and avoid confusion in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motoneuron-Specific PTEN Deletion in Mice Induces Neuronal Hypertrophy and Also Regeneration after Facial Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>In postmitotic neurons, several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including p53, Rb, and PTEN, modulate the axon regeneration success after injury. Particularly, PTEN inhibition is a key driver of successful CNS axon regeneration after optic nerve or spinal cord injury. In contrast, in peripheral neurons, TSG influence in neuronal morphology, physiology, and pathology has not been investigated to the same depth. In this study, we conditionally deleted PTEN from mouse facial motoneurons (<I>Chat-Cre/Pten<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></I>) and analyzed neuronal responses <I>in vivo</I> with or without peripheral facial nerve injury in male and female mice. In uninjured motoneurons, PTEN loss induced somatic, axonal, and nerve hypertrophy, synaptic terminal enlargement and reduction in physiological whisker movement. Despite these morphologic and physiological changes, PTEN deletion positively regulated facial nerve regeneration and recovery of whisker movement after nerve injury. Regenerating PTEN-deficient motoneurons upregulated P-CREB and a signaling pathway involving P-Akt, P-PRAS40, P-mTOR, and P-4EBP1. In aged mice (12 months), PTEN deletion induced hair loss and facial hyperplasia of the epidermis. This suggests a time window in younger mice with PTEN loss stimulating axon growth after injury, however, at the risk of hyperplasia formation at later time points in the old animal. Overall, our data highlight a dual TSG function with PTEN loss impairing physiological neuron function but furthermore underscoring the positive effects of PTEN ablation in axon regeneration also for the PNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) restrict cell proliferation and growth. TSG inhibition, including p53 and PTEN, stimulates axon regeneration after CNS injury. In contrast, in PNS axon regeneration, TSGs have not been analyzed in great depth. Herein we show enhanced peripheral axon regeneration after PTEN deletion from facial motoneurons. This invokes a signaling cascade with novel PTEN partners, including CREB and PRAS40. In adult mice, PTEN loss induces hyperplasia of the skin epidermis, suggesting detrimental consequences when reaching adulthood in contrast to a beneficial TSG role for regeneration in young adult mice. Thus, our data highlight the double-edged sword nature of interfering with TSG function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Time Course of Activity-Dependent Changes in Auditory Nerve Synapses Reveals Multiple Underlying Cellular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal levels of acoustic activity can result in hearing problems such as tinnitus and language processing disorders, but the underlying cellular and synaptic changes triggered by abnormal activity are not well understood. To address this issue, we studied the time course of activity-dependent changes that occur at auditory nerve synapses in mice of both sexes after noise exposure and conductive hearing loss. We found that EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression decreased within 2 d of noise exposure through a decrease in the probability of vesicle release (<I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>). This was followed by a gradual increase in EPSC amplitude through a larger pool of releasable vesicles (<I>N</I>). Occlusion of the ear canal led to a rapid decrease in EPSC amplitude through a decrease in <I>N</I>, which was followed by an increase in EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression through an increase in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>. After returning to normal sound levels, synaptic depression recovered to control levels within 1&ndash;2 d. However, repeated exposure to noise for as little as 8 h/d caused synaptic changes after 7 d, suggesting recovery did not fully offset changes. Thus, there appear to be three activity-dependent mechanisms in auditory nerve synapses&mdash;bidirectional changes in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB> in 1&ndash;2 d, slower bidirectional changes in <I>N</I> through synaptic growth or retraction, and rapid downregulation of <I>N</I> with low activity. The dynamic changes indicate that multiple mechanisms are present to fine-tune synaptic fidelity across different acoustic conditions in a simple relay.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hearing impairments can arise from exposure to noise or conductive hearing loss. This appears to result from changes in the brain, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We study this issue by studying the synapses made by auditory nerve fibers called endbulbs of Held. These synapses undergo bidirectional changes in size and release probability of neurotransmitter in response to increased or decreased activity. Here, we made a close examination of how quickly these synaptic characteristics change, which indicates there are at least three cellular mechanisms underlying changes. Furthermore, repeated exposure to brief periods of noise can produce cumulative effects. These changes could significantly affect hearing, especially because they occur at the start of the central auditory pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human NREM Sleep Promotes Brain-Wide Vasomotor and Respiratory Pulsations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The physiological underpinnings of the necessity of sleep remain uncertain. Recent evidence suggests that sleep increases the convection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and promotes the export of interstitial solutes, thus providing a framework to explain why all vertebrate species require sleep. Cardiovascular, respiratory and vasomotor brain pulsations have each been shown to drive CSF flow along perivascular spaces, yet it is unknown how such pulsations may change during sleep in humans. To investigate these pulsation phenomena in relation to sleep, we simultaneously recorded fast fMRI, magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a group of healthy volunteers. We quantified sleep-related changes in the signal frequency distributions by spectral entropy analysis and calculated the strength of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) brain pulsations by power sum analysis in 15 subjects (age 26.5 &plusmn; 4.2 years, 6 females). Finally, we identified spatial similarities between EEG slow oscillation (0.2&ndash;2 Hz) power and MREG pulsations. Compared with wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was characterized by reduced spectral entropy and increased brain pulsation intensity. These effects were most pronounced in posterior brain areas for very low-frequency (&le;0.1 Hz) vasomotor pulsations but were also evident brain-wide for respiratory pulsations, and to a lesser extent for cardiac brain pulsations. There was increased EEG slow oscillation power in brain regions spatially overlapping with those showing sleep-related MREG pulsation changes. We suggest that reduced spectral entropy and enhanced pulsation intensity are characteristic of NREM sleep. With our findings of increased power of slow oscillation, the present results support the proposition that sleep promotes fluid transport in human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that the spectral power of physiological brain pulsation mechanisms driven by vasomotor, respiration, and cardiac rhythms in human brain increase during sleep, extending previous observations of their association with glymphatic brain clearance during sleep in rodents. The magnitudes of increased pulsations follow the rank order of vasomotor greater than respiratory greater than cardiac pulsations, with correspondingly declining spatial extents. Spectral entropy, previously known as vigilance and as an anesthesia metric, decreased during NREM sleep compared with the awake state in very low and respiratory frequencies, indicating reduced signal complexity. An EEG slow oscillation power increase occurring in the early sleep phase (NREM 1&ndash;2) spatially overlapped with pulsation changes, indicating reciprocal mechanisms between those measures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Spatiotemporal Link of Temporal Expectations: Contextual Temporal Expectation Is Independent of Spatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal expectation is the ability to construct predictions regarding the timing of events, based on previously experienced temporal regularities of different types. For example, cue-based expectations are constructed when a cue validly indicates when a target is expected to occur. However, in the absence of such cues, expectations can be constructed based on contextual temporal information, including the onset distribution of the event and recent prior experiences, both providing implicit probabilistic information regarding the timing of the event. It was previously suggested that cue-based temporal expectation is exerted via synchronization of spatially specific neural activity at a predictable time of a target, within receptive fields corresponding to the expected location of the target. Here, we tested whether the same theoretical model holds for contextual temporal effects. Participants (<I>n</I> = 40, 25 females) performed a speeded spatial-cuing detection task with two-thirds valid spatial cues. The hazard-rate function of the target was modulated by varying the foreperiod&mdash;the interval between the spatial cue and the target&mdash;among trials and was manipulated between groups by changing the interval distribution. Reaction times were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, accounting for hazard and sequential effects. Results showed that the effects of contextual temporal structures on reaction times were independent of spatial attention. This suggests that the spatiotemporal mechanisms, thought to account for cue-based expectation, cannot explain other sources of temporal expectations. We conclude that expectations based on contextual structures have different characteristics than cue-based temporal expectation, suggesting reliance on distinct neural mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal expectation is the ability to predict an event onset based on temporal regularities. A neurophysiological model suggested that temporal expectation relies on the synchronization of spatially specific neurons whose receptive fields represent the attended location. This model predicts that temporal expectation would be evident solely within the locus of spatial attention. Existing evidence supported this model for expectation based on associations between a temporal cue and a target, but here we show that it cannot account for temporal expectation that is based on contextual information, that is, the distribution of intervals and recent priors. These findings reveal the existence of different predictive mechanisms for cued and contextual temporal predictions, with the former depending on spatial attention and the latter nonspatially specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adaptive Learning through Temporal Dynamics of State Representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>People adjust their learning rate rationally according to local environmental statistics and calibrate such adjustments based on the broader statistical context. To date, no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural correlates. Here, we attempt to do so using a neural network model that learns to map an internal context representation onto a behavioral response via supervised learning. The network shifts its internal context on receiving supervised signals that are mismatched to its output, thereby changing the "state" to which feedback is associated. A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained. Sustained state transitions that occur after changepoints facilitate faster learning and mimic network reset phenomena observed in the brain during rapid learning. In contrast, state transitions after one-off outlier events are short lived, thereby limiting the impact of outlying observations on future behavior. State transitions in our model provide the first mechanistic interpretation for bidirectional learning signals, such as the P300, that relate to learning differentially according to the source of surprising events and may also shed light on discrepant observations regarding the relationship between transient pupil dilations and learning. Together, our results demonstrate that dynamic latent state representations can afford normative inference and provide a coherent framework for understanding neural signatures of adaptive learning across different statistical environments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How humans adjust their sensitivity to new information in a changing world has remained largely an open question. Bridging insights from normative accounts of adaptive learning and theories of latent state representation, here we propose a feedforward neural network model that adjusts its learning rate online by controlling the speed of transitioning its internal state representations. Our model proposes a mechanistic framework for explaining learning under different statistical contexts, explains previously observed behavior and brain signals, and makes testable predictions for future experimental studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurons in the Monkey's Subthalamic Nucleus Differentially Encode Motivation and Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>The understanding of the electrophysiological properties of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons is crucial since it represents the main target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The study of its nonmotor properties could shed light on the cognitive and motivational alterations possibly encountered after stimulation. In this study, we recorded the activity of STN neurons in two male behaving monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) while they performed a visuomotor motivational task in which visual cues indicated which amount of force was required to obtain which amount of reward. Our results evidenced force- and reward-modulated neurons. After the occurrence of the visual stimuli, the force-modulated neurons mainly fired when a high effort was required. Differently, the activity of the population of reward-modulated neurons encoded the motivational value of the stimuli. This population consisted of neurons increasing or decreasing their activity according to the motivational ranking of the task conditions. Both populations could play complementary roles, one in the implementation of the difficulty of the action and the other in enhancing or slowing its execution based on the subjective value of each condition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An increasing number of studies confers a role to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in motivational and reward-related processes. However, the electrophysiological bases of such properties at the neuronal level remain unclear. The present study investigated the modulation of STN neuronal activity in monkeys performing a motivational task in which the force to produce and the reward obtained were manipulated. We found two main populations of neurons, one modulated by the effort required and the other integrating the motivational subjective value of the stimuli. This last population could help at improving decision-making to act or not, depending on the subjective value set by the motivational context. This highlights the pivotal role of STN in the valuation of cost/benefit for decision-making processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Behavioral Manipulation via Orally Delivered Chemogenetic Actuator in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>The chemogenetic technology referred to as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) offers reversible means to control neuronal activity for investigating its functional correlation with behavioral action. Deschloroclozapine (DCZ), a recently developed highly potent and selective DREADD actuator, displays a capacity to expand the utility of DREADDs for chronic manipulation without side effects in nonhuman primates, which has not yet been validated. Here we investigated the pharmacokinetics and behavioral effects of orally administered DCZ in female and male macaque monkeys. Pharmacokinetic analysis and PET occupancy examination demonstrated that oral administration of DCZ yielded slower and prolonged kinetics, and that its bioavailability was 10%-20% of that in the case of systemic injection. Oral DCZ (300-1000 &mu;g/kg) induced significant working memory impairments for at least 4 h in monkeys with hM4Di expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46). Repeated daily oral doses of DCZ consistently caused similar impairments over two weeks without discernible desensitization. Our results indicate that orally delivered DCZ affords a less invasive strategy for chronic but reversible chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates, and this has potential for clinical application.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The use of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) for chronic manipulation of neuronal activity for days to weeks may be feasible for investigating brain functions and behavior on a long time-scale, and thereby for developing therapeutics for brain disorders, such as epilepsy. Here we performed pharmacokinetics and <I>in vivo</I> occupancy study of orally administered deschloroclozapine to determine a dose range suitable for DREADDs studies. In monkeys expressing hM4Di in the prefrontal cortex, single and repeated daily doses significantly induced working-memory impairments for hours and over two weeks, respectively, without discernible desensitization. These results indicate that orally delivered deschloroclozapine produces long-term stable chemogenetic effects, and holds great promise for the translational use of DREADDs technology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Subjective Visibility from Those of Decision Confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>A key goal of consciousness science is identifying neural signatures of being aware versus unaware of simple stimuli. This is often investigated in the context of near-threshold detection, with reports of stimulus awareness being linked to heightened activation in a frontoparietal network. However, because of reports of stimulus presence typically being associated with higher confidence than reports of stimulus absence, these results could be explained by frontoparietal regions encoding stimulus visibility, decision confidence, or both. In an exploratory analysis, we leverage fMRI data from 35 human participants (20 females) to disentangle these possibilities. We first show that, whereas stimulus identity was best decoded from the visual cortex, stimulus visibility (presence vs absence) was best decoded from prefrontal regions. To control for effects of confidence, we then selectively sampled trials before decoding to equalize confidence distributions between absence and presence responses. This analysis revealed striking differences in the neural correlates of subjective visibility in PFC ROIs, depending on whether or not differences in confidence were controlled for. We interpret our findings as highlighting the importance of controlling for metacognitive aspects of the decision process in the search for neural correlates of visual awareness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While much has been learned over the past two decades about the neural basis of visual awareness, the role of the PFC remains a topic of debate. By applying decoding analyses to functional brain imaging data, we show that prefrontal representations of subjective visibility are contaminated by neural correlates of decision confidence. We propose a new analysis method to control for these metacognitive aspects of awareness reports, and use it to reveal confidence-independent correlates of perceptual judgments in a subset of prefrontal areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral and Neural Dissociation of Social Anxiety and Loneliness</a></h4>

              
                <p>Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loneliness can cause serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anastasis Drives Senescence and Non-Cell Autonomous Neurodegeneration in the Astrogliopathy Alexander Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anastasis is a recently described process in which cells recover after late-stage apoptosis activation. The functional consequences of anastasis for cells and tissues are not clearly understood. Using <I>Drosophila</I>, rat and human cells and tissues, including analyses of both males and females, we present evidence that glia undergoing anastasis in the primary astrogliopathy Alexander disease subsequently express hallmarks of senescence. These senescent glia promote non-cell autonomous death of neurons by secreting interleukin family cytokines. Our findings demonstrate that anastasis can be dysfunctional in neurologic disease by inducing a toxic senescent population of astroglia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Under some conditions cells otherwise destined to die can be rescued just before death in a process called anastasis, or "rising from the dead." The fate and function of cells undergoing a near death experience is not well understood. Here, we find that in models and patient cells from Alexander disease, an important brain disorder in which glial cells promote neuronal dysfunction and death, anastasis of astrocytic glia leads to secretion of toxic signaling molecules and neurodegeneration. These studies demonstrate a previously unexpected deleterious consequence of rescuing cells on the brink of death and suggest therapeutic strategies for Alexander disease and related disorders of glia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Farnesyltransferase Inhibitor Restores Cognitive Deficits in Tsc2+/- Mice through Inhibition of Rheb1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in <I>Tsc1</I> or <I>Tsc2</I>, whose gene products inhibit the small G-protein Rheb1. Rheb1 activates mTORC1, which may cause refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. The mTORC1 inhibitors have been used for TSC patients with intractable epilepsy. However, its effectiveness for cognitive symptoms remains unclear. We found a new signaling pathway for synapse formation through Rheb1 activation, but not mTORC1. Here, we show that treatment with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib increased unfarnesylated (inactive) Rheb1 levels and restored synaptic abnormalities in cultured <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> neurons, whereas rapamycin did not enhance spine synapse formation. Lonafarnib treatment also restored the plasticity-related Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) expression in cultured <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Lonafarnib action was partly dependent on the Rheb1 reduction with syntenin. Oral administration of lonafarnib increased unfarnesylated protein levels without affecting mTORC1 and MAP (mitogen-activated protein (MAP)) kinase signaling, and restored dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampi of male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. In addition, lonafarnib treatment ameliorated contextual memory impairments and restored memory-related Arc expression in male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice <I>in vivo</I>. Heterozygous <I>Rheb1</I> knockout in male <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice reproduced the results observed with pharmacological treatment. These results suggest that the Rheb1 activation may be responsible for synaptic abnormalities and memory impairments in <I>Tsc2</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice, and its inhibition by lonafarnib could provide insight into potential treatment options for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant disease that causes neuropsychiatric symptoms, including intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID) and autism. No pharmacological treatment for ID has been reported so far. To develop a pharmacological treatment for ID, we investigated the mechanism of TSC and found that Rheb1 activation is responsible for synaptic abnormalities in TSC neurons. To inhibit Rheb1 function, we used the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib, because farnesylation of Rheb1 is required for its activation. Lonafarnib treatment increased inactive Rheb1 and recovered proper synapse formation and plasticity-related Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) expression in TSC neurons. Furthermore, <I>in vivo</I> lonafarnib treatment restored contextual memory and Arc induction in TSC mice. Together, Rheb1 inhibition by lonafarnib could provide insight into potential treatments for TSC-associated ID.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting mutational allosteric effects in alkaline phosphatases associated with different Hypophosphatasia phenotypes: An integrative computational investigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fei Xiao, Ziyun Zhou, Xingyu Song, Mi Gan, Jie Long, Gennady Verkhivker, Guang Hu</p>

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and is highly variable in its clinical phenotype. The disease occurs due to various loss-of-function mutations in <i>ALPL</i>, the gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In this work, a data-driven and biophysics-based approach is proposed for the large-scale analysis of <i>ALPL</i> mutations-from nonpathogenic to severe HPPs. By using a pipeline of synergistic approaches including sequence-structure analysis, network modeling, elastic network models and atomistic simulations, we characterized allosteric signatures and effects of the <i>ALPL</i> mutations on protein dynamics and function. Statistical analysis of molecular features computed for the <i>ALPL</i> mutations showed a significant difference between the control, mild and severe HPP phenotypes. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with protein structure network analysis were employed to analyze the effect of single-residue variation on conformational dynamics of TNSALP dimers, and the developed machine learning model suggested that the topological network parameters could serve as a robust indicator of severe mutations. The results indicated that the severity of disease-associated mutations is often linked with mutation-induced modulation of allosteric communications in the protein. This study suggested that <i>ALPL</i> mutations associated with mild and more severe HPPs can exert markedly distinct effects on the protein stability and long-range network communications. By linking the disease phenotypes with dynamic and allosteric molecular signatures, the proposed integrative computational approach enabled to characterize and quantify the allosteric effects of <i>ALPL</i> mutations and role of allostery in the pathogenesis of HPPs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interactions between sensory prediction error and task error during implicit motor learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan S. Tsay, Adrian M. Haith, Richard B. Ivry, Hyosub E. Kim</p>

Implicit motor recalibration allows us to flexibly move in novel and changing environments. Conventionally, implicit recalibration is thought to be driven by errors in predicting the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors). However, recent studies have shown that implicit recalibration is also influenced by errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Exactly how sensory prediction errors and task errors interact to drive implicit recalibration and, in particular, whether task errors alone might be sufficient to drive implicit recalibration remain unknown. To test this, we induced task errors in the absence of sensory prediction errors by displacing the target mid-movement. We found that task errors alone failed to induce implicit recalibration. In additional experiments, we simultaneously varied the size of sensory prediction errors and task errors. We found that implicit recalibration driven by sensory prediction errors could be continuously modulated by task errors, revealing an unappreciated dependency between these two sources of error. Moreover, implicit recalibration was attenuated when the target was simply flickered in its original location, even though this manipulation did not affect task error–an effect likely attributed to attention being directed away from the feedback cursor. Taken as a whole, the results were accounted for by a computational model in which sensory prediction errors and task errors, modulated by attention, interact to determine the extent of implicit recalibration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">COMMIT: Consideration of metabolite leakage and community composition improves microbial community reconstructions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philipp Wendering, Zoran Nikoloski</p>

Composition and functions of microbial communities affect important traits in diverse hosts, from crops to humans. Yet, mechanistic understanding of how metabolism of individual microbes is affected by the community composition and metabolite leakage is lacking. Here, we first show that the consensus of automatically generated metabolic reconstructions improves the quality of the draft reconstructions, measured by comparison to reference models. We then devise an approach for gap filling, termed COMMIT, that considers metabolites for secretion based on their permeability and the composition of the community. By applying COMMIT with two soil communities from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> culture collection, we could significantly reduce the gap-filling solution in comparison to filling gaps in individual reconstructions without affecting the genomic support. Inspection of the metabolic interactions in the soil communities allows us to identify microbes with community roles of helpers and beneficiaries. Therefore, COMMIT offers a versatile fully automated solution for large-scale modelling of microbial communities for diverse biotechnological applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mitochondria transplantation between living cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph G. Gäbelein, Qian Feng, Edin Sarajlic, Tomaso Zambelli, Orane Guillaume-Gentil, Benoît Kornmann, Julia A. Vorholt</p>

Mitochondria and the complex endomembrane system are hallmarks of eukaryotic cells. To date, it has been difficult to manipulate organelle structures within single live cells. We developed a FluidFM-based approach to extract, inject, and transplant organelles from and into living cells with subcellular spatial resolution. The technology combines atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, and nanofluidics to achieve force and volume control with real-time inspection. We developed dedicated probes that allow minimally invasive entry into cells and optimized fluid flow to extract specific organelles. When extracting single or a defined number of mitochondria, their morphology transforms into a pearls-on-a-string phenotype due to locally applied fluidic forces. We show that the induced transition is calcium independent and results in isolated, intact mitochondria. Upon cell-to-cell transplantation, the transferred mitochondria fuse to the host cells mitochondrial network. Transplantation of healthy and drug-impaired mitochondria into primary keratinocytes allowed monitoring of mitochondrial subpopulation rescue. Fusion with the mitochondrial network of recipient cells occurred 20 minutes after transplantation and continued for over 16 hours. After transfer of mitochondria and cell propagation over generations, donor mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was replicated in recipient cells without the need for selection pressure. The approach opens new prospects for the study of organelle physiology and homeostasis, but also for therapy, mechanobiology, and synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical waves mediate the cellular response to electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Electrotaxis, the directional migration of cells in a constant electric field, is important in regeneration, development, and wound healing. Electrotaxis has a slower response and a smaller dynamic range than guidance by other cues, suggesting that the mechanism of electrotaxis shares both similarities and differences with chemical-gradient-sensing pathways. We examine a mechanism centered on the excitable system consisting of cortical waves of biochemical signals coupled to cytoskeletal reorganization, which has been implicated in random cell motility. We use electro-fused giant <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells to decouple waves from cell motion and employ nanotopographic surfaces to limit wave dimensions and lifetimes. We demonstrate that wave propagation in these cells is guided by electric fields. The wave area and lifetime gradually increase in the first 10 min after an electric field is turned on, leading to more abundant and wider protrusions in the cell region nearest the cathode. The wave directions display ‘U-turn’ behavior upon field reversal, and this switch occurs more quickly on nanotopography. Our results suggest that electric fields guide cells by controlling waves of signal transduction and cytoskeletal activity, which underlie cellular protrusions. Whereas surface receptor occupancy triggers both rapid activation and slower polarization of signaling pathways, electric fields appear to act primarily on polarization, explaining why cells respond to electric fields more slowly than to other guidance cues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual signaling via interferon and DNA damage response elicits entrapment by giant PML nuclear bodies</a></h4>

              
                PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are dynamic interchromosomal macromolecular complexes implicated in epigenetic regulation as well as antiviral defense. During herpesvirus infection, PML-NBs induce epigenetic silencing of viral genomes, however, this defense is antagonized by viral regulatory proteins such as IE1 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we show that PML-NBs undergo a drastic rearrangement into highly enlarged PML cages upon infection with IE1-deficient HCMV. Importantly, our results demonstrate that dual signaling by interferon and DNA damage response is required to elicit giant PML-NBs. DNA labeling revealed that invading HCMV genomes are entrapped inside PML-NBs and remain stably associated with PML cages in a transcriptionally repressed state. Intriguingly, by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy (EM), we observed that PML cages also entrap newly assembled viral capsids demonstrating a second defense layer in cells with incomplete first line response. Further characterization by 3D EM showed that hundreds of viral capsids are tightly packed into several layers of fibrous PML. Overall, our data indicate that giant PML-NBs arise via combined interferon and DNA damage signaling which triggers entrapment of both nucleic acids and proteinaceous components. This represents a multilayered defense strategy to act in a cytoprotective manner and to combat viral infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary conservation of centriole rotational asymmetry in the human centrosome</a></h4>

              
                Centrioles are formed by microtubule triplets in a nine-fold symmetric arrangement. In flagellated protists and in animal multiciliated cells, accessory structures tethered to specific triplets render the centrioles rotationally asymmetric, a property that is key to cytoskeletal and cellular organization in these contexts. In contrast, centrioles within the centrosome of animal cells display no conspicuous rotational asymmetry. Here, we uncover rotationally asymmetric molecular features in human centrioles. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we show that LRRCC1, the ortholog of a protein originally characterized in flagellate green algae, associates preferentially to two consecutive triplets in the distal lumen of human centrioles. LRRCC1 partially co-localizes and affects the recruitment of another distal component, C2CD3, which also has an asymmetric localization pattern in the centriole lumen. Together, LRRCC1 and C2CD3 delineate a structure reminiscent of a filamentous density observed by electron microscopy in flagellates, termed the 'acorn'. Functionally, the depletion of LRRCC1 in human cells induced defects in centriole structure, ciliary assembly and ciliary signaling, supporting that LRRCC1 cooperates with C2CD3 to organizing the distal region of centrioles. Since a mutation in the <i>LRRCC1</i> gene has been identified in Joubert syndrome patients, this finding is relevant in the context of human ciliopathies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that rotational asymmetry is an ancient property of centrioles that is broadly conserved in human cells. Our work also reveals that asymmetrically localized proteins are key for primary ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling in human cells.

                The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to rage around the world. At the same time, despite strong public health measures and high vaccination rates in some countries, a post-COVID-19 syndrome has emerged which lacks a clear definition, prevalence, or etiology. However, fatigue, dyspnea, brain fog, and lack of smell and/or taste are often characteristic of patients with this syndrome. These are evident more than a month after infection, and are labeled as <i>Post-Acute Sequelae of CoV-2</i> (PASC) or commonly referred to as long-COVID. Metabolic dysfunction (i.e., obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus) is a predisposing risk factor for severe acute COVID-19, and there is emerging evidence that this factor plus a chronic inflammatory state may predispose to PASC. In this article, we explore the potential pathogenic metabolic mechanisms that could underly both severe acute COVID-19 and PASC, and then consider how these might be targeted for future therapeutic approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bayesian machine learning analysis of single-molecule fluorescence colocalization images</a></h4>

              
                Multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence colocalization (CoSMoS) methods allow elucidation of complex biochemical reaction mechanisms. However, analysis of CoSMoS data is intrinsically challenging because of low image signal-to-noise ratios, non-specific surface binding of the fluorescent molecules, and analysis methods that require subjective inputs to achieve accurate results. Here, we use Bayesian probabilistic programming to implement Tapqir, an unsupervised machine learning method that incorporates a holistic, physics-based causal model of CoSMoS data. This method accounts for uncertainties in image analysis due to photon and camera noise, optical non-uniformities, non-specific binding, and spot detection. Rather than merely producing a binary 'spot/no spot' classification of unspecified reliability, Tapqir objectively assigns spot classification probabilities that allow accurate downstream analysis of molecular dynamics, thermodynamics, and kinetics. We both quantitatively validate Tapqir performance against simulated CoSMoS image data with known properties and also demonstrate that it implements fully objective, automated analysis of experiment-derived data sets with a wide range of signal, noise, and non-specific binding characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dendritic branch structure compartmentalizes voltage-dependent calcium influx in cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) regulate synaptic plasticity by evoking voltage-dependent calcium influx throughout dendrites. Attenuation of bAP amplitude in distal dendritic compartments alters plasticity in a location-specific manner by reducing bAP-dependent calcium influx. However, it is not known if neurons exhibit branch-specific variability in bAP-dependent calcium signals, independent of distance-dependent attenuation. Here, we reveal that bAPs fail to evoke calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in a specific population of dendritic branches in mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, despite evoking substantial VGCC-mediated calcium influx in sister branches. These branches contain VGCCs and successfully propagate bAPs in the absence of synaptic input; nevertheless, they fail to exhibit bAP-evoked calcium influx due to a branch-specific reduction in bAP amplitude. We demonstrate that these branches have more elaborate branch structure compared to sister branches, which causes a local reduction in electrotonic impedance and bAP amplitude. Finally, we show that bAPs still amplify synaptically-mediated calcium influx in these branches because of differences in the voltage-dependence and kinetics of VGCCs and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Branch-specific compartmentalization of bAP-dependent calcium signals may provide a mechanism for neurons to diversify synaptic tuning across the dendritic tree.

                The leading view in the somatosensory system indicates that area 3b serves as a cortical relay site that encodes cutaneous (tactile) features limited to individual digits. Our recent work argues against this model by showing that cells in area 3b integrate information from cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities. Here, we further test this model, by studying the multi-finger neural integration properties of area 3b. In contrast to the prevailing view, we found that most cells in area 3b have a receptive field (RF) that extends to multiple digits. Responses to tactile stimulation emerged earlier in cells with a multi-digit (MD) vs. single-digit (SD) RF. We also found that the RF size of MD cells (the number of responsive digits) increased across time, and the orientation preference across digits was highly correlated. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that area 3b plays a larger role in generating neural representations of tactile objects, as opposed to just being a "feature detector" relay site.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory dynamics underlying emotion-cognition integration: differential role of theta and alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental aspect of human mental life is the seamless ability for integration of emotion and cognition. Despite progress regarding the spatial architecture of Emotion-Cognition Integration (ECI), the time course of ECI processes remains unclear. To examine the temporal organization of brain oscillations underpinning ECI, we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence of stimuli and cognitive task demand while recording electrophysiological responses of 61 participants. They were asked to complete tasks with low (body-part judgement) and high (laterality judgement) cognitive demand while viewing other people photographs that varied on dimensions of laterality (left or right), body-part (hand or foot), and emotional valence (pain or no pain). We found increased reaction times and error rates in pain versus no pain during laterality judgement relative to body-part judgement, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between emotion and cognition. EEG results showed that 1) emotion processing (valence) occurred first in the theta band from 144 to 372 ms; 2) cognitive processing (laterality) took place in the theta band from 332 to 608 ms; 3) emotional and cognitive processes were integrated in the alpha band from 268 ms and lasted to 800 ms. These findings reveal oscillatory dynamics of the processing and integration of emotion and cognition, providing further insights into the underlying neurophysiology. This may ultimately contribute to our understanding of ECI processing in psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information maximization explains state-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory reorganization during non-rapid eye movement sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow waves during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflect the alternating up and down states of cortical neurons; global and local slow waves promote memory consolidation and forgetting, respectively. Furthermore, distinct spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) operates in these up and down states. The contribution of different plasticity rules to neural information coding and memory reorganization remains unknown. Here, we show that optimal synaptic plasticity for information maximization in a cortical neuron model provides a unified explanation for these phenomena. The model indicates that the optimal synaptic plasticity is biased towards depression as the baseline firing rate increases. This property explains the distinct STDP observed in the up and down states. Furthermore, it explains how global and local slow waves predominantly potentiate and depress synapses, respectively, if the background firing rate of excitatory neurons declines with the spatial scale of waves as the model predicts. The model provides a unifying account of the role of NREM sleep, bridging neural information coding, synaptic plasticity, and memory reorganization.

                Hydrogen peroxide is the most common reactive chemical that organisms face on the microbial battlefield. The rate with which hydrogen peroxide damages biomolecules required for life increases with temperature, yet little is known about how organisms cope with this temperature-dependent threat. Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes use temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide produced by the pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecium. These nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This strategy, which we call "enhancer sensing," is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical.

                In high-risk environments, fast and accurate responses to warning systems are essential to efficiently handle emergency situations and prevent potential catastrophic events. The aim of the present experiment was twofold: 1) investigating whether hand action videos, referred as to gesture alarms, are more efficient to trigger fast and accurate responses than text alarm messages (referred as written alarms), especially when the mental workload is high; and 2) investigating the brain activity in response to both types of alarms as a function of the level of mental workload. Regardless the level of mental workload, participants were found to be both faster and more accurate when responding to the gesture alarms than to the written alarms. Brain electrophysiological results suggest that this greater efficiency might be due to the fact that (compared to written alarms) gesture alarms facilitate the action execution reflected by the mu and beta power decrease observed around the response time window. Taken together, these results demonstrate that gesture alarm systems may help improving operators performances in emergency situations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Galanin Analogs Prevent Seizure-Induced Respiratory Arrest</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 20% of mortality in those with recurrent seizures. While risk factors, monitoring systems, and standard practices are in place, the pathophysiology of SUDEP is still not well understood. Better knowledge of SUDEP and its potential mechanisms of action is crucial to reducing risk in this patient population and developing potential treatment options. Clinical studies and animal models of SUDEP suggest that diminished post-ictal respiratory control may be the dominant mechanism contributing to mortality. Recently, it was demonstrated that the depletion of the neuropeptide galanin in the amygdala occurs in human SUDEP. The amygdala plays a key role in the central integration of respiratory signaling; the depletion of galanin may represent a critical change that predisposes individuals to SUDEP. Methods: To evaluate the potential benefit of enhancing galaninergic signaling as a means to protect against SUDEP, we studied seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) following central (intracerebroventricular, intra-amygdala) and systemic (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous) administration of galanin agonists. Seizure naive and seizure experienced (fully kindled) mice were tested. Results: Central and systemically-administered galanin analogs protect against S-IRA in naive C57Bl/6J mice. Differential efficacy between receptor subtype-selective analogs varied based on the route of administration. Sub-chronic systemic administration at doses that reduced 6 Hz seizures also protected against S-IRA. Acute treatment benefits also extended to fully kindled mice subjected to tonic extension. Significance: These data demonstrate that galanin agonists may be protective against post-ictal respiratory collapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rethinking the Methods and Algorithms for Inner Speech Decoding - and Making them Reproducible</a></h4>

              
                This study focuses on the automatic decoding of inner speech using noninvasive methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG)). While inner speech has been a research topic in philosophy and psychology for half a century, recent attempts have been made to decode nonvoiced spoken words by using various brain-computer interfaces. Although good accuracy has been reported in some cases (up to 90% for a binary task), results are often just above chance level (approximately 20% for 5 vowels). The main shortcomings of existing work are reproducibility and the availability of data and code. In this work, we investigate various methods (using deep Learning and standard classifiers) for the detection task of 5 vowels and 6 words on a publicly available EEG dataset. The main contribution of this work lies in its extensive experimentation and analysis. We analyse (1) subject dependent vs. subject-independent approaches, (2) the effect of different preprocessing steps (Independent Component Analysis (ICA), down-sampling and filtering), and (3) word classification (where we achieve state-of-the-art performance). Overall we achieve a performance accuracy of 35.20% when classifying the 5 vowels and 29.21% when classifying the 6 words, using our proposed iSpeech-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and preprocessing methodology without downsampling. All of our code and processed data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility. As such, this work contributes to a deeper understanding and reproducibility of experiments in the 16 area of inner speech detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and sensorimotor associations along the 'where pathway</a></h4>

              
                Visually guided behaviors require the brain to transform ambiguous retinal images into object-level spatial representations and implement sensorimotor transformations. These processes are supported by the dorsal  where pathway. However, the specific functional contributions of areas along this pathway remain elusive due in part to methodological differences across studies. We previously showed that macaque caudal intraparietal (CIP) area neurons possess robust three-dimensional (3D) visual representations, carry choice-related and presaccadic activity, and exhibit experience-dependent sensorimotor associations (Chang et al., 2020b). Here, we used a common experimental design to reveal parallel processing, hierarchical transformations, and the formation of sensorimotor associations along the  where pathway by extending the investigation to V3A, a major feedforward input to CIP. Higher-level 3D representations and choice-related activity were more prevalent in CIP than V3A. Both areas contained presaccadic activity that predicted the direction/timing of eye movements. Intriguingly, the time-course of presaccadic activity in CIP aligned with the temporally integrated V3A output. Sensorimotor associations between 3D orientation and saccade direction preferences were strongest in CIP and moderated by choice signals in both areas. Together, the results explicate parallel representations, hierarchical transformations, and functional associations of visual and presaccadic signals at a key juncture in the  where pathway.

	<p>In a recent paper, Share discussed four different &amp;amp;ldquo;Common Misconceptions about the Phonological Deficit Theory of Dyslexia&amp;amp;rdquo; and described this theory as &amp;amp;ldquo;a model of true scientific progress&amp;amp;rdquo; and a clear &amp;amp;ldquo;success story&amp;amp;rdquo;. In this note, I argue that at least part of the success of this theory is due to the lack of explicit predictions which make it very difficult (if possible) to test its predictions, and, possibly, falsify the theory. Some areas of pertinent research, including categorical phoneme perception, picture naming, and phonological awareness are summarized. Furthermore, two lines of research in which groups of researchers have attempted to formulate more explicit predictions are briefly outlined. It is concluded that, although much research has variously referred to the phonological deficit theory of dyslexia, the resulting large body of evidence presents a complex pattern of results which, in the absence of an explicit formulation of the theory, is extremely difficult to frame within a unitary interpretation. Overall, what seems needed is a theoretical formulation that, on the one hand, can account for the complex pattern of available evidence and, on the other hand, provide testable predictions for future research.</p>

	<p>Sleep inertia (SI) refers to a complex psychophysiological phenomenon observed after morning awakening that can be described as the gradual recovery of waking-like status after a night of sleep. The time course of SI dissipation in an everyday life condition is little studied. The present study aims to investigate the SI dissipation in motor activity, as a function of age, upon spontaneous morning awakening after a usual night-time sleep. To this end, we performed a retrospective study in a naturalistic setting in a wide life span sample: 382 healthy participants (219 females) from middle childhood (9 years old) to late adulthood (70 years old). Participants were required to wear the actigraph on the non-dominant wrist for at least seven consecutive nights. Results show that SI of motor activity is dissipated in 70 min. Mean motor activity in such a time window was significantly modulated by age: lower age corresponded to higher motor activity.</p>

	<p>The promotion of recovery in patients who have entered a disorder of consciousness (DOC; e.g., coma or vegetative states) following severe brain injury remains an enduring medical challenge despite an ever-growing scientific understanding of these conditions. Indeed, recent work has consistently implicated altered cortical modulation by deep brain structures (e.g., the thalamus and the basal ganglia) following brain damage in the arising of, and recovery from, DOCs. The (re)emergence of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) neuromodulation may provide a means to selectively modulate the activity of deep brain structures noninvasively for the study and treatment of DOCs. This technique is unique in its combination of relatively high spatial precision and noninvasive implementation. Given the consistent implication of the thalamus in DOCs and prior results inducing behavioral recovery through invasive thalamic stimulation, here we applied ultrasound to the central thalamus in 11 acute DOC patients, measured behavioral responsiveness before and after sonication, and applied functional MRI during sonication. With respect to behavioral responsiveness, we observed significant recovery in the week following thalamic LIFU compared with baseline. With respect to functional imaging, we found decreased BOLD signals in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia during LIFU compared with baseline. In addition, we also found a relationship between altered connectivity of the sonicated thalamus and the degree of recovery observed post-LIFU.</p>

	<p>Previous production studies have reported differential amounts of closure voicing in plosives depending on the location of the oral constriction (anterior vs. posterior), vocalic context (high vs. low vowels), and speaker sex. Such differences have been attributed to the aerodynamic factors related to the configuration of the cavity behind the oral constriction, with certain articulations and physiological characteristics of the speaker facilitating vocal fold vibration during closure. The current study used perceptual identification tasks to examine whether similar effects of consonantal posteriority, adjacent vowel height, and speaker sex exist in the perception of voicing. The language of investigation was Russian, a prevoicing language that uses negative VOT to signal the voicing contrast in plosives. The study used both original and resynthesized tokens for speaker sex, which allowed it to focus on the role of differences in VOT specifically. Results indicated that listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; judgments were significantly affected by consonantal place of articulation, with listeners accepting less voicing in velar plosives. Speaker sex showed only a marginally significant difference in the expected direction, and vowel height had no effect on perceptual responses. These findings suggest that certain phonetic factors can affect both the initial production and subsequent perception of closure voicing.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is a well-known pathological entity in clinical practice. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind tinnitus seem to be elusive and cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. Hence, in the present study, we explore the mathematical model of ions&amp;amp;rsquo; quantum tunneling to propose an original pathophysiological mechanism for the sensation of tinnitus. The present model focuses on two major aspects: The first aspect is the ability of ions, including sodium, potassium, and calcium, to depolarize the membrane potential of inner hair cells and the neurons of the auditory pathway. This membrane depolarization is induced via the quantum tunneling of ions through closed voltage-gated channels. The state of membrane depolarization can be a state of hyper-excitability or hypo-excitability, depending on the degree of depolarization. Both of these states aid in understanding the pathophysiology of tinnitus. The second aspect is the quantum tunneling signals between the demyelinated neurons of the auditory pathway. These signals are mediated via the quantum tunneling of potassium ions, which exit to the extracellular fluid during an action potential event. These quantum signals can be viewed as a &amp;amp;ldquo;quantum synapse&amp;amp;rdquo; between neurons. The formation of quantum synapses results in hyper-excitability among the demyelinated neurons of the auditory pathway. Both of these aspects augment and amplify the electrical signals in the auditory pathway and result in a loss of the spatiotemporal fidelity of sound signals going to the brain centers. The brain interprets this hyper-excitability and loss of spatiotemporal fidelity as tinnitus. Herein, we show mathematically that the quantum tunneling of ions can depolarize the membrane potential of the inner hair cells and neurons of the auditory pathway. Moreover, we calculate the probability of action potential induction in the neurons of the auditory pathway generated by the quantum tunneling signals of potassium ions.</p>

<p>Interleukin-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) through the activation of microglia. It is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is thought to be associated with inflammation in many neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke and poststroke depression, but the role of IL-18 in inflammatory injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this study, we established the ICH model in male mice and found that IL-18 expression including protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in brain tissues after ICH. Meanwhile, exogenous IL-18 exacerbated cerebral hematoma and neurological deficits following ICH. In the IL-18 knockout group, the size of hematoma and neurological functions after ICH was decreased compared with the wild-type group, suggesting the critical role of IL-18 on the modulation of brain injury after ICH. Importantly, exogenous IL-18 increased microglial activation in brain tissues after ICH. Furthermore, IL-18 knockout resulted in the reduction of activated microglia after ICH. These results indicated that IL-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after ICH through the activation of microglia. Thus, IL-18 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>

     alt="Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging quantification of gray matter alterations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging-derived myelin volume fraction, we showed gray matter alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Our findings suggested extensive neuroinflammation, along with a lesser extent demyelination and neuronal loss in RRMS. In contrast, we observed substantial neuronal loss with no evidence of demyelination and neuroinflammation in NMOSD.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Herein, we combined neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) to evaluate the spatial distribution and extent of gray matter (GM) microstructural alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The NODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index [ODI], and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and SyMRI (myelin volume fraction [MVF]) measures were compared between age- and sex-matched groups of 30 patients with RRMS (6 males and 24 females; mean age, 51.43 ± 8.02 years), 18 patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD (2 males and 16 females; mean age, 52.67 ± 16.07 years), and 19 healthy controls (6 males and 13 females; mean age, 51.47 ± 9.25 years) using GM-based spatial statistical analysis. Patients with RRMS showed reduced NDI and MVF and increased ODI and ISOVF, predominantly in the limbic and paralimbic regions, when compared with healthy controls, while only increases in ODI and ISOVF were observed when compared with NMOSD. Compared to NDI and MVF, the changes in ODI and ISOVF were observed more widely, including in the cerebellar cortex. These abnormalities were associated with disease progression and disability. In contrast, patients with NMOSD only showed reduced NDI mainly in the cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic cortices when compared with healthy controls and patients with RRMS. Taken together, our study supports the notion that GM pathologies in RRMS are distinct from those of NMOSD. However, owing to the limitations of the study, the results should be cautiously interpreted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Behavioral Responding and Dopamine Release during Pavlovian Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning associations between cues and rewards require the mesolimbic dopamine system. The dopamine response to cues signals differences in reward value in well trained animals. However, these value-related dopamine responses are absent during early training sessions when cues signal differences in the reward rate. These findings suggest cue-evoked dopamine release conveys differences between outcomes only after extensive training, though it is unclear whether this is unique to when cues signal differences in reward rate, or whether this is also evident when cues signal differences in other value-related parameters such as reward size. To address this, we used a Pavlovian conditioning task in which one audio cue was associated with a small reward (one pellet) and another audio cue was associated with a large reward (three pellets). We performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to record changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of male and female rats throughout learning. While female rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding, a faster latency to respond, and elevated post-reward head entries relative to male rats, there were no sex differences in the dopamine response to cues. Multiple training sessions were required before cue-evoked dopamine release signaled differences in reward size. Reward-evoked dopamine release scaled with reward size, though females displayed lower reward-evoked dopamine responses relative to males. Conditioned responding related to the decrease in the peak reward-evoked dopamine response and not to cue-evoked dopamine release. Collectively, these data illustrate sex differences in behavioral responding as well as in reward-evoked dopamine release during Pavlovian learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Stimulus Generalization in Mice during Pavlovian Eyeblink Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we investigate stimulus generalization in a cerebellar learning paradigm, called eyeblink conditioning. Mice were conditioned to close their eyes in response to a 10-kHz tone by repeatedly pairing this tone with an air puff to the eye 250 ms after tone onset. After 10 consecutive days of training, when mice showed reliable conditioned eyelid responses to the 10-kHz tone, we started to expose them to tones with other frequencies, ranging from 2 to 20 kHz. We found that mice had a strong generalization gradient, whereby the probability and amplitude of conditioned eyelid responses gradually decreases depending on the dissimilarity with the 10-kHz tone. Tones with frequencies closest to 10 kHz evoked the most and largest conditioned eyelid responses and each step away from the 10-kHz tone resulted in fewer and smaller conditioned responses (CRs). In addition, we found that tones with lower frequencies resulted in CRs that peaked earlier after tone onset compared with those to tones with higher frequencies. Together, our data show prominent generalization patterns in cerebellar learning. Since the known function of cerebellum is rapidly expanding from pure motor control to domains that include cognition, reward-learning, fear-learning, social function, and even addiction, our data imply generalization controlled by cerebellum in all these domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Incorporating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for GWAS data: A controlled analysis with the MAGMA tool</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Groenewoud, Avinoam Shye, Ran Elkon</p>

To date, genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of statistically-significant associations between genetic variants, and phenotypes related to a myriad of traits and diseases. A key goal for human-genetics research is to translate these associations into functional mechanisms. Popular gene-set analysis tools, like MAGMA, map variants to genes they might affect, and then integrate genome-wide association study data (that is, variant-level associations for a phenotype) to score genes for association with a phenotype. Gene scores are subsequently used in competitive gene-set analyses to identify biological processes that are enriched for phenotype association. By default, variants are mapped to genes in their proximity. However, many variants that affect phenotypes are thought to act at regulatory elements, which can be hundreds of kilobases away from their target genes. Thus, we explored the idea of augmenting a proximity-based mapping scheme with publicly-available datasets of regulatory interactions. We used MAGMA to analyze genome-wide association study data for ten different phenotypes, and evaluated the effects of augmentation by comparing numbers, and identities, of genes and gene sets detected as statistically significant between mappings. We detected several pitfalls and confounders of such “augmented analyses”, and introduced ways to control for them. Using these controls, we demonstrated that augmentation with datasets of regulatory interactions only occasionally strengthened the enrichment for phenotype association amongst (biologically-relevant) gene sets for different phenotypes. Still, in such cases, genes and regulatory elements responsible for the improvement could be pinpointed. For instance, using brain regulatory-interactions for augmentation, we were able to implicate two acetylcholine receptor subunits involved in post-synaptic chemical transmission, namely <i>CHRNB2</i> and <i>CHRNE</i>, in schizophrenia. Collectively, our study presents a critical approach for integrating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for genome-wide association study data, by introducing various controls to distinguish genuine results from spurious discoveries.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The encephalitis associated with antibodies against contactin-associated proteinlike 2 (CASPR2) is presumably antibody-mediated, but the antibody effects and whether they cause behavioral alterations are not well known. Here, we used a mouse model of patients' immunoglobulin G (IgG) transfer and super-resolution microscopy to demonstrate the antibody pathogenicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis or healthy controls was infused into the cerebroventricular system of mice. The levels and colocalization of CASPR2 with transient axonal glycoprotein 1 (TAG1) were determined with stimulated emission depletion microscopy (40–70μm lateral resolution). Hippocampal clusters of Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) and GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) were quantified with confocal microscopy. Behavioral alterations were assessed with standard behavioral paradigms. Cultured neurons were used to determine the levels of intracellular CASPR2 and TAG1 after exposure to patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Infusion of patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, caused memory impairment along with hippocampal reduction of surface CASPR2 clusters and decreased CASPR2/TAG1 colocalization. In cultured neurons, patients' IgG led to an increase of intracellular CASPR2 without affecting TAG1, suggesting selective CASPR2 internalization. Additionally, mice infused with patients' IgG showed decreased levels of Kv1.1 and GluA1 (two CASPR2-regulated proteins). All these alterations and the memory deficit reverted to normal after removing patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis causes reversible memory impairment, inhibits the interaction of CASPR2/TAG1, and decreases the levels of CASPR2 and related proteins (VGKC, AMPAR). These findings fulfill the postulates of antibody-mediated disease and provide a biological basis for antibody-removing treatment approaches. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Increased susceptibility to quinolinic acid-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations in an animal model of glutaric acidemia type I"/>
<p>Following quinolinic acid (QA) intrastriatal injection, glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) animal model is more susceptible to QA-induced severe seizures, develops spontaneous recurrent seizures, and presents increased mortality rate and persistent changes in brain cortical oscillation patterns. This emphasizes the crucial role of QA in neurological impairment in GA-I</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) is an inborn error of metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, caused by glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, characterized by the buildup of toxic organic acids predominantly in the brain. After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice taking high-lysine diet (<i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>-</i>Lys, <i>Gcdh<sup>+/+</sup>-</i>Lys, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures <i>per</i> animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA, <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA and 44% of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA mice. All <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The disorder is four times more common in males than in females. Zinc deficiency and mutations in <i>SHANK2</i> and <i>SHANK3</i> (members of a family of excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins) are all risk factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. The presence of shankopathies (loss of one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene) can lead to the development of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS)—a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, poor motor tone, and ASD-like symptoms. We reviewed the relationship between zinc, ASD, and PMDS as well as the effect of zinc supplementation in improving symptoms of ASD and PMDS based on 22 studies published within 6 years (2015–2020). Zinc deficiency (assessed by either dietary intake, blood, hair, or tooth matrix) was shown to be highly prevalent in ASD and PMDS patients as well as in preclinical models of ASD and PMDS. Zinc supplements improved the behavioral deficits in animal models of ASD and PMDS. Clinical trials are still needed to validate the beneficial therapeutic effects of zinc supplements in ASD and PMDS patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Regulation of AMPAR trafficking in synaptic plasticity by BDNF and the impact of neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research demonstrates that the neural mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and learning and memory involve mobilization of AMPA-type neurotransmitter receptors at glutamatergic synaptic contacts, and that these mechanisms are targeted during neurodegenerative disease. Strengthening neural transmission occurs with insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into synapses while weakening results from receptor withdrawal. A key player in the trafficking of AMPARs during plasticity and learning is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling system. BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that supports neuronal growth and is required for learning and memory. Significantly, a primary feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a reduction in BDNF protein as well as disrupted neuronal surface expression of synaptic AMPARs. The resulting weakening of synaptic contacts leads to synapse loss and neuronal degeneration that underlies the cognitive impairment and dementia observed in patients with progressive neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s. In the face of these data, one therapeutic approach is to increase BDNF bioavailability in brain. While this has been met with significant challenges, the results of the research have been promising. In spite of this, there are currently no clinical trials to test many of these findings on patients. Here, research showing that BDNF drives AMPARs to synapses, AMPAR trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity and learning, and that neurodegenerative disease results in a significant decline in BDNF will be reviewed. The aim is to draw attention to the need for increasing patient-directed clinical studies to test the possible benefits of increasing levels of neurotrophins, specifically BDNF, to treat brain disorders. Much is known about the cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in brain. It can be concluded that signaling by neurotrophins like BDNF and AMPA-type glutamate receptor synaptic trafficking are fundamental to these processes. Data from animal models and patients reveal that these mechanisms are adversely targeted during neurodegenerative disease and results in memory loss and cognitive decline. A brief summary of our understanding of these mechanisms indicates that it is time to apply this knowledge base directly to development of therapeutic treatments that enhance neurotrophins for brain disorders in patient populations.</p>

     alt="Comparison of prefrontal cortex sucrose seeking ensembles engaged in multiple seeking sessions: Context is key"/>
<p>TetTag mice self-administered sucrose, then underwent two seeking sessions either in the same or distinct environments. Reactivation of a prelimbic cortex ensemble tagged during the first seeking session shifted from being proportional to operant responding (cue reactivity) in the same context to goal directed (sucrose retrieval responding) in the distinct context.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding of memories, including those associated with prior drug or reward, is thought to take place within distinct populations of neurons, termed ensembles. Neuronal ensembles for drug- and reward-seeking have been identified in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, but much of our understanding of these ensembles is based on experiments that take place in a single reward-associated environment and measure ensemble encoding over short durations of time. In contrast, reward seeking behavior is evident across different reward-associated environments and persists over time. Using TetTag mice and Fos immunohistochemistry, we examined the relationship between persistent sucrose-seeking and ensemble encoding in mice that undergo seeking sessions in the same or different sucrose self-administration contexts 2 weeks apart. We found that prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate cortex ensembles tagged in the first seeking session were highly sensitive to the context in which a second seeking session took place: reactivation of these ensembles was reduced in the same context but elevated in a distinct sucrose self-administration context. Correlational analyses revealed that ensemble reactivation in the PrL was proportional to the persistence of sucrose seeking behavior across sessions in differing ways in female mice. In the same context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced operant responses, whereas in a distinct context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced head entries into the sucrose receptacle. This study underlines the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex importance in maintaining a reward-seeking ensemble over time and identifies context-dependent changes in behavioral correlates of ensemble reactivation.</p>

     alt="Tau nuclear translocation is a leading step in tau pathology process through P53 stabilization and nucleolar dispersion"/>
<p>P53 is typically degraded by proteasomes, with Mdm2 playing a significant role. Under tauopathy stress, pathogenic P-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau, AT8, and AT100 P-tau) are formed in the neurites. They gradually moved from the neurites into the soma and nucleus. P-tau nuclear mislocalization is accompanied by p53 stabilization, bax, and cleaved caspase-3 formation, and significant nucleolar dispersion, ultimately leading to neuron death. <i>Cis</i>Pt, <i>Cis</i> P-tau; AT8, AT8 P-tau; AT100, AT100 P-tau; CBax, cleaved bax; CCasp3, cleaved caspase-3; Cytoc, Cytochrome c.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tau protein abnormalities are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In tau-overexpressing SHSY5Y cells and iPSC-derived neuron models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), axonal tau translocates into the nuclear compartment, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which tau translocation results in neurodegeneration remain elusive thus far. We studied the nuclear displacement of different P-tau species [<i>Cis</i> phosphorylated Thr231-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau), phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205-tau (AT8 P-tau), and phosphorylated Thr212/Ser214-tau (AT100 P-tau)] at various time points using starvation in primary cortical neurons and single severe TBI (ssTBI) in male mouse cerebral cortices as tauopathy models. While all P-tau species translocated into the somatodendritic compartment in response to stress, <i>cis</i> P-tau did so more rapidly than the other species. Notably, nuclear localization of P-tau was associated with p53 apoptotic stabilization and nucleolar stress, both of which resulted in neurodegeneration. In summary, our findings indicate that P-tau nuclear translocation results in p53-dependent apoptosis and nucleolar dispersion, which is consistent with neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Flavonoids slow down the death of photoreceptors in retinitis pigmentosa caused by the P23H rhodopsin mutation by stabilizing the structural conformation of the receptor mutant and decreasing the cellular stress response.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The balanced homeostasis of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), rhodopsin (Rho), is required for vision. Misfolding mutations in Rho cause photoreceptor death, leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and consequently blindness. With no cure currently available, the development of efficient therapy for RP is an urgent need. Pharmacological supplementation with molecular chaperones, including flavonoids, improves stability, folding, and membrane targeting of the RP Rho mutants in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that flavonoids by binding to P23H Rho and enhancing its conformational stability could mitigate detrimental effects of this mutation on retinal health. In this work, we evaluated the pharmacological potential of two model flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, by using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models of P23H Rho. Our computational analysis showed that quercetin could interact within the orthosteric binding pocket of P23H Rho and shift the conformation of its N-terminal loop toward the wild type (WT)-like state. Quercetin added to the NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing P23H Rho increased the stability of this receptor and improved its function. Systemic administration of quercetin to P23H Rho knock-in mice substantially improved retinal morphology and function, which was associated with an increase in levels of Rho and cone opsins. In addition, treatment with quercetin resulted in downregulation of the UPR signaling and oxidative stress-related markers. This study unravels the pharmacological potential of quercetin to slow down the progression of photoreceptor death in Rho-related RP and highlights its prospective as a lead compound to develop a novel therapeutic remedy to counter RP pathology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fear-related disorders, mainly phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, are highly prevalent, debilitating disorders that pose a significant public health problem. They are characterized by aberrant processing of aversive experiences and dysregulated fear extinction, leading to excessive expression of fear and diminished quality of life. The gold standard for treating fear-related disorders is extinction-based exposure therapy (ET), shown to be ineffective for up to 35% of subjects. Moreover, ET combined with traditional pharmacological treatments for fear-related disorders, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, offers no further advantage to patients. This prompted the search for ways to improve ET outcomes, with current research focused on pharmacological agents that can augment ET by strengthening fear extinction learning. Hallucinogenic drugs promote reprocessing of fear-imbued memories and induce positive mood and openness, relieving anxiety and enabling the necessary emotional engagement during psychotherapeutic interventions. Mechanistically, hallucinogens induce dynamic structural and functional neuroplastic changes across the fear extinction circuitry and temper amygdala's hyperreactivity to threat-related stimuli, effectively mitigating one of the hallmarks of fear-related disorders. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of hallucinogens' potential to alleviate symptoms of fear-related disorders by focusing on their effects on fear extinction and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We overview both preclinical and clinical studies and emphasize the advantages of hallucinogenic drugs over current first-line treatments. We highlight 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and ketamine as the most effective therapeutics for fear-related disorders and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for their potency with implications for improving hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, and the prevalence and societal impact continues to worsen annually. Multiple cognitive and emotional factors are known to modulate pain, including pain catastrophizing, which contributes to pain facilitation and is associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity in pain-related cortical and subcortical circuitry. Pain and catastrophizing levels are reported to be higher in non-Hispanic black (NHB) compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. The current study, a substudy of a larger ongoing observational cohort investigation, investigated the pathways by which ethnicity/race influences the relationship between pain catastrophizing, clinical pain, and resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Participants included 136 (66 NHBs and 70 NHWs) community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis. Participants completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Revised Pain Catastrophizing subscale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained, and resting-state functional connectivity was analyzed. Relative to NHW, the NHB participants were younger, reported lower income, were less likely to be married, and self-reported greater clinical pain and pain catastrophizing (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05). Ethnicity/race moderated the mediation effects of catastrophizing on the relationship between clinical pain and resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC, dlPFC, insula, and S1. These results indicate the NHB and NHW groups demonstrated different relationships between pain, catastrophizing, and functional connectivity. These results provide evidence for a potentially important role of ethnicity/race in the interrelationships among pain, catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity.</p>

     alt="Lateral entorhinal cortex lesions impair odor-context associative memory in male rats"/>
<p>Rats with lesions of lateral entorhinal cortex have impaired memory for associations of odors and contexts while their memory for individual items is unaffected. This suggests that integration of associative information occurs at the level of lateral entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) has been hypothesized to process nonspatial, item information that is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memories within the hippocampus. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that LEC has a role in integrating features of episodic memory prior to the hippocampus. While the precise role of LEC is still unclear, anatomical studies show that LEC is ideally placed to be a hub integrating multisensory information. The current study tests whether the role of LEC in integrating information extends to long-term multimodal item-context associations. In Experiment 1, male rats were trained on a context-dependent odor discrimination task, where two different contexts served as the cue to the correct odor. Rats were pretrained on the task and then received either bilateral excitotoxic LEC or sham lesions. Following surgery, rats were tested on the previously learned odor-context associations. Control rats showed good memory for the previously learned association but rats with LEC lesions showed significantly impaired performance relative to both their own presurgery performance and to control rats. Experiment 2 went on to test whether impairments in Experiment 1 were the result of LEC lesions impairing either odor or context memory retention alone. Male rats were trained on simple odor and context discrimination tasks that did not require integration of features to solve. Following surgery, both LEC and control rats showed good memory for previously learned odors and contexts. These data show that LEC is critical for long-term odor-context associative memory.</p>

<p>Very low (≤0.5 Gy) radiation doses twice per week (ultra-hyper fractionated radiotherapy) started soon after the last standard 2.0 Gy radiotherapeutic fraction may help to control high-grade glioma progression (image credits: University of Utah).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ionizing radiation is a mainstay of high-grade glioma therapy. The current standard radiotherapeutic schedule involves a total 60 Gy split in 2.0 Gy fractions delivered on weekdays for six weeks. Thereafter, almost invariably the tumor relapses and progresses. <i>In vitro</i> studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation towards high-grade glioma cells is greatly increased by splitting the total dose in fractions ten times smaller [0.1–0.5 Gy instead of standard 2.0 Gy—ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy (ultra-hyper-FRT)]. Recently, it became possible to consistently translate this therapeutic effect to the animal setting, by using glioma-initiating cell-driven faithful animal modeling. A re-analysis of the literature reporting radiotherapeutic clinical trials also suggests that the lower the average fraction size, the higher is the achievable overall survival of patients. However, average fraction sizes ≤ 0.5 Gy have never been thoroughly investigated in the clinics. We propose to study in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional radiation component of the current guidelines (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

     alt="Neural alterations in working memory of mild-moderate TBI: An fMRI study in Malaysia"/>
<p>The conventional letter n-back task elicited stronger activation in the mild–moderate TBI participants than the guided letter n-back. In TBI, there was a right dominance for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. Meanwhile, the load-dependent processing of WM was localized to the left middle frontal gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: <i>n</i> = 26 and TBI: <i>n</i> = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample.</p>

<p>Satellite microglia associate with different neuron types in the adult murine CNS. Their frequency correlates with the neuron density in a given brain region whereas a preference for neurons of a specific transmitter subtype is not apparent.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In the adult uncompromised CNS, they have a highly ramified morphology and continuously extend and retract their processes. A subpopulation of microglial cells forms close soma-to-soma contacts with neurons and have been termed satellite microglia, yet the role of such interaction is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the distribution of satellite microglia in different areas of the CNS of adult male mice applying transgenic- and immunolabeling of neuronal subtypes and microglia followed by three-dimensional imaging analysis. We quantified satellite microglia associated with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the somatosensory cortex, striatum, and thalamus; with dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the basal forebrain and raphe nucleus, respectively; and with cerebellar Purkinje cell neurons. Satellite microglia in the retina were assessed qualitatively. Microglia form satellites with all neuronal subtypes studied, whereas a preference for a specific neuron subtype was not found. The occurrence and frequency of satellite microglia is determined by the histo-architectural organization of the brain area and the densities of neuronal somata therein.</p>

     alt="Digital reconstruction and quantitative morphometric analysis of bipolar cells in live rat retinal slices"/>
<p>The tenet that structure is inextricably linked to function has inspired the characterization of complete morphologies of neurons since the time of Cajal. We have morphologically reconstructed and analyzed bipolar cells imaged with 2-photon microscopy in the rat retina. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating morphological and physiological properties.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bipolar cells convey signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. In mammals, there are typically 10–15 types of cone bipolar cells and one type of rod bipolar cell. Different types of cone bipolar cells are thought to code and transmit different features of a complex visual stimulus, thereby generating parallel channels that uniquely filter and transform the photoreceptor outputs. Differential synaptic connectivity and expression of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are thought to be important mechanisms for processing and filtering visual signals. Whereas the biophysical basis for such mechanisms has been investigated more extensively in rat retina, there is a lack of quantitative morphological data necessary for advancing the structure–function correlation in this species, as recent connectomics investigations have focused on mouse retina. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from cone and rod bipolar cells in rat retinal slices, filled the cells with fluorescent dyes, and acquired image stacks by multiphoton excitation microscopy. Following deconvolution, we performed digital reconstruction and morphometric analysis of 25 cone and 14 rod bipolar cells. Compared to previous descriptions, the extent and complexity of branching of the axon terminal was surprisingly high. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating physiological and morphological properties. The implemented workflow can be extended to the development of morphologically realistic compartmental models for these neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Coupling between DNA replication, segregation, and the onset of constriction in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Using high-throughput microscopy, Tiruvadi-Krishnan et al. determine timings for critical cell-cycle checkpoints related to division and replication in Escherichia coli. The data, combined with cell-cycle modeling, show that the onset of constriction is blocked by the mid-cell nucleoid. In slow-growth conditions, the blockage is limiting for cell division.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Btla signaling in conventional and regulatory lymphocytes coordinately tempers humoral immunity in the intestinal mucosa</a></h4>

              
                Stienne et al. investigate how BTLA and HVEM receptors control inflammatory and metabolic signaling in lymphocytes. A major function of these receptors in intestinal lymphoid tissue is to regulate mucosal antibody production. Ultimately, this system controls the composition of the intestinal microbiome, including pathogenic bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Restriction factor screening identifies RABGAP1L-mediated disruption of endocytosis as a host antiviral defense</a></h4>

              
                Interferons inhibit viruses through the concerted action of many host restriction factors. Here, Fernbach et al. use siRNA screening to identify interferon-dependent host factors that limit early stages of the influenza A virus replication cycle, leading to the characterization of RABGAP1L-mediated disruption of endocytosis as a broadly acting host antiviral mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Functional interactomes of the Ebola virus polymerase identified by proximity proteomics in the context of viral replication</a></h4>

              
                Using proximity proteomics coupled with siRNA screens, Fang et al. reveal functional interactomes of the Ebola virus polymerase, which drives synthesis of viral RNA. These functional hits illuminate a panel of host-dependent regulators of Ebola viral RNA synthesis, which could be potential targets for antiviral drug discovery and development.

                With single-cell transcriptomic analysis, Sun et al. show that inner ear vestibular and auditory ganglion neurons start expressing distinct genes at E11.5. The vestibular ganglion neurons have two subtypes, but auditory ones do not at E13.5. Shox2, Myt1, and Casz1 are shared by the vestibular and auditory ganglion neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strip1 regulates retinal ganglion cell survival by suppressing Jun-mediated apoptosis to promote retinal neural circuit formation</a></h4>

              
                In the vertebrate retina, an interplay between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine (AC), and bipolar (BP) cells establishes a synaptic layer called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). This circuit conveys signals from photoreceptors to visual centers in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its development remain poorly understood. Striatin-interacting protein 1 (Strip1) is a core component of the striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex, and it has shown emerging roles in embryonic morphogenesis. Here, we uncover the importance of Strip1 in inner retina development. Using zebrafish, we show that loss of Strip1 causes defects in IPL formation. In <i>strip1</i> mutants, RGCs undergo dramatic cell death shortly after birth. AC and BP cells subsequently invade the degenerating RGC layer, leading to a disorganized IPL. Mechanistically, zebrafish Strip1 interacts with its STRIPAK partner, Striatin 3 (Strn3), and both show overlapping functions in RGC survival. Furthermore, loss of Strip1 or Strn3 leads to activation of the proapoptotic marker, Jun, within RGCs, and Jun knockdown rescues RGC survival in <i>strip1</i> mutants. In addition to its function in RGC maintenance, Strip1 is required for RGC dendritic patterning, which likely contributes to proper IPL formation. Taken together, we propose that a series of Strip1-mediated regulatory events coordinates inner retinal circuit formation by maintaining RGCs during development, which ensures proper positioning and neurite patterning of inner retinal neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel immunopeptidomic-based pipeline for the generation of                    personalized oncolytic cancer vaccines</a></h4>

              
                Beside the isolation and identification of MHC-I restricted peptides from the                    surface of cancer cells, one of the challenges is eliciting an effective                    anti-tumor CD8+ T cell mediated response as part of therapeutic cancer vaccine.                    Therefore, the establishment of a solid pipeline for the downstream selection of                    clinically relevant peptides and the subsequent creation of therapeutic cancer                    vaccines are of utmost importance. Indeed, the use of peptides for eliciting                    specific anti-tumor adaptive immunity is hindered by two main limitations: the                    efficient selection of the most optimal candidate peptides and the use of a                    highly immunogenic platform to combine with the peptides to induce effective                    tumor-specific adaptive immune responses. Here, we describe for the first time a                    streamlined pipeline for the generation of personalized cancer vaccines starting                    from the isolation and selection of the most immunogenic peptide candidates                    expressed on the tumor cells and ending in the generation of efficient                    therapeutic oncolytic cancer vaccines. This immunopeptidomics-based pipeline was                    carefully validated in a murine colon tumor model CT26. Specifically, we used                    state-of-the-art immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric methodologies to                    isolate &gt;8000 peptide targets from the CT26 tumor cell line. The selection of                    the target candidates was then based on two separate approaches: RNAseq analysis                    and the HEX software. The latter is a tool previously developed by Chiaro et al.                    (1), able to identify tumor antigens similar to pathogen antigens, in order to                    exploit molecular mimicry and tumor pathogen cross-reactive T-cells in cancer                    vaccine development. The generated list of candidates (twenty-six in total) was                    further tested in a functional characterization assay using interferon-g ELISpot                    (Enzyme-Linked Immunospot), reducing the number of candidates to six. These                    peptides were then tested in our previously described oncolytic cancer vaccine                    platform PeptiCRAd, a vaccine platform that combines an immunogenic oncolytic                    adenovirus (OAd) coated with tumor antigen peptides. In our work, PeptiCRAd was                    successfully used for the treatment of mice bearing CT26, controlling the                    primary malignant lesion and most importantly a secondary, non-treated, cancer                    lesion. These results confirmed the feasibility of applying the described                    pipeline for the selection of peptide candidates and generation of therapeutic                    oncolytic cancer vaccine, filling a gap in the field of cancer immunotherapy,                    and paving the way to translate our pipeline into human therapeutic                    approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combining genotypes and T cell receptor distributions to infer genetic loci determining V(D)J recombination probabilities</a></h4>

              
                Every T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is shaped by a complex probabilistic tangle of genetically determined biases and immune exposures. T cells combine a random V(D)J recombination process with a selection process to generate highly diverse and functional TCRs. The extent to which an individual’s genetic background is associated with their resulting TCR repertoire diversity has yet to be fully explored. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset paired with high-resolution genome-wide genotyping from a large human cohort, we infer specific genetic loci associated with V(D)J recombination probabilities using genome-wide association inference. We show that V(D)J gene usage profiles are associated with variation in the <i>TCRB</i> locus and, specifically for the functional TCR repertoire, variation in the major histocompatibility complex locus. Further, we identify specific variations in the genes encoding the Artemis protein and the TdT protein to be associated with biasing junctional nucleotide deletion and N-insertion, respectively. These results refine our understanding of genetically-determined TCR repertoire biases by confirming and extending previous studies on the genetic determinants of V(D)J gene usage and providing the first examples of <i>trans</i> genetic variants which are associated with modifying junctional diversity. Together, these insights lay the groundwork for further explorations into how immune responses vary between individuals.
