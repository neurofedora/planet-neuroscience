                Background Research comparing inclusive education implementation in non-Western contexts, such as Indonesia and Oman, remains limited. Both countries share cultural similarities yet differ significantly in their education governance. Understanding these differences is crucial for improving inclusive education policies and practices. Methods This study employed qualitative document analysis, reviewing 33 policy and implementation documents from Indonesia and Oman. The analysis focused on five dimensions: service models, teacher training, curriculum adaptation, community involvement, and cultural attitudes. Results and Conclusions Findings reveal that Oman’s centralized system provides consistent policy coordination but limits community participation and school flexibility. Indonesia’s decentralized system allows greater local innovation and community involvement but leads to disparities in implementation quality. Both countries struggle with teacher training, curriculum adaptation, and cultural stigma against disabilities. Effective inclusive education requires a balanced approach combining adaptive centralization and equitable decentralization, ongoing teacher development, flexible curricula, active community engagement, and cultural transformation. These insights offer practical recommendations to strengthen inclusive education in diverse socio-political contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1360/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education and Assessment: The next step in the IT Revolution [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The digital revolution is transforming the face of medical education as Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become major factors in driving innovation. The use of digital platforms and immersive simulation systems trained with AI have been on the rise making learning more accessible, efficient and personalized. This review presents the current literature on the integration of IT/AI and medical education based on reviews, empirical investigations, and the opinions of the experts. Key areas of focus are e-learning and blended learning platforms, virtual and augmented reality simulations, intelligent tutoring systems, AI-based curriculum development, and AI-based assessment generation and grading. Evidence shows that these tools increase knowledge retention, encourage clinical reasoning, and provide safe environments for skills acquisition. The use of AI applications such as adaptive learning and automated testing helps to develop individualized learning which can be customized to the needs of individual learners. Using deep learning models to synthesize realistic virtual patients can foster communication skills and streamline feedback. Challenges for the widespread adoption of AI applications exist such as high implementation costs, faculty preparedness, data privacy, learner misuse, algorithm biases and unequal access. At the same time, there is growing appreciation for the importance of curriculum changes that incorporate AI literacy and digital skills in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical training. Future directions are also highlighted, such as teaching AI literacy as part of medical curricula, using AI-driven mixed reality simulations, developing an interdisciplinary collaboration to support responsible AI adoption, and developing standards to support the seamless integration between IT and AI systems. By providing a synthesis of evidence around currently available technologies, this review offers an understanding of the nature and impact of IT/AI on medical education, which may guide those preparing the next generation of healthcare professionals for an increasingly digital clinical world.

                arXiv:2512.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication is central to achieving positive healthcare outcomes in mental health contexts, yet international students often face linguistic and cultural barriers that hinder their communication of mental distress. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication.

                arXiv:2512.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythmic fluctuations in acoustic energy and accompanying neuronal excitations in cortical oscillations are characteristic of human speech, yet whether a corresponding rhythmicity inheres in the articulatory movements that generate speech remains unclear. The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04808">Setting up for failure: automatic discovery of the neural mechanisms of cognitive errors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04989">Influence of Object Affordance on Action Language Understanding: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal neural dynamics by which affordance representations influence action language comprehension. In this study, 18 participants observed stimuli displayed in two conditions during the experiment: text-only (e.g., `Hit with a hammer') and video+text (visual clips with matching phrases). EEG data were recorded from 32 channels and analyzed for event-related potentials and source localization using LORETA, which identified four left-hemisphere regions of interest: the Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC), Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (pSTG), Ventral Premotor Cortex (PMv), and Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL). A space of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was constructed with driving inputs to LOC and pSTG, and multiple connectivity configurations were tested. Bayesian Model Selection revealed a dominant model in which PMv causally influenced IPL and pSTG, reflecting a feedforward architecture from affordance-related motor regions to semantic hubs. Bayesian Model Averaging further confirmed strong endogenous connections from LOC to PMv and IPL, and significant modulation from PMv to IPL. These findings provide direct evidence that affordance processing in premotor regions drives action language understanding by engaging downstream parietal and temporal areas. The results support grounded cognition theories and offer a mechanistic account of how sensorimotor information contributes to linguistic comprehension.

                arXiv:2512.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large-scale neural recordings have expanded our ability to describe the activity of distributed brain circuits. However, understanding how neural population dynamics differ across regions and behavioral contexts remains challenging. Here, we surveyed neuronal population dynamics across multiple mouse brain areas (visual cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain) using spike data from local ensembles. Two complementary measures were used to characterize these dynamics: the coefficient of variation (CV), a classical indicator of spike-time variability, and statistical complexity, an information-theoretic quantifier of organizational structure. To probe stimulus-dependent activity, we segmented and concatenated recordings from behavioral experiments into distinct time series corresponding to natural image presentations, blank screens during visual task, and spontaneous activity. While the CV failed to discriminate between these conditions, statistical complexity revealed clear, stimulus-specific motifs in population activity. These results indicate that information-theoretic measures can uncover structured, stimulus-dependent patterns in neural population dynamics that remain unobserved in traditional variability metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04241">Covering Relations in the Poset of Combinatorial Neural Codes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combinatorial neural code is a subset of the power set $2^{[n]}$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots, n\}$, in which each $1\leq i\leq n$ represents a neuron and each element (codeword) represents the co-firing event of some neurons. Consider a space $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, simulating an animal's environment, and a collection $\mathcal{U}=\{U_1,\dots,U_n\}$ of open subsets of $X$. Each $U_i\subseteq X$ simulates a place field which is a specific region where a place cell $i$ is active. Then, the code of $\mathcal{U}$ in $X$ is defined as $\text{code}(\mathcal{U},X)=\left\{\sigma\subseteq[n]\bigg|\bigcap_{i\in\sigma} U_i\setminus\bigcup_{j\notin\sigma}U_j\neq\varnothing\right\}$. If a neural code $\mathcal{C}=\text{code}(\mathcal{U},X)$ for some $X$ and $\mathcal{U}$, we say $\mathcal{C}$ has a realization of open subsets of some space $X$. Although every combinatorial neural code obviously has a realization by some open subsets, determining whether it has a realization by some open convex subsets remains unsolved. Many studies attempted to tackle this decision problem, but only partial results were achieved. In fact, a previous study showed that the decision problem of convex neural codes is NP-hard. Furthermore, the authors of this study conjectured that every convex neural code can be realized as a minor of a neural code arising from a representable oriented matroid, which can lead to an equivalence between convex and polytope convex neural codes. Even though this conjecture has been confirmed in dimension two, its validity in higher dimensions is still unknown. To advance the investigation of this conjecture, we provide a complete characterization of the covering relations within the poset $\mathbf{P_{Code}}$ of neural codes.

                arXiv:2512.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00008">The Copernican Argument for Alien Consciousness; The Mimicry Argument Against Robot Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On broadly Copernican grounds, we are entitled to assume that apparently behaviorally sophisticated extraterrestrial entities ("aliens") would be conscious. Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly lucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated entities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this Copernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally sophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with consciousness ("consciousness mimics"), and in particular a broad class of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations, which we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments, jointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according to which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to aliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent they perform similarly. Our approach is unusual in the following respect: Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot consciousness in a particular metaphysical or scientific theory about the physical or functional bases of consciousness, we appeal directly to the epistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best explanation.

                arXiv:2508.16667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global population is aging rapidly, and aging is a major risk factor for various diseases. It is an important task to predict how each individual's brain will age, as the brain supports many human functions. This capability can greatly facilitate healthcare automation by enabling personalized, proactive intervention and efficient healthcare resource allocation. However, this task is extremely challenging because of the brain's complex 3D anatomy. While there have been successes in natural image generation and brain MRI synthesis, existing methods fall short in generating individualized, anatomically faithful aging brain trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPath, a novel AI model that, given a single structural MRI of an individual, generates synthetic longitudinal MRIs that represent that individual's expected brain anatomy as they age. BrainPath introduces three architectural innovations: an age-aware encoder with biologically grounded supervision, a differential age conditioned decoder for anatomically faithful MRI synthesis, and a swap-learning strategy that implicitly separates stable subject-specific anatomy from aging effects. We further design biologically informed loss functions, including an age calibration loss and an age and structural perceptual loss, to complement the conventional reconstruction loss. This enables the model to capture subtle, temporally meaningful anatomical changes associated with aging. We apply BrainPath to two of the largest public aging datasets and conduct a comprehensive, multifaceted evaluation. Our results demonstrate BrainPath's superior performance in generation accuracy, anatomical fidelity, and cross-dataset generalizability, outperforming competing methods.

Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.

                arXiv:2511.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

                arXiv:2512.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dendrite-inspired neurons have been widely used in tasks such as image classification due to low computational complexity and fast inference speed. Temporal data prediction, as a key machine learning task, plays a key role in real-time scenarios such as sensor data analysis, financial forecasting, and urban traffic management. However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings. Compared with traditional neurons without dendritic functions, Memory-DD requires only two neuron groups to extract logical relationships between features in input sequences. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%. These results demonstrate that Memory-DD successfully extends the low-complexity advantages of dendrite-inspired neurons to temporal prediction, providing a low-complexity and efficient solution for time-series data processing.

                arXiv:2512.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across research domains to tackle complex tasks, but their performance can vary significantly depending on the task at hand. Evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can be used to refine solutions iteratively at inference-time. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been exploration on leveraging the collective capabilities of multi-source seeding for LLM-guided genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, MultiGA, which applies genetic algorithm principles to address complex natural language tasks and reasoning problems by sampling from a diverse population of LLMs to initialize the population. MultiGA generates a range of outputs from various parent LLMs, open source and closed source, and uses a neutral fitness function to evaluate them. Through an iterative recombination process, we mix and refine these generations until an optimal solution is achieved. We benchmark our approach using text-to-SQL code generation tasks, trip planning, GPQA benchmark for grad-level science questions, and the BBQ bias benchmark. Our results show that MultiGA converges to the accuracy of the LLM best fit for the task, and these insights lay the foundation for future research looking closer at integrating multiple LLMs for unexplored tasks in which selecting only one pre-trained model is unclear or suboptimal.

Abstract: Designing Zero-Emissions Buildings (ZEBs) involves balancing numerous complex objectives that traditional methods struggle to address. Fenestration, encompassing fa\c{c}ade openings and shading systems, plays a critical role in ZEB performance due to its high thermal transmittance and solar radiation admission. This paper presents a novel simulation-based optimization method for fenestration designed for practical application. It uses a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm and relies on rules and an updatable catalog, to fully automate the design process, create a highly diverse search space, minimize biases, and generate detailed solutions ready for architectural prescription. Nineteen fenestration variables, over which architects have design flexibility, were optimized to reduce heating, cooling demand, and thermal discomfort in residential buildings. The method was tested across three Spanish climate zones. Results demonstrate that the considered optimization algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline Genetic Algorithm in both quality and robustness, with these differences proven to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the findings offer valuable insights for ZEB design, highlighting challenges in reducing cooling demand in warm climates, and showcasing the superior efficiency of automated movable shading systems compared to fixed solutions.

                arXiv:2512.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks, thanks to their sparse binary activation. However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.

                arXiv:2512.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) in expressive search spaces is a computationally hard problem, but it also holds the potential to automatically discover completely novel and performant architectures. To achieve this we need effective search algorithms that can identify powerful components and reuse them in new candidate architectures. In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS.

                arXiv:2512.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event driven computation, sparse activation, and hardware efficiency, yet training often converges slowly and lacks stability. We present Adaptive Homeostatic Spiking Activity Regulation (AHSAR), an extremely simple plug in and training paradigm agnostic method that stabilizes optimization and accelerates convergence without changing the model architecture, loss, or gradients. AHSAR introduces no trainable parameters. It maintains a per layer homeostatic state during the forward pass, maps centered firing rate deviations to threshold scales through a bounded nonlinearity, uses lightweight cross layer diffusion to avoid sharp imbalance, and applies a slow across epoch global gain that combines validation progress with activity energy to tune the operating point. The computational cost is negligible. Across diverse training methods, SNN architectures of different depths, widths, and temporal steps, and both RGB and DVS datasets, AHSAR consistently improves strong baselines and enhances out of distribution robustness. These results indicate that keeping layer activity within a moderate band is a simple and effective principle for scalable and efficient SNN training.

                arXiv:2512.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.

                arXiv:2512.04475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to ensuring functional stability of neural networks through hardware redundancy at the individual neuron level. Unlike the classical Dropout method, which is used during training for regularization purposes, the proposed system ensures resilience to hardware failures during network operation. Each neuron is implemented on a separate microcomputer (ESP32), allowing the system to continue functioning even when individual computational nodes fail.

                arXiv:2407.13535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation is believed to be controlled by at least two partially dissociable systems in the brain. The cognitive map informs an organism of its location and bearing, updated by integrating vestibular self-motion or predicting distances to landmarks. Route-based navigation, on the other hand, directly evaluate sequential movement decisions from immediate percepts. Here we demonstrate the sufficiency of visual route-based decision-making in a classic open field navigation task often assumed to require a cognitive map. Three distinct strategies emerge to robustly navigate to a hidden goal, each conferring contextual tradeoffs analyzed at both neural and behavioral scales, as well as qualitatively aligning with behavior observed across the biological spectrum. We propose reframing navigation from the bottom-up, through an egocentric episodic perspective without assuming online access to computationally expensive top-down representations, to better explain behavior under energetic or attentional constraints.

                arXiv:2407.11698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a pivotal technique for managing the growing computational and memory demands of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit Floating-Point (FP) to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNNs. However, most existing methods typically target DNN inference, while training still relies on FP operations, limiting applicability in environments where FP arithmetic is unavailable. To date, only one prior work has addressed integer-only training, and only for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This paper introduces NITRO-D, a novel framework for training deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely in the integer domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D enables training of integer CNNs without requiring a separate quantization scheme. Specifically, it introduces a novel architecture that integrates multiple local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO-Scaling layer and NITRO-ReLU activation function. The proposed framework also features a novel learning algorithm that employs local error signals and leverages IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed for integer computations. NITRO-D is implemented as an open-source Python library. Extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art image recognition datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. For integer-only MLPs, NITRO-D improves test accuracy by up to +5.96% over the state-of-the-art. It also successfully trains integer-only CNNs, reducing memory requirements and energy consumption by up to 76.14% and 32.42%, respectively, compared to the traditional FP backpropagation algorithm.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the intersection of sparse coding theory and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish a thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature-learning tasks. We additionally extend this convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for the extraction of deep-sparse features. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn sparser features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insight for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.

Abstract: This note addresses the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART) and the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), focusing on their frequent misinterpretations found in the neural network literature. Our remarks aim to support a more accurate understanding of KART and UAT among neural network specialists. In addition, we explore the minimal number of neurons required for universal approximation, showing that the same number of neurons needed for exact representation of functions in KART-based networks also suffices for standard multilayer perceptrons in the context of approximation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01012">Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

                <p>by Mengxiang Lin, Rongqi Fan, Saisai Zhu, Xiaoqiang Yan, Quan Zou, Zhen Tian</p>

Cancer’s heterogeneity necessitates precise subtype identification for effective diagnosis and treatment, which can be achieved by integrating multi-omics data to reveal distinct molecular characteristics and enable personalized therapies. Recently, significant efforts have been made through contrastive clustering methods to efficiently identify cancer subtypes. However, existing approaches remain limited in effectively capturing inter- and intra-view relationships in multi-omics data. Additionally, most cancer subtyping methods often rely on random sampling to construct negative pairs, which may inadvertently engender false negatives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning model named Decoupled Contrastive Multi-view Clustering with adaptive false negative elimination (DCMC). Specifically, DCMC adopts a multi-view clustering architecture that facilitates intra- and inter-view contrastive learning across distinct embedding spaces, allowing view-specific information to be preserved while maintaining cross-view consistency. We further introduce an adaptive false negative elimination framework to progressively screen potential false negatives. Finally, pseudo-label rectification is applied to enhance the quality of the learned representations and further refine the clustering process. DCMC is evaluated on 10 commonly used cancer datasets against 19 state-of-the-art methods, with experimental results validating its superior performance. In the Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma case study, differential expression analysis is performed to identify potential biomarkers, while the cancer subtypes identified by DCMC are validated for their responses to specific therapeutic drugs. The datasets and source code for DCMC are available online at https://github.com/LinMengX/DCMC.

                <p>by Dylan J. Morris, Lauren Kennedy, Andrew J. Black</p>

Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus’ biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method for this class of models by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.

                <p>by Tianyu Xie, Yicong Mao, Cheng Zhang</p>

Probabilistic modeling over the combinatorially large space of tree topologies remains a central challenge in phylogenetic inference. Previous approaches often necessitate pre-sampled tree topologies, limiting their modeling capability to a subset of the entire tree space. A recent advancement is ARTree, a deep autoregressive model that offers unrestricted distributions for tree topologies. However, its reliance on repetitive tree traversals and inefficient local message passing for computing topological node representations may hamper the scalability to large datasets. This paper proposes ARTreeFormer, a novel approach that harnesses fixed-point iteration and attention mechanisms to accelerate ARTree. By introducing a fixed-point iteration algorithm for computing the topological node embeddings, ARTreeFormer allows fast vectorized computation, especially on CUDA devices. This, together with an attention-based global message passing scheme, significantly improves the computation speed of ARTree while maintaining great approximation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on a benchmark of challenging real data phylogenetic inference problems.

To address this issue, we investigate the role of antibiotic-mediated interactions in driving microbial diversity using methods from graph theory and theoretical ecology. Our exhaustive analysis of small interaction graphs involving antibiotic production, resistance, and degradation reveals that two factors together determine whether an interaction pattern can support coexistence or not: a certain producer-sensitive-degrader (PSD) motif is critical, and a form of cyclicity between the action of different antibiotics is necessary. Using individual-based simulations, we also explore the role of the PSD motif in spatially structured populations and demonstrate that community coexistence is robust over a wide range of antibiotic and degrader diffusivities. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the interaction patterns that drive diversity in complex microbial communities. Specifically, we emphasize how antagonism does not preclude biodiversity. These results offer clear pathways for cultivating synthetic microbial consortia, enabling the design of more effective strategies for manipulating microbial communities.

Microbes of nearly every species can form biofilms, communities of cells bound together by a self-produced matrix. It is not understood how variation at the cellular level impacts putatively beneficial, colony-level behaviors, such as cell-to-cell signaling. Here we investigate this problem with an agent-based computational model of metabolically driven electrochemical signaling in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilms. In this process, glutamate-starved interior cells release potassium, triggering a depolarizing wave that spreads to exterior cells and limits their glutamate uptake. More nutrients diffuse to the interior, temporarily reducing glutamate stress and leading to oscillations. In our model, each cell has a membrane potential coupled to metabolism. As a simulated biofilm grows, collective membrane potential oscillations arise spontaneously as cells deplete nutrients and trigger potassium release, reproducing experimental observations. We further validate our model by comparing spatial signaling patterns and cellular signaling rates with those observed experimentally. By oscillating external glutamate and potassium, we find that biofilms synchronize to external potassium, providing a potential mechanism for previously observed oscillation synchronization. By tracking cellular glutamate concentrations, we find that oscillations evenly distribute nutrients in space: non-oscillating biofilms have an external layer of well-fed cells surrounding a starved core, whereas oscillating biofilms exhibit a relatively uniform distribution of glutamate. Our work shows the potential of agent-based models to connect cellular properties to collective phenomena and facilitates studies of how inheritance of cellular traits can affect the evolution of group behaviors.

The BioModels Repository contains over 1000 manually curated mechanistic models from published literature, most often encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). This community-based standard formally specifies each model, but does not describe the computational experimental conditions to run a simulation and collect data. Therefore, it can be challenging to reproduce any figure or result from a publication with an SBML model alone. The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) provides a solution: a standard way to specify exactly how to run an experiment corresponding to a specific figure or result. BioModels was established years before SED-ML, and both systems evolved over time, both in content and acceptance. Hence, only about half of the entries in BioModels contained SED-ML files, and these files reflected the version of SED-ML that was available at the time. Additionally, almost all of these SED-ML files had at least one minor mistake that made them impossible to run. To make these models and their results more reproducible, we report here on our work updating, correcting and generating new SED-ML files for 1055 curated mechanistic models in BioModels. In addition, because SED-ML is implementation-independent, it can be used for <i>verification</i>, demonstrating that results hold across multiple simulation engines. We tested, corrected, and improved over 450 existing SED-ML files in the BioModels database, and created basic files for the rest of the entries. Then, we used a wrapper architecture for interpreting SED-ML, and report verification results across five different ODE-based biosimulation engines, after further improving the models, the wrappers, and the engines themselves. Our work with SED-ML and the BioModels collection aims to improve the utility of these models by making them more reproducible and credible. Improved reproducibility means these models are now even more fit for re-use, such as in new investigations and as components of multiscale models.

                <p>by Aditya Kamat, Asha Mary Joseph, Deeksha Rathour, Anjana Badrinarayanan</p>

Bacteria encode for gene regulatory networks crucial for sensing and repairing DNA damage. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, these transcriptional networks are induced in a temporally structured manner. A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response that is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA box properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. We observe that LexA box properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as one of the factors modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses.

                <p>by Yizhun Zeng, Xiaopeng Song, Qi Chen, Yue Gu, Jie Zhang, Tao Zhou, Zhihao Li, Tao Wang, Le Chang, Hongwei Yao, Yan Wang, Liyan Miao, Liujia Qian, Tiannan Guo, Yong Zhang, Sonia Rodriguez-Fernandez, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Ying Xu</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, orchestrates daily metabolic rhythms, yet its role in substrate selection and thermogenic adaptation under stress remains insufficiently understood. Here, we show that SCN lesioning abolishes the adaptive suppression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis typically observed during time-restricted feeding in subthermoneutral environments (TRF-STE), a paradigm that imposes concurrent nutrient and thermal stress. Contrary to wild-type responses, SCN-lesioned mice maintain elevated BAT thermogenic activity, despite impaired lipolysis, instead shifting toward glucose-driven heat production. This phenotype is accompanied by sustained sympathetic tone and β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) signaling in BAT. Mechanistically, we identify a SCN-regulated ADRB3-S100B signaling axis underlying this metabolic reprogramming. S100B, a nutrient-sensitive calcium-binding protein, is upregulated in BAT following SCN disruption, where it promotes thermogenesis by stimulating brown adipocyte proliferation and suppressing senescence. Functional studies reveal that S100B is both necessary and sufficient for sustaining BAT thermogenesis under TRF-STE. Furthermore, diverse SCN disruption models, including light-induced circadian arrhythmia, N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) excitotoxicity, and Caspase-3-mediated ablation, consistently elevate S100B expression in BAT, reinforcing its role as a convergent effector of SCN-regulated metabolic adaptation. Thus, in intact animal, the SCN restrains the ADRB3-S100B module, gating BAT thermogenic output in accordance with energetic availability. Disruption of SCN output lifts this restraint, unmasking a latent ADRB3-S100B program that preserves thermogenesis when lipid fuel is limited. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the SCN in governing thermogenic flexibility and fuel partitioning, and position the ADRB3-S100B axis as a potential target for mitigating circadian misalignment and metabolic disease.

                <p>by Wei Qi Guinevere Sew, Maria Molano-Fernández, Zhiquan Li, Artim Lange, Nahia Pérez de Ciriza, Lene Juel Rasmussen, Hector Herranz</p>

Mitochondrial function and dynamics are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and overall health. Disruptions in these processes can contribute to various diseases, including cancer. The Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of tissue growth, plays a central role in cancer through its main effector, the Yes-associated protein (YAP), known as Yorkie (Yki) in <i>Drosophila</i>. In this model organism, <i>Yki</i> upregulation drives benign tissue overgrowth in imaginal discs. Our research demonstrates that the conserved metabolic regulator dPGC1 restricts Yki-driven tissue hyperplasia and helps maintain epithelial integrity in vivo. Combined <i>Yki</i> upregulation and <i>dPGC1</i> depletion results in tumors characterized by enlarged mitochondria and the upregulation of genes promoting mitochondrial fusion, a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for Yki-driven oncogenic growth. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial enlargement is associated with increased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin E, which plays a critical role in tumor development. These findings identify dPGC1 as a context-dependent tumor suppressor that coordinates mitochondrial dynamics and cell cycle regulation in response to oncogene activation, with implications for understanding cancer development in humans.

                The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in project management is transforming decision-making processes, enhancing task execution, and improving risk management. This study aimed to elucidate the challenges raised by AI in project management (PM) using a scientometric and qualitative analysis. The research employs both quantitative and qualitative analysis using VOSviewer. The scientometric analyses reveal a substantial increase in AI in PM publications, with “project management,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “cost reduction,” “decision making” and “supply chain management” as the most influential co-occurrence. The systematic review the implementation of challenges and strategies. The analysis identifies the publication trends, most significant keywords, leading institutions and researchers, prominent collaboration connections, primary publication venues, and the most-cited publications. This research enhances understanding of AI in PM, promotes the utilization of artificial intelligence technologies for gaining insights during certain phases of project development, and improves project management efficiency. The utilization of AI technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, markedly improves project efficiency by enhancing decision-making, effectiveness, and risk mitigation.

                Introduction Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. Case Presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Conclusion Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes.

                Background Manufacturing inefficiencies result in substantial financial losses for global industries. The present study introduces a robust Performance Measurement System (PMS) incorporating Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) to address efficiency challenges in multi-stage manufacturing systems. Methods The study employs a case study approach within the pharmaceutical industry to reveal the pragmatic application of NDEA, which serves as the primary analytical instrument for evaluating performance across diverse production stages. Focusing on the production processes of intravenous (IV) sets, the research aims to highlight how NDEA disaggregates interconnected processes and quantify efficiency measures to pinpoint sources of inefficiencies in particular production stages and actionable insights for operational improvement. The analysis also explores the trade-off between model complexity and discrimination power as the number of stages increases. Results First, the NDEA-based PMS provides insights to address specific process inefficiencies on the shop floor, providing strategic insights for process improvement. Second, despite its power in pinpointing the source of inefficiency, modelling a process-based PMS faces a challenge as increasing the number of stages in the model presents a trade-off between the accuracy and discrimination power of the NDEA model. Conclusions This study holds significance within the broader field of performance measurement and efficiency analysis by bridging theoretical modelling and practical implementation. It advances existing knowledge through the integration of NDEA into a process-based PMS, offering a novel analytical framework for multi-stage manufacturing systems. By examining the trade-off between model complexity and discrimination power, this research contributes new methodological insights and extends the applicability of NDEA in real-world industrial settings. The framework offers managers actionable guidance for optimizing multi-stage manufacturing operations and contributes novel insights into the methodological behaviour of NDEA. Ultimately, this work strengthens the linkage between performance measurement theory and industrial practice, positioning NDEA as a valuable tool for continuous improvement in manufacturing systems.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                Zhou et al. identify DHCR24 acetylation at Lys254 as a key metabolic switch in hepatocellular carcinoma. This modification stabilizes DHCR24, enhances cholesterol synthesis, and promotes 7-ketocholesterol-p62 signaling to drive tumor growth. Pharmacologic inhibition of DHCR24 with irbesartan suppresses DHCR24 acetylation and tumor progression, revealing a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

                Liu et al. demonstrate that the MYB transcription factor SRM1 promotes plant growth by activating PORA expression and enhances plant disease resistance by triggering DFR and EDS1 expression. SRM1 coordinates growth defense through transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications.

                Luck et al. identify the bacterial protein ZmpB as a key factor in heart damage during severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Variants of ZmpB with FIVAR domains enable cardiac cell invasion, while immunization with ZmpB reduces damage. These findings advance our understanding of S. pneumoniae pathogenesis and open new possibilities for intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93554">Sub-surface deformation of individual fingerprint ridges during tactile interactions</a></h4>

              
                The human fingertip can detect small tactile features with a spatial acuity roughly the width of a fingerprint ridge. However, how individual ridges deform under contact to support accurate and high-precision tactile feedback is currently unknown. The complex mechanical structure of the glabrous skin, composed of multiple layers and intricate morphology within which mechanoreceptors are embedded, makes this question challenging. Here, we used optical coherence tomography to image and track sub-surface deformations of hundreds of individual fingerprint ridges across ten participants and four individual contact events at high spatial resolution in vivo. We calculated strain patterns in both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis in response to a variety of passively applied tactile stimuli, including static indentation, stick-to-slip events, sliding of a flat surface in different directions, and interaction with small tactile features, such as edges and grooves. We found that ridges could stretch, compress, and undergo considerable shearing orthogonal to the skin surface, but there was limited horizontal shear. Therefore, it appears that the primary components of ridge deformation and, potentially, neural responses are deformations of the ridge flanks and their relative movement, rather than overall bending of the ridges themselves. We conclude that the local distribution of mechanoreceptors across the ridges might be ideally suited to extract the resulting strain gradients and that the fingertip skin may possess a higher mechanical spatial resolution than that of a single ridge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108331">Ptbp1 is not required for retinal neurogenesis and cell fate specification</a></h4>

              
                The RNA-binding protein Ptbp1 has been proposed as a master regulator of neuronal fate, repressing neurogenesis through its effects on alternative splicing and miRNA maturation. While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following <i>Ptbp1</i> loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted <i>Ptbp1</i> in mouse retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and Müller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in <i>Ptbp1</i> mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of <i>Ptbp1</i> in mature glia. Our findings demonstrate that Ptbp1 is dispensable for retinal cell fate specification and suggest that its proposed role as a central repressor of neurogenesis should be reevaluated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104282">Timely vaccine strain selection and genomic surveillance improve evolutionary forecast accuracy of seasonal influenza A/H3N2</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary forecasting models inform seasonal influenza vaccine design by predicting which current genetic variants will dominate in the influenza season 12 months later. Forecasting models depend on hemagglutinin sequences from global public health networks to identify current genetic variants (clades) and estimate clade fitnesses. The lag between collection of a clinical sample and public availability of its sequence averages ∼3 months, complicating the 12-month forecasting problem by reducing our understanding of current clade frequencies. Despite continued methodological improvements to forecasting models, these constraints of a 12-month forecast horizon and 3-month submission lags impose an upper bound on any model’s accuracy. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed that modern vaccine technology reduces forecast horizons to 6 months and expanded sequencing support reduces submission lags to 1 month on average. We quantified the potential effects of these public health policy changes on forecast accuracy for A/H3N2 populations. Reducing forecast horizons to 6 months reduced average absolute forecasting errors to 25% of the 12-month average, while reducing submission lags decreased uncertainty in current clade frequencies by 50%. These results show the potential to improve the accuracy of existing forecasting models through realistic changes to public health policy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107733">Mechanism of SK2 channel gating and its modulation by the bee toxin apamin and small molecules</a></h4>

              
                Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 2 (SK2) serves a variety of biological functions by coupling intracellular calcium dynamics with membrane potential. SK2 modulators are in development for the treatment of neurological and cardiovascular diseases, though the mechanisms of pharmacological modulation remain incompletely understood. We determined structures of an SK2–4 chimeric channel in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conformations and in complex with the bee toxin apamin, a small molecule inhibitor, and a small molecule activator. The structures revealed that the S3–S4 linker forms a hydrophobic constriction at the extracellular opening of the pore. Apamin binds to this extracellular constriction and blocks the exit of potassium ions. Furthermore, we identified a structurally related SK2 inhibitor and activator that bind to the transmembrane domains. The compounds exert opposing effects on gating by differentially modulating the conformation of the S6 helices. These results provide important mechanistic insights to facilitate the development of targeted SK2 channel therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105526">Biophysical network modeling of temporal and stereotyped sequence propagation of neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC</a></h4>

              
                Stereotyped neural sequences are often exhibited in the brain, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Birdsong is a prominent model to study such behavior, particularly because juvenile songbirds progressively learn from their tutors and by adulthood are able to sing stereotyped song patterns. The songbird premotor nucleus HVC coordinates motor and auditory activity responsible for learned vocalizations. The HVC comprises three neural populations that have distinct in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological responses. Typically, models that explain HVC’s network either rely on intrinsic HVC circuitry to propagate sequential activity, rely on extrinsic feedback to advance the sequence, or rely on both. Here, we developed a physiologically realistic neural network model incorporating the three classes of HVC neurons based on the ion channels and the synaptic currents that had been pharmacologically identified. Our model is based on a feedforward chain of microcircuits that encode for the different sub-syllabic segments (SSSs) and that interact with each other through structured feedback inhibition. The network reproduced the in vivo activity patterns of each class of HVC neurons and unveiled key intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that govern the sequential propagation of neural activity by highlighting important roles for the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current, A-type K<sup>+</sup> current, hyperpolarization-activated inward current, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The result is a biophysically realistic model that suggests an improved characterization of the HVC network responsible for song production in the songbird.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104950">Crossover in aromatic amino acid interaction strength between tyrosine and phenylalanine in biomolecular condensates</a></h4>

              
                Biomolecular condensates often form through the self-assembly of disordered proteins with low-complexity sequences. In these polypeptides, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine act as key ‘sticker’ residues, driving the cohesion of dense phases. Recent studies on condensates suggest a hierarchy in sticker strength, with tyrosine being more adhesive than phenylalanine. This hierarchy aligns with experimental data on amino acids solubilities and potentials of mean force derived from atomistic simulations. However, it contradicts conventional chemical intuition based on hydrophobicity scales and pairwise contact statistics from experimental structures of proteins, which suggest that phenylalanine should be the stronger sticker. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Using simple model peptides and side-chain analogues, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed hierarchy arises from the lower free energy of transfer of tyrosine into the condensate, mediated by both stronger protein-protein interactions and solvation effects in the condensate environment. Notably, as the dielectric constant of the media surrounding the stickers approaches that of an apolar solvent, the trend reverses, and phenylalanine becomes the stronger sticker. These findings highlight the role of the chemical environment in modulating protein-protein interactions, providing a clear explanation for the crossover in sticker strength between tyrosine and phenylalanine in different media.

                Leukocyte extravasation across the blood endothelium to inflamed tissues is a crucial defence mechanism against invading pathogens. After the elimination of the pathogen in the tissue, inflammation needs to be resolved back to steady state. This cascade comprises at least three stages: transmigration through the endothelium and the underlying basement membrane, intra-tissue leukocyte activity, and tissue resolution. In each stage, extracellular matrix proteins in the vascular basement membrane and in tissues regulate a multitude of endothelial and leukocyte functions essential to completion of the cascade, either as a collective force-permissive structure or through signaling by individual matrix proteins. Proper orchestration of these diverse processes during the extravasation journey ensures effective defence and avoids development of chronic inflammatory diseases. This review will focus on how these extracellular matrices regulate the extravasation journey of leukocytes to illustrate their tight functional interdependence with profound impacts on the ultimate post-inflammation tissue fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94174">Coenzyme-protein interactions since early life</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings in protein evolution and peptide prebiotic plausibility have been setting the stage for reconsidering the role of peptides in the early stages of life’s origin. Ancient protein families have been found to share common themes and proteins reduced in composition to prebiotically plausible amino acids have been reported capable of structure formation and key functions, such as binding to RNA. While this may suggest peptide relevance in early life, their functional repertoire, when composed of a limited number of early residues (missing some of the most sophisticated functional groups of today’s alphabet) has been debated. Cofactors enrich the functional scope of about half of extant enzymes, but whether they could also bind to peptides lacking the evolutionary late amino acids remains speculative. The aim of this study was to resolve the early peptide propensity to bind organic cofactors by analysis of protein-coenzyme interactions across the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We find that the prebiotically plausible amino acids are more abundant in the binding sites of the most ancient coenzymes and that such interactions rely more frequently on the involvement of the protein backbone atoms and metal ion cofactors. Moreover, we have identified a few select examples in today’s enzymes where coenzyme binding is supported solely by prebiotically available amino acids. These results imply the plausibility of a coenzyme-peptide functional collaboration preceding the establishment of the Central Dogma and full protein alphabet evolution.

">Ventromedial striatal dopamine dynamically integrates motivated action and reward proximity</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine release in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) both invigorates actions and encodes reward-related information, yet how these functions are integrated remains under active debate. To investigate this further, we designed four different versions of a rat Go/No-go task, where we systematically manipulated response requirements, temporal task demands, and controllability of reward pursuit. Dopamine release increased reliably during action initiation (Go) but was delayed during action suppression (No-go), and was insensitive to augmented response demands or controllability. Following response completion, dopamine rose gradually until animals arrived at the reward location, irrespective of reward-delivery timing, prior action demands, or controllability. This proximity dopamine-signal was exaggerated after animals exhibited Pavlovian consummatory behavior during No-go trials, revealing a motivational signal component. Together, these findings indicate that in reward contexts, VMS-dopamine signals successively integrate the invigoration of action initiation with the continuous estimation of spatial - but not temporal - proximity to rewards.

">NVUAtlas: A Comprehensive Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Resource for the Human Neurovascular Unit in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction is being recognized as one of the earliest contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, systematic investigation of NVU dysfunction is currently limited by lack of access to molecular level information due to underrepresentation of vascular and mural cells in standard single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets. Consequently, existing transcriptomic atlases lack the resolution necessary to capture the coordinated intercellular signaling and dysfunction across vascular components of NVU, including endothelial cells and pericytes. Methods: We constructed the Human NVU Atlas by integrating 11 publicly available snRNA-seq datasets, including vascular-enriched samples, from the human prefrontal cortex. This comprehensive dataset aggregates over 4.2 million nuclei from 748 donors, including AD patients and age-matched controls. We utilized a unified probabilistic pipeline based on deep generative models (SCVI) to perform batch-aware integration and employed an ensemble of supervised and deep-learning classifiers to rigorously re-annotate cell types. Differential expression and ligand-receptor interaction analyses were subsequently performed to identify cell-type-specific disruptions in males versus females. Results: The atlas successfully curated vascular populations from 11 studies to assemble the largest publicly available NVU cohort of endothelial cells (2.8%) and pericytes (1.9%) alongside astrocytes and neurons. Differential expression analysis revealed that while neurons predominantly exhibited gene downregulation in AD, vascular cells displayed a pattern of transcriptional hyperactivity with significant gene upregulation. We also identified pronounced sex-specific vulnerabilities; females exhibited distinct inflammatory signatures and downregulation of basement membrane collagen genes (e.g., COL4A1, COL4A2) in pericytes, whereas these changes were not observed in males. Moreover, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed a widespread loss of collagen-integrin signaling between pericytes and neurons, suggesting the involvement of extracellular matrix disruptions in NVU dysfunction observed in AD. Conclusion: The Human NVU Atlas provides a high-resolution, integrated transcriptomic framework for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity of the neurovascular unit. By uncovering sex-specific vascular mechanisms and disrupted intercellular communication, this resource highlights the critical role of vascular cells in AD progression and serves as a foundational reference for investigating cerebrovascular contribution to AD.

">Beyond Inheritance: De novo Fast Motion Computation in Primate Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Objects move through space and time, generating sequential visuotopic activations in all sighted animals leading to motion perception of velocity defined by direction and speed. Humans can effortlessly see motion with speeds ranging from 0.25 to 500deg/s. However, direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1)-from which all subsequent processing is presumed to derive-only encode directionality at low speeds. To resolve this paradox, we recorded neuronal responses to moving dots, gratings, and movies across the LGN, V1, MT and MST of the macaque motion pathway. Regardless of cell type and motion stimuli, V1 neurons lost direction selectivity at ~29deg/s while MT and MST neurons maintained it up to ~82deg/s and ~183deg/s, respectively. A cascaded spatiotemporal integration model reveals that at each cortex direction-selective neurons can generate velocity selectivity de novo, by integrating sequential visuotopic activations from preceding areas, irrespective of speed and directionality. By computing velocity anew, the primate brain effectively uses the cortical hierarchy itself to 'shift gears' to efficiently encode slow and fast motion. Thus, five visual areas from the retina into the brain's processing hierarchy, external spatiotemporal information is being computed afresh, offering insights for motion processing in other species, modalities and machine vision.

                Wide-field imaging from brain slices stained with a voltage sensitive dye (VSD) and simultaneously loaded with a Ca2+ indicator allows investigating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission at multi-cellular scale. So far, achieving this type of combined imaging has been limited by experimental constraints. We assessed the ability of the red-IR emitting VSD ElectroFluor630 (EF-630) to be combined with blue-excitable green-emitting Ca2+ indicators to record signals elicited by electrical stimulation in hippocampal slices. Transversal mouse hippocampal slices were stained with EF-630. Ca2+ indicators, either Fluo-4, Fluo-8, Cal520 or Calbryte520, were loaded using their AM-ester forms. Fluorescence, during stimulation of the CA3 region was imaged at 5 kHz from hippocampal areas of [~]750X250 square microns at 1 micron pixel resolution. After assessing all Ca2+ indicators, we selected Calbryte520 for achieving >30 minutes stable recordings in combination with EF-630. Action potentials and related Ca2+ transients were detected in the CA3 stimulated area whereas synaptic signals were observed in the CA1 region. On these signals, we tested the pharmacological blockade of either action potentials or glutamatergic synaptic potentials. We report novel optical measurements of both electrical and Ca2+ transients in brain slices, providing unique information on neuronal excitability and network activity.

">Theta activity in the RSC anchors space to the body cardinal axes</a></h4>

              
                Understanding human navigation in ecological, freely moving conditions requires uncovering how the brain anchors directional representations to the 's orientation. Using high-density mobile electroencephalography and immersive virtual reality during goal-directed whole-body rotations, we found that theta bursts reconstructed in the retrosplenial complex (RSC) encode both acceleration and alignment with the body's principal axes. Crucially, this body-axis-anchored neural signal emerged only during goal-directed rotations, and its strength correlated with individual navigation performance, suggesting an adaptive mechanism which provides a stable egocentric scaffold for orientation. These results provide compelling evidence for a self-motion-gated, body-centered reference frame that supports efficient navigation, and bridge the gap between static neuroimaging findings in humans and rodent research on RSC geometry codes. Overall, our findings advance an embodied, mechanistic account of human navigation, opening new avenues for investigating brain dynamics in naturalistic, movement-rich settings using non-invasive neural recordings.

">Asymmetrical modulation of fear expression via GABAB receptors in the mouse medial habenula</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (MHb) is implicated in regulating emotional responses to aversive events. Studies in zebrafish have identified a remarkable morphological left-right asymmetry in the dorsal habenula (zebrafish equivalent of mammalian MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway and its left-sided-specific role in modulating fear responses. However, there is little evidence for structural or functional lateralization in the mammalian MHb-IPN pathway. Here, we investigated the synaptic properties of left- and right-MHb afferents to the IPN and their roles in the expression of conditioned fear in mice. We found that each IPN neuron receives inputs from both left and right MHb, but the left MHb-originating synapses exhibit lower release probability and higher {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR)-mediated potentiation compared to the right MHb-originating synapses. Interestingly, these asymmetrical properties persist in the inversus visceral mutant mice with normal laterality of the internal organs (situs solitus), but nearly disappear in those with reversed internal organ laterality (situs inversus). Behaviorally, chemogenetic inhibition of cholinergic neurons and conditional deletion of GABABR in the left, but not the right, MHb significantly attenuated cue-dependent fear recall. Our results demonstrate functional asymmetry of the MHb under partial influence of the nodal flow in mice, revealing a predominant role of GABABR-mediated signaling in the left MHb-IPN pathway in modulating fear memories. These findings suggest that lateralized MHb pathways could represent a fundamental principle in the neural regulation of emotion across species, but that they develop differently in zebrafish and mice.

">Real-life ear-EEG Recordings of Auditory Responses to Ambient Sounds</a></h4>

              
                Despite being one of the most researched neural responses, auditory potentials have primarily been measured in controlled laboratory environments. However, there is a big interest in measuring auditory potentials in more naturalistic environments, with stimuli resembling, to a higher degree, natural sounds. The objective of this study is to investigate auditory evoked potentials elicited by naturally occurring sounds in real-life environments. The paper presents an integration of a portable hearing aid research platform and a portable ear-EEG platform. This setup was validated through recordings of an Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR), elicited by real-time amplitude modulation of the ambient sound at 40Hz. Recordings were conducted in real-life under three conditions: walking and sitting with open and closed eyes. In addition to ear-EEG, scalp EEG was recorded as a reference. For analysis, EEG signals were categorized into three groups: scalp channels, cross-ear channels, and within-ear channels. For each condition and channel group, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the ASSR was calculated. The ASSR was statistically significant across all channel groups and conditions. A post-hoc analysis assessed the recording duration required to obtain a significant ASSR, revealing that 10 minutes were enough for within ear ear-EEG for all but two cases, whereas less than 7 minutes were sufficient for all but one case when using scalp-EEG.

">Genetic rescue of disrupted synaptic protein interaction network dynamics following SYNGAP1 reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic protein interaction networks (PINs) dynamically translate neural activity into biochemical signals that regulate synaptic structure and plasticity. Disruption of these coordinated networks is a common feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, yet it remains unclear whether the molecular organization of a perturbed network can be restored after development. Here, we examined how post-developmental re-expression of the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein SynGAP1 affects network structure and signaling dynamics in a conditional SynGAP1 haploinsufficient mouse. Quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation (QMI) across development revealed that SynGAP haploinsufficiency selectively reduced SynGAP-containing complexes without broadly disrupting NMDA-dependent network responses. Tamoxifen-inducible re-expression of SynGAP at postnatal day 21 fully restored both steady-state and activity-dependent interactions within the SynGAP module in hippocampus, and additionally normalized secondary alterations in Shank-Homer scaffolding complexes in somatosensory cortex. These data demonstrate that biochemical restoration of a disrupted synaptic network is achievable, even after early developmental windows have closed. Our findings suggest that while critical periods may constrain functional recovery, molecular network normalization remains possible through genetic reactivation of haploinsufficient synaptic regulators.

">A paradoxical impact of alcohol on sleep-memory coupling</a></h4>

              
                Sleep serves a fundamental role in memory consolidation, and yet it must adapt to the organism's physiological state. Acute ethanol consumption has a profound impact on animal physiology, but whether intoxication affects the role of sleep in memory consolidation remains unexplored. We demonstrate that acute ethanol exerts a paradoxical dual impact on sleep-memory coupling in Drosophila. Typically, satiated flies require sleep for memory consolidation, but starved flies that must forage for food switch to sleep-independent memory. Ethanol selectively impairs memory consolidation in satiated flies, whereas memories in starved flies remain intact despite intoxication. The observed impairment in satiated flies is due to a switch to sleep-independent memory, which then can't be supported because of ethanol-induced sedation. Mechanistically, the ethanol-induced switch to sleep-independent memory is driven by neuropeptide F-mediated modulation of dopamine signaling. These findings reveal that ethanol intoxication inverts the canonical function of sleep, wherein it becomes detrimental to memory consolidation.

">An extended structure of the intracellular domain of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and its proposed interactions with rapsyn</a></h4>

              
                To gain insight into the interactions between rapsyn and the nAChR that induce clustering at the post-synaptic membrane, we refined a cryo-EM dataset using an intracellular domain focused strategy to obtain a 3.0 [A] map with the most extensive density yet for the intracellular domain of the Torpedo nAChR. The improved map allowed us to extend the structure beyond the MX -helix and prior to the MA -helix of the intracellular domain. The new structure defines a sharp N-terminal boundary of each MA -helix to place agrin-dependent phosphorylated tyrosines unambiguously within the flexible regions of the MX-MA loops. Two distinct conformations of the {delta} M4 -helix were also resolved, indicating that M4 conformational heterogeneity reflects intrinsic flexibility rather than a change in gating state. The new structural constraints defined for the MX-MA loop were then used to evaluate AlphaFold3-predicted full-length models of the nAChR, rapsyn, and various rapsyn-nAChR complexes, identifying a consistent, asymmetric 3:1 binding architecture where each rapsyn is always sandwiched between the MX-MA loops from two subunits and where each phospho-tyrosine is lodged in a cationic pocket formed by conserved residues implicated in congenital myasthenic syndromes. The defined architecture fits published cryo-ET maps of Torpedo post-synaptic membranes and explains how both phosphorylated tyrosines and myasthenic syndrome-causing rapsyn mutations modulate receptor clustering.

">Selective impairment of spatial recognition memory and reduced frontal corticothalamic spine density following adolescent alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Heavy alcohol use is common during adolescence and is associated with increased risk of alcohol use disorder and prevalence of residual cognitive deficits, especially in behaviors associated with the latently developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). A major need for advancing our understanding of this relationship is replicable and accessible preclinical behavioral batteries that can be used to disassociate the effects of adolescent alcohol on select PFC circuits. Electrophysiological evidence implicates projections from the PFC to mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MdT) as being uniquely impacted by adolescent intermittent alcohol consumption in mice. The present study aims to evaluate if voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence impacts anxiety or PFC-associated spatial and recognition memory and if they are associated with morphological changes to the PFC-MdT circuit. Our results indicate that compared to water-only controls, male and female mice that voluntarily consumed alcohol during adolescence demonstrate performance deficits in the object-in-place recognition task, without affecting the novel object recognition task, Y-maze alternation, anxiety or locomotion, an outcome consistent with PFC and MdT dysfunction. Morphological assessment of PFC neurons from male and female mice following behavioral tasks found a reduction in spine density in basal and apical, but not oblique dendrites of PFC-MdT neurons. Collectively, these results implicate the PFC to MdT circuit integrity as a potential locus of the effects of adolescent alcohol on spatial recognition memory.

">Astrocyte senescence impairs synaptogenesis due to Thrombospondin-1 loss.</a></h4>

              
                Cellular senescence is an irreversible state linked to aging that involves molecular and functional alterations. The mammalian hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet the role of cellular senescence in hippocampal aging remains underexplored. Here, we report an early onset of senescence signatures in hippocampal astrocytes of the accelerated aging and frailty mouse model SAMP8. We examine how astrocyte senescence affects excitatory synapse formation, focusing on soluble signals released by astrocytes. Astrocytes isolated from SAMP8 brain and those differentiated from SAMP8 neural stem cells show senescence hallmarks (SA-{beta}-gal, p16INK4a, Lamin B1 loss), alongside a significant reduction in synaptogenic function. While astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from control mice promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin-1 / 2{delta}-1 neuronal receptor signalling, ACM from senescent SAMP8 astrocytes lacks this capacity. Supplementing senescent ACM with thrombospondin-1 protein, or overexpressing thrombospondin-1 gene in senescent astrocytes, reinstates synaptogenesis. At the hippocampal level, thrombospondin-1 and synaptic puncta are reduced in SAMP8 mice. Our findings reveal that senescent astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptogenic capacity due to thrombospondin-1 loss, highlighting their contribution to synaptic dysfunction during aging. Preventing senescence in hippocampal astrocytes may thus restore astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in the aged brain.

">DNM2-CMT neuropathy stems from disrupted Schwann cell function and shows limited therapeutic reversibility</a></h4>

              
                Dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy characterized by sensory and motor deficits associated with myelin and/or axonal abnormalities and muscle atrophy. Increasing DNM2 activity from embryogenesis has been reported to ameliorate neuromuscular phenotypes in the Dnm2K562E/+ CMT mouse; however, this model displays predominantly muscle pathology and limited nerve involvement, precluding rigorous evaluation of neuropathic mechanisms and potential therapies. Here, we performed comprehensive behavioral, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses to characterize the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse, which combines systemic heterozygosity for the common K562E mutation together with Schwann cell (SC)-specific deletion of wild-type Dnm2. This model faithfully reproduces key clinical and pathological features of DNM2-CMT, including motor deficits, reduced general force and coordination, and severe sensory and motor conduction deficits associated with axonal loss, demyelination, and inflammation. Mechanistically, we delineate a coherent pathological sequence that explains the profound functional deficits. In particular, a downregulation of the transcription factor EGR2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and of the myelin protein MPZ correlates with demyelination. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 supplementation, post-symptomatic intrathecal delivery of AAV9-DNM2 driven by the Schwann cell-specific MPZ promoter was performed at 4 weeks. Although DNM2 expression increased in peripheral nerves (~1.9-fold), no significant improvements were observed across behavioural, electrophysiological, structural, or molecular parameters. Together, these findings establish the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse as a robust preclinical model, recapitulating key features of DNM2-CMT, and provides crucial insight into the biological and temporal constraints that must guide future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-CMT.

">A deformable attractor manifold organizes human resting-state brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic brain activity is often described as wandering within a continuous multivariate space, yet the organizing principles that constrain these dynamics remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous human brain activity during rest is structured by a deformable attractor manifold. Using large-scale fMRI datasets and a latent dynamical model, we find that cortical activity occupies two reproducible regimes: a low-coherence state with a unimodal latent distribution and a high-coherence state that exhibits bimodality, consistent with transient bistability across association networks. A compact two-parameter energy landscape explains these dynamics, revealing that transitions arise not from switching between discrete states, but from continuous deformation of the manifold that reshapes attractor geometry. Excursions into the bistable regime occur as rapid "jumps", whereas returns follow slow drifts along the manifold, reflecting network-specific timescales. Individuals with greater expression of the bistable regime show higher cognitive fluidity, and manifold parameters differentiate mild cognitive impairment from matched controls. These findings identify an organizing geometric and dynamical principle of resting activity, linking large-scale cortical coordination, cognitive variability, and vulnerability to pathology.

">Awareness is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based motor attenuation</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding theories posit that the brain continuously updates internal models of the world to anticipate sensory input. Attenuation of neural responses to predictable sensory stimuli is thought to aid in this process of prediction error detection and model updating. The topic of whether predictive processes such as sensory attenuation can occur in minimally conscious states has been hotly debated. The current study provides a novel test for the role of awareness in prediction-based attenuation using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) prediction task, whereby predictable stimulation is known to lead to attenuated motor system excitability. The experiment tested whether motor attenuation can occur without awareness using a dual task paradigm to mask a predictive cueing relationship. Participants simultaneously completed an n-back task and a TMS-counting task; critically, a visual cue (in the n-back task) consistently predicted the occurrence of a TMS pulse (in the counting task). Instruction conditions manipulated how much participants were informed of this relationship, and awareness was assessed in a post-experimental questionnaire. The results reveal that motor attenuation was present only in participants instructed about the relationship, or in those who became aware of the cue-TMS association. Implicit, predictable cue-TMS exposure was not sufficient to elicit motor attenuation in unaware participants. These findings show that awareness of the relationship is necessary for predictive learning and prediction-based attenuation in the motor system, challenging the assumption that predictive coding operates automatically.

                Recent developments in imaging facilitate large-scale three-dimensional (3D) neuronal recording. While these huge amounts of data shed new light on population-level neural coding, it is much harder to extract neuronal calcium dynamics from 3D volumes than 2D images with the existence of noise and scattering. Here, we presented DeepWonder3D, a general end-to-end pipeline for rapid and robust 3D neuronal extraction with high fidelity. Instead of processing voxel by voxel, DeepWonder3D works on the multi-view projections of 3D imaging data obtained either digitally or optically through specific point spread functions (PSFs) for general applicability to diverse techniques, including point-scanning microscopy, light-field microscopy, and two-photon synthetic aperture microscopy. Integrating denoising, resolution registration, background removal, neuronal extraction, and multi-view fusion into a unified pipeline tailored for large-scale high-resolution datasets contaminated by noise and scattering, DeepWonder3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D localization accuracy with a 10-fold reduction in computational costs, validated by numerical simulations and a hybrid two-photon/light-field imaging system. With the RUSH3D mesoscope, DeepWonder3D achieves rapid high-fidelity 3D calcium extraction of tens of thousands of neurons across the mouse cortex within hours.

">Signatures of remote planning in hippocampal replay</a></h4>

              
                During brief, intermittent "replay" events, hippocampal activity can express navigational trajectories disconnected from both when and where they originally occurred. While replay biased toward immediate future goals has been observed, there is no evidence yet linking replay to planning beyond the next action. Here, we designed a sequential spatial working memory task which required rats to utilize information across multiple temporally separated actions. Remote replay events matched the animal's future navigational choices made after completing an intervening subtask. Critically, this occurred only when the replayed information was useful for reducing memory load, consistent with it being an active process. Our findings suggest these remote replay events are a neural correlate of episodic forethought, allowing animals to use memories to plan beyond their immediate surroundings.

Site-specific GlcNAc or high-mannose glycans at Asn359 or Asn410 remodel heparin and RNA binding kinetics in biolayer interferometry assays, revealing avidity-dominated, slow-off heparin interactions that are dampened by N-glycans and faster RNA interactions that can be potentiated by small GlcNAc modifications. Cross-seeding experiments show that N-glycosylation selectively tunes nucleation compatibility between tau proteoforms; GlcNAc at Asn410 in full-length tau and small glycans at Asn359 in K18 most strongly accelerate aggregation. In HEK293T FRET biosensor cells and iPSC-derived cortical neurons, N-glycans enhance or suppress seeding and pHrodo-reported uptake in a site- and glycan-dependent manner, with Asn410 glycosylation markedly potentiating cellular seeding. Pharmacological inhibition with atropine, dynasore, and cytochalasin D further indicates that N-glycans rebalance muscarinic, dynamin-dependent, and actin-dependent uptake routes. Together, these data establish N-linked glycosylation as a tunable regulator of tau trafficking and prion-like spread, coupling extracellular receptor usage to intracellular cofactor engagement, and reveals druggable nodes in uptake.

">The emergence of intentional action in early human infancy</a></h4>

              
                Intention lies at the core of human behavior, allowing flexible and goal-directed interaction with the environment. However, how it emerges in infancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that intentional action can emerge before overt reaching, revealing that 3-month-old infants display pupil dilation preceding self-initiated actions during interaction with a suspended mobile toy. This phasic pupil dilation first appeared after movement onset but gradually shifted to precede it through environmental interaction, reflecting the emergence of action preparation and prediction of action outcomes. This shift also implies that infants are capable of anticipating the timing of their forthcoming movements. Furthermore, the antecedent pupil dilation occurred only with efficient movements characterised by reduced muscle co-contractions. These findings suggest that infants learn to predict outcomes of their own actions and initiate particular movements at self-determined timings, marking the emergence of intentional action.

                <p>Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an increased incidence of seizures, which worsen cognitive decline. Using a transgenic mouse model of AD neuropathology that exhibits spontaneous seizures, we previously found that seizure activity stimulates and accelerates depletion of the hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) pool, which was associated with deficits in neurogenesis-dependent spatial discrimination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that drive seizure-induced activation and depletion of NSCs are unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we performed RNA-sequencing on the hippocampal dentate gyrus and identified differentially expressed regulators of neurogenesis in the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates many aspects of cell proliferation. We found that the expression of sFRP3, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, is altered in a seizure-dependent manner and might be regulated by FosB, a seizure-induced transcription factor. Increasing sFRP3 expression prevented NSC depletion and improved spatial discrimination, suggesting that the loss of sFRP3 might mediate seizure-driven impairment in cognition in AD model mice and perhaps also in AD.</p>

                <p>Decision-making is influenced by both expected rewards and social factors, such as who offers the outcomes. Therefore, although a reward might originally be independent of social factors, the two elements are closely related. However, whether and how they are processed separately or conjointly remains unclear. Here, we show that neurons in distinct subnuclei of the amygdala encode expected reward and face reality, a vital aspect of face perception. Although these encoding processes are distinct, they rely on partially shared neuronal circuits with characteristic temporal dynamics. Two male macaque monkeys made saccades under different social and reward contexts by viewing facial images with independent attributes: reality (a real monkey or a cartoon face) and associated reward (large or small). The stimulus image was presented twice per trial: during initial stimulus encoding (S1) and before saccades were made (S2). A longer gaze duration for the eye region of the monkeys compared with cartoons indicated more robust social engagement with realistic faces. During S1, a similar number of lateral nucleus neurons encoded either reality only, with a monkey-image preference; reward only, with a large-reward preference; or both. Conversely, neurons in the basal and central nuclei primarily encoded reward, preferring large- versus small-reward&ndash;associated face images. Reward-dependent modulation continued after S1 but was more conspicuous during S1 in the basal nucleus and during both S1 and S2 in the central nucleus. This anatomically and temporally specific encoding in the amygdala may underlie the computation and integration of social and reward information.</p>

                <p>Odor detection in mammals is primarily mediated by odorant receptors (ORs), the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors, expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Buck and Axel, 1991</cross-ref>). However, most ORs exhibit little or no cell surface expression in nonolfactory cell types (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Lu et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">Hague et al., 2004</cross-ref>). While the accessory protein RTP1 and RTP2 enhance the expression of certain ORs, we hypothesized that additional proteins coregulated with RTP1 and RTP2 during OSN maturation may further enhance OR cell surface expression (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Saito et al., 2004</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Zhuang and Matsunami, 2007</cross-ref>). To test this, we developed a computational pipeline based on publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data to create an interactive tool for exploring gene expression during OSN maturation. Using this tool, we identified genes coregulated with Rtp1 during olfactory development. Three genes&mdash;Gfy, Clgn, and Syt1&mdash;exhibited transcriptional profiles similar to Rtp1. When coexpressed with an OR, these genes, in combination with Rtp1, promoted cell-surface expression of the tested ORs. Importantly, we demonstrated a physical interaction between Syt1 and an OR (Or1ad1) via co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel role for Syt1 in OR trafficking or stabilization. We also observed localization of Syt1 protein in OSN cilia in both male and female mice. Together, these findings provide new insights into OSN development and the molecular mechanisms underlying OR biogenesis, paving the way for further research into the functional regulation of the olfactory systems.</p>

                <p>Predictions of future events have a major impact on how we process sensory signals. However, it remains unclear how the brain keeps predictions online in anticipation of future inputs. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate decoding techniques to investigate the content of perceptual predictions and their frequency characteristics. Thirty-two participants (23 female) were engaged in a shape discrimination task, while auditory cues predicted which specific shape would likely appear. Frequency analysis revealed significant oscillatory fluctuations of predicted shape representations in the pre-stimulus window in the alpha band (10&ndash;11&nbsp;Hz). Furthermore, we found that this stimulus-specific alpha power was linked to expectation effects on shape discrimination behavior. Our findings demonstrate that sensory predictions are embedded in pre-stimulus alpha oscillations and modulate subsequent perceptual performance, providing a neural mechanism through which the brain deploys perceptual predictions.</p>

                <p>Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides regulate numerous essential functions including sleep/wake state stability and reward processing. Orexin synthesizing neurons respond to drug cues and undergo structural changes following persistent drug exposure. Postmortem brains from opioid users and opioid-treated rodents have orexin somata that become ~20% smaller and ~50% more numerous and are postulated to promote hypermotivation for drug seeking though increased orexin release. Biophysical considerations suggest that the decreased soma size should increase cellular excitability; however, the impact of chronic opioids on firing ability, which drives peptide release, has not been explored. To test this, we assessed the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons by whole-cell recordings in slices from male orexin-EGFP mice treated for 2&nbsp;weeks by daily morphine or saline injections. Paradoxically, we found that while daily morphine decreased the average soma size, it impaired excitability in a subpopulation of orexin neurons identified by electrophysiological criteria as "H-type" while entirely sparing "D-type" neurons. This impairment was manifest by smaller, broader action potentials, variable firing, and a downscaling of firing gain. These adaptations required more than a single morphine dose and recovered, along with soma size, after 4&nbsp;weeks of passive withdrawal. Taken together, these observations indicate that daily opioid exposure differentially impacts H-type orexin neurons and predicts that the ability of these neurons to encode synaptic inputs into spike trains and to release neuropeptides becomes impaired in conjunction with opioid dependence.</p>

                <p>Understanding speech while ignoring competing speech streams in the surrounding environment is challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that attention shapes the neural representation of speech features. Attended streams are typically represented more strongly than unattended ones, suggesting either enhancement of the attended or suppression of the unattended stream. However, it is unclear how these complementary processes support attentional filtering and speech comprehension on different hierarchical levels. In this study, we used multivariate temporal response functions to analyze the EEG signals of 43 young adults (24 women), examining the relationship between the neural tracking of acoustic and higher-level linguistic features and a fine-grained speech comprehension measure. We show that the neural tracking of word and phoneme onsets and word level linguistic features in the attended stream predicted comprehension at the individual single-trial level. Moreover, acoustic tracking of the ignored speech stream was positively correlated with comprehension performance, whereas word level linguistic neural tracking of the ignored stream was negatively correlated with comprehension. Collectively, our results suggest that attentional filtering during speech comprehension requires target enhancement as well as distractor suppression at different hierarchical levels.</p>

                <p>How is spatial attention deployed in mental images? Mental imagery is often assumed to share mechanisms with visual perception and visual working memory. Top-down, endogenous spatial attention in both visual perception and working memory modulates behavior and parieto-occipital alpha-band activity. However, working memory captures only a subset of mental imagery, which can also draw upon long-term memory. Here, we ask whether and how spatial attention operates in mental images derived from general knowledge in long-term memory and whether it recruits the same neural mechanisms as visual perception. We recorded EEG in 28 healthy volunteers (13 males, 15 females) as they performed two discrimination tasks with spatial cues (70% valid): one involving the mental visualization of a long-term memory map (a map of France) and the other using visual stimuli. We show that spatial attention shortens response times in both tasks, but through distinct mechanisms. Behavioral attentional benefits were uncorrelated across tasks, and spatial attention in mental imagery engaged distinct neural mechanisms, with frontal rather than posterior alpha activity modulation. We further reveal fundamental differences in the spatial structures of mental imagery and visual perception. Altogether, our results show that mental images drawn from long-term semantic memory are spatially organized and are amenable to spatial attention deployment, but the underlying neural mechanisms differ from those of visual perception. Our results thus point to marked differences between mental imagery from long-term memory and visual perception.</p>

                <p>A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch behavior are unknown. Here we trained five head-fixed male and 11 female mice in a go-cue task to move a whisker to touch a sensor. Our analysis of orofacial movements shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e., whether go-cue triggered movement had begun or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude, and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task&mdash;to touch the sensor within 2&nbsp;s&mdash;how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic transmission within the ventral striatum is broadly implicated in risk/reward decision-making and impulse control, and the rat gambling task (rGT) measures both behaviors concurrently. While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviors uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the relative importance of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary as learning progresses; the former should dominate while rats learn the probabilistic contingencies of the task, whereas suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is established and exploited. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically influence reinforcement learning by modulating dopamine (DA) release and gating periods of DA-facilitated neuroplasticity. We therefore hypothesized that ventral striatal CINs (vsCINs) could influence reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or stable performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics in Sprague Dawley rats (<I>Rattus norvegicus</I>), we found support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of vsCINs once behavior was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting vsCINs during task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity but instead decreased and increased risky choice, respectively. Notably, the former effect was only observed in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing testable predictions regarding acetylcholine&ndash;DA interactions that may explain sex differences.</p>

                <p>Disorders characterized by changes in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are often linked to changes in the temporal discounting of future rewards. Likewise, pharmacological manipulations of DA neurotransmission in healthy individuals modulate temporal discounting, but there is considerable variability in the directionality of reported pharmacological effects, as enhancements and reductions of DA signaling have been linked to both increases and reductions of temporal discounting. This may be due to meaningful individual differences in drug effects and/or false-positive findings in small samples. To resolve these inconsistencies, we (1) revisited pharmacological effects of the DA precursor <scp>l</scp>-DOPA on temporal discounting in a large sample of <I>N</I> = 76 healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 44 male) and (2) examined several putative proxy measures for DA to revisit the role of individual differences in a randomized, double-blind placebo&ndash;controlled preregistered study (<A HREF="https://osf.io/a4k9j/">https://osf.io/a4k9j/</A>). Replicating previous findings, higher rewards were discounted less (magnitude effect). Computational modeling using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation confirmed that the data in both drug conditions were best accounted for by a nonlinear temporal discounting drift diffusion model. In line with recent animal and human work, <scp>l</scp>-DOPA reliably reduced the discount rate with a small effect size, challenging earlier findings in substantially smaller samples. We found no credible evidence for effects of putative DA proxy measures on model parameters, calling into question the role of these measures in accounting for individual differences in DA drug effects.</p>

                <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses, a process fundamental to learning. CaMKII responds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into postsynaptic spines by phosphorylating proteins and forming new protein interactions. The relative importance of these enzymatic and structural functions is debated. LTP induction triggers CaMKII docking to NMDA receptors, and recent evidence indicates that LTP can proceed without kinase activity after this event. Furthermore, interactions between CaMKII and &alpha;-actinin-2 that form following LTP induction are required for dendritic spine enlargement. CaMKII can autophosphorylate at T286, which enables autonomous activity after Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dissociation. Experiments with CaMKII variants including a T305A/T306A ("AA") double substitution have led to a model whereby T305/T306 phosphorylation by autonomously active CaMKII prevents further Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activation. However, this mechanism is not fully compatible with previous studies including a phosphoproteomic analysis of CaMKII and imaging using CaMKII activity reporters in live neurons. In this study, we show using rat hippocampal cultures that the AA substitution has an unintended gain-of-function property: elevated binding to &alpha;-actinin-2 in unstimulated neurons to a level only normally observed after induction of LTP. CaMKII&alpha; AA also increases the proportion of enlarged spines in unstimulated neurons without altering synaptic currents. Calorimetric measurements with purified protein confirm that &alpha;-actinin-2 binds tightly to CaMKII&alpha; AA with no requirement for kinase activation. Using x-ray crystallography, we show that the AA substitution enables &alpha;-actinin-2 to adopt a different tighter binding mode. Our findings reinforce the notion that CaMKII primarily fulfils a structural role in LTP.</p>

                <p>Neural oscillations have been associated with decision-making processes, but their underlying network mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates how neural oscillations influence decision network models of competing cortical columns with varying intrinsic and emergent timescales. Our findings reveal that decision networks with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses are more susceptible to oscillatory modulations. Higher in-phase oscillation amplitude reduces decision confidence without affecting accuracy, while decision speed increases. In contrast, antiphase modulation increases decision accuracy, confidence, and speed. Increasing oscillation frequency reverses these effects. Changing oscillatory phase difference gradually modulates decision behavior, with decision confidence affected nonlinearly. Moreover, neural resonance can further enhance modulatory susceptibility for network with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses. These effects decouple decision accuracy, speed, and confidence, challenging standard speed-accuracy trade-off. These phenomena can be explained by excitatory neural populations contributing more to in-phase modulation, while inhibitory neural populations contribute more to antiphase modulation. State-space trajectories&rsquo; momentum swinging with respect to network steady states and decision uncertainty manifold further provide insights into the neural circuit mechanisms. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how neurobiological diversity shapes decision-making processes in the presence of ubiquitous neural oscillations.</p>

                <p>In the retina, presynaptic active zones in photoreceptors and bipolar cells are distinguished by a plate-like "ribbon" linked to the plasma membrane (PM) and surrounded by dozens of synaptic vesicles (SVs) tethered to it. SVs at the base of the ribbon, closest to the PM, are thought to constitute the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP), i.e., SVs primed to be released 1&ndash;2&nbsp;ms following stimulation. The number of SVs in the RRP is a critical synaptic parameter that influences synaptic strength and varies with light levels to enable ribbon synapses to compute visual information. Physiological RRP measurements agree well with anatomical estimates obtained via electron microscopy (EM), although EM often employs chemical fixation, which causes exocytotic artifacts that may influence RRP size. Here, we used EM tomography to compare anatomical features of rod bipolar cell ribbon synapses in retinas, from rats of either sex, prepared by chemical fixation or high-pressure freezing (HPF), a technique that minimizes artifactual exocytosis. We found that ribbon dimensions and the number of ribbon-associated SVs were roughly similar in the two preparations. Cleft volume and SV diameter were larger in HPF-prepared tissue, however, and vesicles at the base of the ribbon were more closely associated with the PM, suggesting morphologically distinguishable steps in the SV priming process. The distribution of SV diameters was positively skewed in both conditions, but larger SVs were too scarce to explain previous electrophysiological results, which likely reflect multivesicular release at the PM rather than prefusion of SVs prior to exocytosis.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior requires integrating information from multiple sources. These sources can originate from distinct channels, such as internally maintained latent cognitive representations or externally presented sensory cues. Because these signals are often stochastic and carry inherent uncertainty, integration is challenging. However, the neural and computational mechanisms that support the integration of such stochastic information remain unknown. We introduce a computational neuroimaging framework to elucidate how brain systems integrate internally maintained and externally cued stochastic information to guide behavior. Neuroimaging data were collected from healthy adult human participants (both male and female). Our computational model estimates trial-by-trial beliefs about internally maintained latent states and externally presented perceptual cues and then integrates them into a unified joint probability distribution. The entropy of this joint distribution quantifies overall uncertainty, which enables continuous tracking of probabilistic task beliefs, prediction errors, and updating dynamics. Results showed that latent-state beliefs are encoded in distinct regions from perceptual beliefs. Latent state beliefs were encoded in the anterior middle frontal gyrus, mediodorsal thalamus, and inferior parietal lobule, whereas perceptual beliefs were encoded in spatially distinct regions including lateral temporo-occipital areas, intraparietal sulcus, and precentral sulcus. The integrated joint probability and its entropy converged in frontoparietal hub areas, notably middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus. These findings suggest that frontoparietal hubs read out and resolve distributed uncertainty to flexibly guide behavior, revealing how frontoparietal systems implement cognitive integration.</p>

                <p>Interference between visual short-term memory (VSTM) and task-irrelevant sensory distractors is a well-documented phenomenon across a wide range of visual features. Although this sensory&ndash;memory interference is believed to result from neural interactions between mnemonic and sensory processing, the nature of the interfering signals remains unclear, particularly whether the interference originates from physical stimuli entering the retina or the resulting subjective perception. Here we addressed this question by leveraging perceptual invariance during smooth pursuit eye movements, where retinal motion induced by eye movements is perceptually suppressed. Distractors were presented as either physical object motion in world coordinates or apparent motion of a stationary background induced by eye movements, allowing us to generate identical retinal motion with distinct perception. Human observers (both female and male) were tasked with comparing the speeds of two sequentially presented motion stimuli while ignoring the distractor stimuli presented between them. Our results showed that the retinal motion distractor systematically biased the memorized motion speed. Crucially, the magnitude of the bias was comparable regardless of whether the retinal motion distractor reflected physical or apparent motion. Notably, the distraction effect of the eye movement-induced retinal motion was successfully replicated using a classifier trained on data from the physical motion condition. A further experiment confirmed that this distraction effect by the apparent motion was not due to eye movements themselves. These findings provide behavioral evidence that, at least for the feature of motion speed, perception is not required for the emergence of a bias in VSTM.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum is crucial for predictive motor control and learning, but growing evidence suggests that it also generates forward models for nonmotor functions. Previous studies have reported periodic neuronal activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus when animals predicted the timing of regularly presented visual stimuli. Since the dentate nucleus is an output structure, this activity likely reflects computations in the cerebellar cortex. Considering that Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, are more numerous than cerebellar nuclear neurons and that nuclear neurons also receive input from mossy and climbing fibers, information integration likely occurs within the cerebellar nuclei. To explore this, we recorded PC activity in the cerebellar crus lobules of three male monkeys trained to detect the omission of periodically flashing visual stimuli and compared it with dentate nucleus data. PCs showed gradually increasing periodic simple spike activity, with amplitudes proportional to the interstimulus intervals. As a population, PC signals slightly preceded those of dentate nucleus neurons and were more temporally variable. However, the individual dentate neuron activity was 84% explained by a linear sum of signals from a small subset of PCs. These results suggest that the main components of cerebellar output signals for temporal prediction may originate from the cerebellar cortex and are integrated within the deep nuclei before being sent to other brain regions. Furthermore, changes in complex spike activity were observed in more than half of the PCs, suggesting that synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex may contribute to modulating these signals.</p>

                <p>In the CA1 hippocampus, pyramidal cells (PCs) can be classified as deep or superficial based on their radial position within the stratum pyramidale. Deep and superficial PCs form biased circuits with perisomatic-targeting PV+ basket cells, but it is unknown if such cell-type&ndash;specific circuit motifs extend to dendrite-targeting interneurons. Using male and female mice, we investigated synaptic connectivity and physiology in brain slices from four transgenic lines thought to capture distinct subsets of interneurons: SST-IRES-Cre, Nkx2.1-Cre, Chrna2-Cre, and Htr3a-GFP. First, we found that oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells captured by the Chrna2-Cre line are a subset of Htr3a-GFP+ cells in the hippocampus. This novel finding is consistent with previous work showing Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells are distinct from both Chrna2-Cre and Htr3a-GFP+ OLM cells. Indeed, in paired whole-cell recordings, Nkx2.1-Cre+ interneurons in the stratum oriens, but not Chrna2-Cre+ or Htr3a-GFP+ cells, received more excitatory synaptic connections from superficial PCs relative to deep PCs. Next, we expressed channelrhodopsin in interneurons to investigate inhibition along the proximal and distal dendrites of PCs. We found that superficial PCs received stronger inhibition along their proximal dendrites than deep PCs from SST+ interneurons. Furthermore, this circuit motif was dependent on the layer but not PC projection class. Finally, Chrna2-Cre OLM cells provided stronger inhibition to the distal dendrites of deep PCs relative to superficial PCs. Our data reveal that superficial and deep PCs engage in cell-type&ndash;specific circuits with dendrite-targeting interneurons. Furthermore, they support that Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells and Chrna2-Cre/Htr3a-GFP OLM cells are distinct subtypes that form unique circuits in CA1.</p>

                <p>Humans can extract numerosity from different senses and a variety of context. How and where the brain abstract numerical information from low-level sensory inputs remains debated. Using multivariate pattern decoding and representational similarity analysis applied to fMRI data (collected from both male and female participants), we comprehensively investigate how the brain represents numerical information (range 2&ndash;5) across different modalities (auditory, visual) and presentation formats (sequential, simultaneous; symbolic, nonsymbolic). We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway&mdash;from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions&mdash;that encode specific nonsymbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format. Maintaining a distinction between spatial and temporal numerical representations may thus be a fundamental aspect of numerical processing. RSA further revealed a posterior-to-anterior gradient in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing that the dominant factors influencing distributed numerical representations shifted from sensory modality in the posterior parietal regions to presentation format in the anterior parietal areas. Our study reveals a multifaceted brain representation of numerosity across the senses and presentation formats.</p>

                <p>Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive tumor in the adult central nervous system, remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its high recurrence and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent evidence underscores the pivotal role of glioma stem cells (GSCs) in driving these malignant features. In this study, using intracranial xenograft models established in 4-week-old male BALB/c nude mice and patient-derived primary GSCs, we uncover a critical function of the chromatin assembly factor subunit Chaf1b in sustaining the stemness of GSCs and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. We show that Chaf1b is markedly overexpressed in high-grade gliomas and GSC populations. Genetic silencing of Chaf1b led to a significant reduction in GSC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, both in vitro and in intracranial xenograft models. Mechanistically, Chaf1b was found to upregulate IL-33 secretion, thereby promoting microglial M2 polarization and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway&mdash;effects that were reversible upon IL-33 neutralization. These findings position Chaf1b as a key mediator of GBM aggressiveness and suggest it as a promising target for disrupting the stem-immune axis in GBM.</p>

                <p>Current theories of event memory propose distinct connections between the hippocampus and neocortical regions, particularly those within the default mode network (DMN) subsystems, to support processing different types of content in memory. It has been established that hippocampal connectivity supports integrating this disparate content into unified event memories, suggesting that changing the way that an event is described could change the underlying hippocampal neural network. To address this knowledge gap, we developed event narratives that described the same core story (e.g., grocery shopping) with identical central story details described with additional descriptive details that were conceptually or perceptually related to the story. Using fMRI, we established hippocampal connectivity patterns as a group of human participants (<I>N</I> = 35, of any sex) encoded these narratives and then related these patterns to later memory for the narrative details. Consistent with prior work, we found that the conceptual narratives were associated with stronger anterior hippocampal connectivity to regions within the core and dorsomedial DMN subsystems, and a portion of this connectivity pattern predicted memory for the core story of the narrative. The perceptual narratives were selectively associated with anterior hippocampal connectivity to parietal and lateral temporal regions and regions outside the standard DMN, in relation to memory performance. These results provide new insights into hippocampal and DMN functional organization and how distinct neural components contribute differently to event memory.</p>

                Background and aims Infectious aneurysm is an aneurysm of the arteries originating from endogenous bacteraemia due to bacterial or fungal origin. The major vessels involved are femoral, aorta, then intracranial visceral arteries and pulmonary arteries. These aneurysms are identified by their fusiform shape, multiple, distal location involving the entire wall of the vessel and changing morphology on repeat imaging studies. The study aims to discuss the clinical presentation & management of post infectious aneurysms. Methods This is a retrospective study of 11 case series of postinfectious aneurysms over a period of 10 years admitted at a tertiary care hospital. The detailed clinical data that included the clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment was studied from the hospital medical records department and laboratory information system. Results Among the 11 patients diagnosed with aneurysms, 4 presented with intracranial, 4 with intra pulmonary and 3 with intra-abdominal aortic aneurysms involvement. Source was either of bacterial cause such as E.coli, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Salmonella Typhi, M. tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Methicillin Resistant S. aureus, S. hominis or fungal origin being Aspergillus spp. All of them had elevated C-reactive protein level, ESR and confirmed by positive cultures or Xpert Tb. Management of mycotic aneurysm includes imaging studies along with laboratory workup, endovascular intervention with intravenous antibiotics, or a combination of these. Conclusion High index of suspicion in patients presenting with fever, elevated C-reactive protein, ESR, total counts with sudden development of atypical aneurysms requires timely blood culture pre and post procedure. Definitive surgical/endovascular under antibiotic coverage at the earliest is a prerequisite in the management to prevent re-rupture.

                Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal, metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age. It can be induced by genetic, immunological, and environmental determinants. The main pathophysiology of PCOS, is hyperandrogenism, which can lead to acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, as well as infertility. However, PCOS is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the role of, (anti-FSH, and anti-LH antibodies, in PCOS occurrence). Methods About 65 patients with PCOS, and 56 healthy women (controls) were recruited. Their ages were (20-45) years. Body mass index BMI was computed as, (weight) divided by (height squared, (kg/m2). Blood samples were obtained randomly from the Medical City Hospital in Baghdad and private infertility clinics. This study was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. The levels of anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results The results revealed a non-significant increase in anti-FSH antibody in patients (36.22±6.73) ng/ml, compared to controls (34.99±9.78 ng/ml), and a highly significant decrease in anti-LH antibody in patients (45.29±3.04 ng/ml), as compared to controls (69.16±10.90 ng/ml), (p<0.05). The fertility hormone, FSH showed a non-significant increase in non- healthy women (8.12±0.74 mIU/ml), in contrast to healthy women (7.35±0.62 mIU/ml) (p>0.05). While the LH hormone results was, in patients with PCOS (7.61±0.73 mIU/ml), as opposed to the control group it was (5.62±0.56 mIU/ml), the (p>0.05). Finally, the LH/FSH ratio showed a non- significant increase in both patients (1.161±0.37) and controls (0.7819±0.22) (p>0.05). Conclusion Women with PCOS showed increased LH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. However, a decrease in anti-LH antibody was accompanied by an increase of LH hormone and LH/FSH ratio.

                Background This policy brief examines the significant misalignment between the biological sleep patterns of students and the early start times of most educational institutions. Chronic sleep deprivation in this population is associated with detrimental effects on academic performance, mental and physical health, and interpersonal relationships. Policy and implications Compelling evidence indicates that early school schedules, dictated by historical and economic factors rather than student biology, force adolescents and young adults into a state of chronic sleep deficit. This has clear impacts, including impaired cognitive function, increased risks of obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and academic burnout. A systematic review of the literature confirms that delaying start times is an effective intervention to reduce these problems. Recommendations This brief recommends systematic changes, including later school and university start times, the integration of sleep hygiene education into curricula, limits on late-evening activities, and the use of flexible learning models. Supporting these structural changes, systems for monitoring student well-being and educating families are also advised. Conclusions Aligning educational schedules with biological sleep needs is a critical public health intervention. Comprehensive strategies that combine schedule adjustments, education, and support services offer the greatest benefit for student health and academic success. Future research should focus on socio-economic factors and local structural barriers to ensure equitable implementation.

                Background This study, entitled “University education: the way to fight poverty in Africa,” aimed to analyze the effect of university education on poverty. The research highlights the need for Congo, in particular, and sub-Saharan Africa, in general, to invest massively in university education to hope for the economic and social development so proclaimed. Indeed, the university education of individuals in a country is a critical factor in poverty reduction (Samo, 2022, Li et al., 2024). However, in sub-Saharan Africa, there needs to be more space for university education, focusing rather on primary education policies (UNESCO, 1997). Methods Data used are those from the 2011 Congolese household survey. The paper uses the decomposition of Foster Greer and Thorbecke’s (1984) poverty intensity index to show the differences in poverty by level of education attained among individuals with a higher level of education. The Full information maximum likelihood method using the Conditional mixed process (CMP) was preferred because it considers the variables’ causality by avoiding the endogeneity bias (Roodman, 2011). Results A Lorenz curve analysis shows that more education does not mean less income inequality. A multivariate explanatory analysis also shows the net effects of university education on poverty. The results obtained showed that university education helps reduce poverty. Conclusions The final analysis allows us to realize the gap between the political discourse regarding the desire to escape underdevelopment and the actions undertaken to do so, at least in terms of education. The results of this research, which are quite clear and relevant to the meaning and direction of this poverty-university education relationship, give rise to avenues of questioning on public policy in financing higher education practiced today by these sub-Saharan African countries.

<p><i>Phox2B</i> mutant mice and patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome exhibit ventilatory variability and complexity comparable to those of controls, suggesting that the RTN/pFRG nucleus is not required for brainstem central pattern generators to generate complex breathing. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Breathing is inherently variable due to the nonlinear dynamics of its brainstem neural control. In amphibians, a gill and a lung oscillator interact to produce breathing but the lung oscillator is necessary and sufficient to produce a mathematically complex behavior. In mammals, where the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) is considered homologous to the amphibian lung oscillator and the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) homologous to the amphibian gill oscillator, the origin of ventilatory complexity is not known. We address this question by characterizing ventilation variability in <i>Phox2b</i> mutant mice lacking the RTN/pFRG and human patients with <i>Phox2b</i> mutation-confirmed congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Ventilatory recordings were obtained from <i>Phox2b</i>
<sup>27</sup>
<i>
   <sup>ala/+</sup>
</i>—dying within hours after birth—and <i>Egr2<sup>cre/+</sup>
</i>; <i>Phox2b<sup>27ala/+</sup>
</i> mice—generally surviving until adulthood—and their wild-type (WT) littermates, during behavioral quiescence at various developmental stages. Human data were collected from CCHS patients and healthy controls during quiet wakefulness. Variability was assessed using the coefficient of variation, complexity using noise titration (noise limit, NL), and sensitivity to initial conditions using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). Mice from both mutant lineages exhibited greater variability at early developmental stages, which decreased with maturation in <i>Egr2<sup>cre</sup>
</i>
<sup>/+</sup>; <i>Phox2b<sup>27ala/+</sup>
</i> mice. NL was consistently higher in mutant mice than in WT, indicating preserved or even enhanced ventilatory complexity despite RTN/pFRG dysfunction. CO<sub>2</sub> reduced variability but did not affect complexity. In humans, no differences were observed between patients and controls for variability, NL, or LLE. Ventilatory complexity persists in mice lacking a functional RTN/pFRG and despite <i>Phox2b</i> mutations in humans, suggesting that the pontomedullary rhythm and pattern generators that include the preBötC may be its principal source. This supports the analogy between mammalian and amphibian rhythm generators.</p>

                <p>by Assaf Biran, Yaron E. Antebi</p>

Signaling pathways enable cells to coordinate collective behaviors by exchanging specific information. Many pathways utilize multiple ligand variants to activate the same intracellular signaling cascade, raising the question of how cells discriminate between these seemingly redundant signals. It has been shown that individual cells can discriminate between signals based on their induced level of activity, temporal dynamics or combinatorial effect. Here, we demonstrate that ligand discrimination could also emerge at the population level. Using mathematical models of ligand-receptor interactions, we examine how response heterogeneity at the population level can encode ligand identity. We introduce a local scaling metric to quantify how variation in pathway components affects the cellular response. Our results reveal that for pathways with dimeric receptors, and more significantly for heterodimeric receptors, biochemical parameters of the ligands control the resulting heterogeneity in the response of a population of cells. Furthermore, we show that the population-level heterogeneity encodes the enzymatic activity of the resulting receptor complex. This suggests a functional advantage for utilizing heterodimeric receptor complexes in pathways acting across a population of cells, such as the type I interferon pathway, which shows several of the characteristics of our model. This contrasts to juxtacrine pathways, such as Notch, that do not act at the population level and use a single component receptor. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which receptor architecture enables cells to encode ligand-specific information through population-level heterogeneity, offering insights into immune regulation, tissue development, and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Jakub Lála, Ayham Al-Saffar, Stefano Angioletti-Uberti</p>

Despite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics.

                <p>by Leonardo Agasso, Ivan Molineris, Michele Caselle</p>

Two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred about 500 million years ago and played a major role in the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Human genes derived from WGD are called “ohnologs”. Ohnologs are involved in fundamental biological processes and significantly contributed to the complexity of the human gene regulatory network. Given the central role of miRNAs in gene regulation, we investigated the contribution of ohnolog miRNAs (ohno-miRNAs) to the human gene regulatory network. We identified intragenic ohno-miRNAs as having higher retention rates compared to intragenic Small Scale Duplicated (SSD) miRNAs. Ohno-miRNAs also show high sequence similarity, a stronger tendency to regulate common target genes and are typically more expressed compared to miRNAs unrelated to WGD events. Analyzing the role of ohno-miRNAs in the human gene regulatory network, we showed that ohno-miRNAs are statistically overrepresented in specific network motifs commonly associated with redundancy and complexity, highlighting their central role in gene regulation.

Repeated waves of emerging variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics have highlighted the urge of collecting longitudinal genomic data and developing statistical methods based on time series analyses for detecting new threatening lineages and estimating their fitness early in time. Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages which is prone to induce delays and biases. More recently, several authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most existing methods are either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. The analysis of wastewater samples has recently been pointed out as a valuable complementary approach to clinical sample analysis, however the pooled nature of the data involves specific statistical challenges. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations in a consistent way with lineages B.1.160, Alpha, B.1.177, Beta, and with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods (which track specific mutations over time) with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations.

                <p>by Michael P. Mustri, Quqiming Duan, Samraat Pawar</p>

The generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology for modeling the dynamics emerging from species interactions within complex ecological communities. The GLV is also increasingly being used to infer species interactions and predict dynamics from empirical data on microbial communities, in particular. However, despite its widespread use, the accuracy of the GLV’s pairwise interaction structure in capturing the unseen dynamics of microbial consumer-resource interactions—arising from resource competition and metabolite exchanges—remains unclear. Here, we rigorously quantify how well the GLV can represent the dynamics of a general mathematical model that encapsulates key consumer-resource processes in microbial communities. We find that the GLV significantly misrepresents the feasibility, stability, and reactivity of microbial communities above a threshold biologically feasible level of consumer-resource coupling, because it omits higher-order nonlinear interactions. We show that the probability of the GLV making inaccurate predictions can be quantified by a simple, empirically accessible measure of timescale separation between consumers and resources. These insights advance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of resource-mediated microbial interactions and provide a method for gauging the GLV’s reliability across various empirical and theoretical scenarios.

Type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is often caused by variants in von Willebrand factor (VWF), including p.R1205H (“Vicenza mutation”), which accelerate VWF clearance via macrophage receptor LRP1 and impair platelet adhesion and activation. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain partially unclear. Here, we use integrative computational modeling (I-TASSER, HADDOCK2.4, and PRODIGY) to predict how p.R1205H/C/L/S variants alter VWF interaction with LRP1 and its platelet receptor GPIbα that binds to the A1 VWF domain. Our models reveal that R1205 acts as a structural hinge: its variants disrupt polar networks in VWF’s D3 domain, exposing neo-epitopes that enhance LRP1 binding (ΔΔG up to −5.3 kcal/mol) while destabilizing the A1 domain’s α1-β2 loop, reducing GPIbα affinity (≅30-fold for R1205L/C). These findings explain clinical observations, p.R1205H rapid clearance yet retained platelet adhesion, and establish R1205 as a dual-functional switch regulating VWF circulatory lifetime and hemostatic activity. This analytical procedure provides a template for predicting pathogenicity of VWF variants and designing targeted therapies for VWD.

                <p>by Esteban Dodero-Rojas, Angel Mendieta, Yao Fehlis, Nicholas Mayala, Vinícius G. Contessoto, José N. Onuchic</p>

Chromatin within the nucleus adopts complex three-dimensional structures that are crucial for gene regulation and cellular function. Recent studies have revealed the presence of distinct chromatin subcompartments beyond the traditional A/B compartments (eu- and hetero-chromatin), each exhibiting unique structural and functional properties. Here, we introduce TECSAS (Transformer of Epigenetics to Chromatin Structural AnnotationS), a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, designed to predict chromatin subcompartment annotations directly from epigenomic data. TECSAS leverages information from histone modifications, transcription factor binding profiles, and RNA-Seq data to decode the relationship between the biochemical composition of chromatin and its 3D structural behavior. TECSAS achieves high accuracy in predicting subcompartment annotations and reveals the influence of long-range epigenomic context on chromatin organization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model’s capability to predict the association of loci with nuclear bodies, such as the lamina, nucleoli, and speckles, providing insights into the role of these structures in shaping the 3D genome organization. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models for deciphering the complex interplay between epigenomic features and 3D genome organization, allowing us to better understand genome structure and function.

Diplonemids are among the most diverse and abundant protists in the deep ocean, have extremely complex and ancient cellular systems, and exhibit unique metabolic capacities. Despite this, we know very little about this major group of eukaryotes. To establish a model organism for comprehensive investigation, we performed subcellular proteomics on <i>Paradiplonema papillatum</i> and localized 4,870 proteins to 22 cellular compartments. We additionally confirmed the predicted location of several proteins by epitope tagging and fluorescence microscopy. To probe the metabolic capacities of <i>P. papillatum</i>, we explored the proteins predicted to the cell membrane compartment in our subcellular proteomics dataset. Our data revealed an accumulation of many carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CDZymes). Our predictions suggest that these CDZymes are exposed to extracellular space, supporting proposals that diplonemids may specialize in breaking down carbohydrates in plant and algal cell walls. Further exploration of carbohydrate metabolism revealed an evolutionary divergence in the function of glycosomes (modified peroxisomes) in diplonemids versus kinetoplastids. Our subcellular proteome provides a resource for future investigations into the unique cell biology of diplonemids.

                Background Hybrid nanofluids, consisting of two distinct nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid, are widely used in industries requiring enhanced heat and mass transfer, such as cooling systems and heat exchangers. These fluids improve thermal conductivity and fluid dynamics, leading to better heat management and energy efficiency. This study investigates the combined effects of non-linear thermal radiation, Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes, and other factors on the three-dimensional flow, heat, and mass transfer of a Williamson hybrid nanofluid. The flow occurs over a stretching porous sheet subjected to an external magnetic field, Joule heating, chemical reactions, and heat generation. Methods Copper (Cu) and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles are suspended in ethylene glycol (C₂C₆O₂) to form the hybrid nanofluid. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically with MATLAB’s bvp4c solver. The study examines various parameters, including stretching ratio, nanoparticle volume fraction, and relaxation times for concentration and thermal effects. Results are validated against existing literature. Results The findings reveal that a higher stretching ratio reduces velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, while also lowering skin friction and secondary velocity. Increasing nanoparticle volume fraction decreases velocity and temperature profiles but enhances skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers. Concentration profiles decline with higher concentration relaxation time, while temperature increases with longer thermal relaxation time. Conclusions In conclusion, Cu−Al₂O₃/C₂C₆O₂ hybrid nanofluids demonstrate superior heat and mass transfer capabilities compared to mono-nanofluids. The performance is significantly influenced by parameters such as nanoparticle volume fraction, relaxation times, and the stretching ratio, providing valuable insights for heat and mass transfer applications.

                Background Education is the key to stimulating the all-around development of any nation. Teachers should ensure that appropriate methods and strategies are employed to equip learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them to become economically and socially innovative. Thus, teachers should endeavor to understand how different factors, both internal and external to the school, may influence the academic achievement of learners to apply appropriate interventions for the best of the learners. Aim This study aimed to examine learners’ perceptions based on their gender of the influence of class participation in physics among secondary schools in Rukungiri District, Southwestern Uganda. Methods Quantitative research with a cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 355 ordinary-level secondary samples. Learners’ perceptions of class participation surveys were developed by the researchers and used to collect the data. Data were analyzed using means, standard deviations, and independent t-tests. Findings The findings revealed that Both males and females believed that improved class participation led to enhanced academic achievement. Learners’ perceptions did not vary significantly based on their gender. Recommendations The study recommends designing and implementing school-based gender-sensitive policies by relevant authorities, training teachers in interactive teaching methods, and creating initiatives to promote engaging and non-discriminatory interactive methods to positively boost learners’ class participation.
