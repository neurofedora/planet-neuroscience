                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are widely used to test the involvement of specific cortical regions in various domains such as cognition and emotion. Despite the capability of stimulation techniques to test causal directions, this approach has been only sparsely used to examine the cortical regulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and to test current models in this regard. In this preregistered (PROSPERO) systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate, based on meta-regression, whether NIBS represents an effective method for modulating HR and HRV measures, and to evaluate whether the ANS is modulated by cortical mechanisms affected by NIBS. Here we have adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. In a series of four meta-analyses, a total of 131 effect sizes from 35 sham-controlled trials were analyzed using robust variance estimation random-effects meta-regression technique. NIBS was found to effectively modulate HR and HRV with small to medium effect sizes. Moderator analyses yielded significant differences in effects between stimulation of distinct cortical areas. Our results show that NIBS is a promising tool to investigate the cortical regulation of ANS, which may add to the existing brain imaging and animal study literature. Future research is needed to identify further factors modulating the size of effects. As many of the studies reviewed were found to be at high risk of bias, we recommend that methods to reduce potential risk of bias be used in the design and conduct of future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain computation of cognitive versus acoustic errors in music</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have evidenced how the local prediction of physical stimulus features may affect the neural processing of incoming stimuli. Less known are the effects of cognitive priors on predictive processes, and how the brain computes local versus cognitive predictions and their errors. Here, we determined the differential brain mechanisms underlying prediction errors related to high-level, cognitive priors for melody (rhythm, contour) versus low-level, local acoustic priors (tuning, timbre). We measured with magnetoencephalography the mismatch negativity (MMN) prediction error signal in 104 adults having varying levels of musical expertise. We discovered that the brain regions involved in predictive processes for local priors were primary and secondary auditory cortex and insula, whereas cognitive brain regions such as cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices were recruited for melodic errors in cognitive priors. The involvement of higher-level brain regions for computing cognitive errors was enhanced in musicians, especially in cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyri, and supplementary motor area. Overall, the findings expand knowledge on whole-brain mechanisms of predictive processing and the related MMN generators, previously mainly confined to the auditory cortex, to a frontal network that strictly depends on the type of priors that are to be computed by the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Bisphenol A Exposure Induces Sensory Processing Deficits in Larval Zebrafish during Neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Because of their <I>ex utero</I> development, relatively simple nervous system, translucency, and availability of tools to investigate neural function, larval zebrafish are an exceptional model for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and the consequences of environmental toxins. Furthermore, early in development, zebrafish larvae easily absorb chemicals from water, a significant advantage over methods required to expose developing organisms to chemical agents <I>in utero</I>. Bisphenol A (BPA) and BPA analogs are ubiquitous environmental toxins with known molecular consequences. All humans have measurable quantities of BPA in their bodies. Most concerning, the level of BPA exposure is correlated with neurodevelopmental difficulties in people. Given the importance of understanding the health-related effects of this common toxin, we have exploited the experimental advantages of the larval zebrafish model system to investigate the behavioral and anatomic effects of BPA exposure. We discovered that BPA exposure early in development leads to deficits in the processing of sensory information, as indicated by BPA&rsquo;s effects on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and short-term habituation (STH) of the C-start reflex. We observed no changes in locomotion, thigmotaxis, and repetitive behaviors (circling). Despite changes in sensory processing, we detected no regional or whole-brain volume changes. Our results show that early BPA exposure can induce sensory processing deficits, as revealed by alterations in simple behaviors that are mediated by a well-defined neural circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Integration in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons Is Intact despite Deficits in GABAergic Transmission in the Scn1a Haploinsufficiency Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations of <I>SCN1A</I>, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.1, can cause epilepsy disorders such as Dravet syndrome (DS) that are comorbid with wide-ranging neurologic dysfunction. Many studies suggest that Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.1 haploinsufficiency causes forebrain GABAergic interneuron hypoexcitability, while pyramidal neuron physiology is mostly unaltered, and that this serves as a primary cell physiology phenotype linking mutation to disease. We hypothesized that deficits in inhibition would alter synaptic integration during activation of the hippocampal microcircuit, thus disrupting cellular information processing and leading to seizures and cognitive deficits. We tested this hypothesis using <I>ex vivo</I> whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in a heterozygous <I>Scn1a</I> knock-out mouse model and wild-type (WT) littermates, measuring responses to single and patterned synaptic stimulation and spontaneous synaptic activity. Overall, our experiments reveal a surprising normalcy of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic temporal integration in the hippocampus of <I>Scn1a</I> haploinsufficient mice. While miniature IPSCs and feedforward inhibition and were decreased, we did not identify a pattern or frequency of input that caused a failure of synaptic inhibition. We further show that reduced GABA release probability and subsequent reduced short-term depression may act to overcome deficits in inhibition normalizing input/output functions in the <I>Scn1a</I> haploinsufficient hippocampus. These experiments show that CA1 pyramidal neuron synaptic processing is surprisingly robust, even during decreased interneuron function, and more complex circuit activity is likely required to reveal altered function in the hippocampal microcircuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Slow Inactivation of Sodium Channels Contributes to Short-Term Adaptation in Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adaptation plays an important role in sensory systems as it dynamically modifies sensitivity to allow the detection of stimulus changes. The vomeronasal system controls many social behaviors in most mammals by detecting pheromones released by conspecifics. Stimuli activate a transduction cascade in vomeronasal neurons that leads to spiking activity. Whether and how these neurons adapt to stimuli is still debated and largely unknown. Here, we measured short-term adaptation performing current-clamp whole-cell recordings by using diluted urine as a stimulus, as it contains many pheromones. We measured spike frequency adaptation in response to repeated identical stimuli of 2&ndash;10 s duration that was dependent on the time interval between stimuli. Responses to paired current steps, bypassing the signal transduction cascade, also showed spike frequency adaptation. We found that voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels in VSNs undergo slow inactivation processes. Furthermore, recovery from slow inactivation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels occurs in several seconds, a time scale similar to that measured during paired-pulse adaptation protocols, suggesting that it partially contributes to short-term spike frequency adaptation. We conclude that vomeronasal neurons do exhibit a time-dependent short-term spike frequency adaptation to repeated natural stimuli and that slow inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels contributes to this form of adaptation. These findings not only increase our knowledge about adaptation in the vomeronasal system, but also raise the question of whether slow inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels may play a role in other sensory systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">High-Frequency Hearing Is Required to Compute a Topographic Map of Auditory Space in the Mouse Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A topographic map of auditory space is a feature found in the superior colliculus (SC) of many species, including CBA/CaJ mice. In this genetic background, high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences (ILDs) are used to compute spatial receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map along the azimuth. Unfortunately, C57BL/6 mice, a strain widely used for transgenic manipulation, display age-related hearing loss (AHL) because of an inbred mutation in the Cadherin 23 gene (<I>Cdh23</I>) that affects hair cell mechanotransduction. To overcome this problem, researchers have used young C57BL/6 mice in their studies, as they have been shown to have normal hearing thresholds. However, important details of the auditory response characteristics of the SC such as spectral responses and spatial localization, have not been characterized in young C57BL/6 mice. Here, we show that two- to four-month C57BL/6 mice lack neurons with frontal auditory RFs and therefore lack a topographic representation of auditory space in the SC. Analysis of the spectrotemporal RFs (STRFs) of the SC auditory neurons shows that C57BL/6 mouse SC neurons lack the ability to detect the high-frequency (&gt;40 kHz) spectral cues that are needed to compute frontal RFs. We also show that crossing C57BL/6 mice with CBA/CaJ mice or introducing one copy of the wild-type <I>Cdh23</I> to C57BL/6 mice rescues the high-frequency hearing deficit and improves the topographic map of auditory space. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency hearing in computing a topographic map of auditory space.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of tunnels in Œ±/Œ≤-hydrolase fold proteins‚ÄîWhat can we learn from studying epoxide hydrolases?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria Bz√≥wka, Karolina Mitusi≈Ñska, Agata Raczy≈Ñska, Tomasz Skalski, Aleksandra Samol, Weronika Bagrowska, Tomasz Magdziarz, Artur G√≥ra</p>

The evolutionary variability of a protein‚Äôs residues is highly dependent on protein region and function. Solvent-exposed residues, excluding those at interaction interfaces, are more variable than buried residues whereas active site residues are considered to be conserved. The abovementioned rules apply also to Œ±/Œ≤-hydrolase fold proteins‚Äîone of the oldest and the biggest superfamily of enzymes with buried active sites equipped with tunnels linking the reaction site with the exterior. We selected soluble epoxide hydrolases as representative of this family to conduct the first systematic study on the evolution of tunnels. We hypothesised that tunnels are lined by mostly conserved residues, and are equipped with a number of specific variable residues that are able to respond to evolutionary pressure. The hypothesis was confirmed, and we suggested a general and detailed way of the tunnels‚Äô evolution analysis based on entropy values calculated for tunnels‚Äô residues. We also found three different cases of entropy distribution among tunnel-lining residues. These observations can be applied for protein reengineering mimicking the natural evolution process. We propose a ‚Äòperforation‚Äô mechanism for new tunnels design <i>via</i> the merging of internal cavities or protein surface perforation. Based on the literature data, such a strategy of new tunnel design could significantly improve the enzyme‚Äôs performance and can be applied widely for enzymes with buried active sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An evolutionary conserved detoxification system for membrane lipid‚Äìderived peroxyl radicals in Gram-negative bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marwa Naguib, Nicol√°s Feldman, Paulina Zarodkiewicz, Holly Shropshire, Christina Biamis, Omar M. El-Halfawy, Julia McCain, Cl√©ment Dezanet, Jean-Luc D√©cout, Yin Chen, Gonzalo Cosa, Miguel A. Valvano</p>

How double-membraned Gram-negative bacteria overcome lipid peroxidation is virtually unknown. Bactericidal antibiotics and superoxide ion stress stimulate the transcription of the <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia bcnA</i> gene that encodes a secreted lipocalin. <i>bcnA</i> gene orthologs are conserved in bacteria and generally linked to a conserved upstream gene encoding a cytochrome b<sub>561</sub> membrane protein (herein named <i>lcoA</i>, lipocalin-associated cytochrome oxidase gene). Mutants in <i>bcnA</i>, <i>lcoA</i>, and in a gene encoding a conserved cytoplasmic aldehyde reductase (peroxidative stress-associated aldehyde reductase gene, <i>psrA</i>) display enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation. Compared to wild type, the levels of the peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) increase in the mutants upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of the bactericidal antibiotics polymyxin B and norfloxacin. Microscopy with lipid peroxidation‚Äìsensitive fluorescent probes shows that lipid peroxyl radicals accumulate at the bacterial cell poles and septum and peroxidation is associated with a redistribution of anionic phospholipids and reduced antimicrobial resistance in the mutants. We conclude that BcnA, LcoA, and PsrA are components of an evolutionary conserved, hitherto unrecognized peroxidation detoxification system that protects the bacterial cell envelope from lipid peroxyl radicals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metacommunity analyses show an increase in ecological specialisation throughout the Ediacaran period</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca Eden, Andrea Manica, Emily G. Mitchell</p>

The first animals appear during the late Ediacaran (572 to 541 Ma); an initial diversity increase was followed reduction in diversity, often interpreted as catastrophic mass extinction. We investigate Ediacaran ecosystem structure changes over this time period using the ‚ÄúElements of Metacommunity Structure‚Äù framework to assess whether this diversity reduction in the Nama was likely caused by an external mass extinction, or internal metacommunity restructuring. The oldest metacommunity was characterised by taxa with wide environmental tolerances, and limited specialisation or intertaxa associations. Structuring increased in the second oldest metacommunity, with groups of taxa sharing synchronous responses to environmental gradients, aggregating into distinct communities. This pattern strengthened in the youngest metacommunity, with communities showing strong environmental segregation and depth structure. Thus, metacommunity structure increased in complexity, with increased specialisation and resulting in competitive exclusion, not a catastrophic environmental disaster, leading to diversity loss in the terminal Ediacaran. These results reveal that the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics associated with Cambrian diversification were established in the Ediacaran.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sentiments based on objectivity and subjectivity with self-attention mechanisms [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The proliferation of digital commerce has allowed merchants to reach out to a wider customer base, prompting a study of customer reviews to gauge service and product quality through sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can be enhanced through subjectivity and objectivity classification with attention mechanisms. Methods: This research includes input corpora of contrasting levels of subjectivity and objectivity from different databases to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews, incorporating attention mechanisms at the aspect level. Three large corpora are chosen as the subjectivity and objectivity datasets, the Shopee user review dataset (ShopeeRD) for subjectivity, together with the Wikipedia English dataset (Wiki-en) and Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for objectivity. Word embeddings are created using Word2Vec with Skip-Gram. Then, a bidirectional LSTM with an attention layer (LSTM-ATT) imposed on word vectors. The performance of the model is evaluated and benchmarked against classification models of Logistics Regression (LR) and Linear SVC (L-SVC). Three models are trained with subjectivity (70% of ShopeeRD) and the objectivity (Wiki-en) embeddings, with ten-fold cross-validation. Next, the three models are evaluated against two datasets (IMDb and 20% of ShopeeRD). The experiments are based on benchmark comparisons, embedding comparison and model comparison with 70-10-20 train-validation-test splits. Data augmentation using AUG-BERT is performed and selected models incorporating AUG-BERT, are compared. Results: L-SVC scored the highest accuracy with 56.9% for objective embeddings (Wiki-en) while the LSTM-ATT scored 69.0% on subjective embeddings (ShopeeRD).¬† Improved performances were observed with data augmentation using AUG-BERT, where the LSTM-ATT+AUG-BERT model scored the highest accuracy at 60.0% for objective embeddings and 70.0% for subjective embeddings, compared to 57% (objective) and 69% (subjective) for L-SVC+AUG-BERT, and 56% (objective) and 68% (subjective) for L-SVC. Conclusions: Utilizing attention layers with subjectivity and objectivity notions has shown improvement to the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.

                The climate change issue has constituted an ongoing political struggle since the first formal international climate negotiations were initiated in 1992 in Rio. It is crucial to understand and solve this collective action problem to pave the road for an effective climate treaty in the future. Thus, we raise the following main research question: How should the political, economic and psychological barriers to an effective climate treaty and sustainable energy be modelled? This 'PEP Triangle' may be applied to better understand and thus improve the ongoing climate negotiations and sustainability. For example, the PEP Triangle may be used in green diplomacy and assist the European External Action Service (EEAS) in accomplishing an effective Paris Treaty.

                The search for novel drugs that efficiently eliminate prokaryotic pathogens is one of the most urgent health topics of our time. Robust evaluation methods for monitoring the antibiotic stress response in prokaryotes are therefore necessary for developing respective screening strategies. Besides advantages of common in vitro¬†techniques, there is a growing demand for in vivo¬†information based on imaging techniques that allow to screen antibiotic candidates in a dynamic manner. Gathering information from imaging data in a reproducible manner, robust data processing and analysis workflows demand advanced (semi-)automation and data management to increase reproducibility. Here we demonstrate a versatile and robust semi-automated image acquisition, processing and analysis workflow to investigate bacterial cell morphology in a quantitative manner. The presented workflow, A.D.I.C.T, covers aspects of experimental setup deployment, data acquisition and handling, image processing (e.g. ROI management, data transformation into binary images, background subtraction, filtering, projections) as well as statistical evaluation of the cellular stress response (e.g. shape measurement distributions, cell shape modeling, probability density evaluation of fluorescence imaging micrographs) towards antibiotic-induced stress, obtained from time-course experiments. The imaging workflow is based on regular brightfield images combined with live-cell imaging data gathered from bacteria, in our case from recombinant Shewanella¬†cells, which are processed as binary images. The model organism expresses target proteins relevant for membrane-biogenesis that are functionally fused to respective fluorescent proteins. Data processing and analysis are based on customized scripts using ImageJ2/FIJI, Celltool and R packages that can be easily reproduced and adapted by users. Summing up, our approach aims at supporting life-scientists to establish their own imaging-pipeline in order to exploit their data as versatile as possible and in a reproducible manner.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age¬†=¬†57‚Äâyears (¬±10‚Äâyears), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and Œ≤-amyloid (AŒ≤)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global AŒ≤-PET, and tau-PET signal in 5 regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with AŒ≤ and APOEŒµ4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.002), and global AŒ≤-PET (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. AŒ≤-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither AŒ≤-PET nor APOEŒµ4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20‚Äâyears earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in AŒ≤ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by AŒ≤ burden or APOEŒµ4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.

                Background: Obesity is¬†a¬†serious¬†condition¬†because it is associated with other chronic diseases¬†which¬†affect the quality of life. In addition to problems associated with diet and exercise, recent research has found¬†that¬†pesticide exposure might be another important risk factor.¬†The objective of this study was to determine the association between pesticide exposure and obesity¬†among farmers in Nakhon Sawan and¬†Phitsanulok¬†province, Thailand.¬† Methods: This study was a population-based cross-sectional study. Data on pesticide use and obesity prevalence from 20,295 farmers aged 20 years¬†and¬†older were collected using¬†an in-person interview¬†questionnaire. The association¬†was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for its potential confounding factors.¬† Results:¬†Obesity was found to be associated with pesticide use in the past. The risk of obesity was significantly predicted by types of pesticides, including insecticides¬†(OR¬†=¬†2.10, 95% CI 1.00-4.38), herbicides (OR¬†=¬†4.56, 95% CI 1.11-18.62), fungicides (OR¬†=¬†2.12, 95% CI 1.34-3.36), rodenticides (OR¬†=¬†2.55, 95% CI 1.61-4.05),¬†and molluscicides¬†(OR¬†=¬†3.40, 95% CI 2.15-5.40).¬†Among 35 surveyed individual pesticides, 22 were significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88 to OR = 8.30, 95% CI 2.54-27.19),¬†including herbicide butachlor, 15 insecticides (two carbamate insecticides,¬†five¬†organochlorine insecticides, and eight organophosphate insecticides), and¬†six¬†fungicides.¬† Conclusion:¬†This study found obesity in farmers in Nakhon Sawan and¬†Phitsanulok¬†province,¬†Thailand,¬†to be associated with¬†the¬†long-term¬†use of several types of pesticides. The issue should receive more public attention, and pesticide use should be strictly controlled.

                Background: All parts of the research community have an interest in understanding research impact whether that is around the pathways to impact, processes around impact, methods for measurement, describing impact and so on. This proof of concept study explored the relationship between research funding and research impact using the case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise in 2014 as a proxy for impact. Methods: The paper describes an approach to link the REF impact case studies with the underpinning research grants present in the Researchfish dataset, primarily using the publications captured in both datasets. Where possible the methodology utilised unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed ID‚Äôs, and where this was not possible the funding information within each publication was used. Results: Through this automated approach 21% of the non-redacted case studies could be linked to a specific research grant. Additional qualitative analysis was then done for unlinked REF impact case studies, which involved reading the document to identify additional information to make the linkage. This approach was taken on 100 REF impact case studies selected at random and resulted in only seven having no identifiable research grants funding associated. The linked research grants were analysed to identify characteristics that are more frequently associated with these grants, than non-linked ones. Conclusions: This analysis did point to some interesting observations such as the grant funding linked to REF impact case studies are more likely to be longer, higher financial value, have more publications and be more collaborative (amongst other characteristics). These findings should be used with caution at present and not be over interpreted, this is due to the sample size for this proof of concept study and some potential limitations on the data which were not addressed at this stage.

                Background: The importance of esthetics has escalated over the years. The purpose of any perioplastic surgery is to address gingival recession while ensuring predictable root coverage and a pleasing appearance. An array of surgical procedures have been recommended for the management of recession defects. The present study compares the clinical and patient related outcome measures of coronally advanced flap with chorion membrane and connective tissue graft in the management of multiple adjacent gingival recessions. Methods: The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial which included eight systemically healthy patients with an age range of 30-44 years with 36 labial/buccal, multiple adjacent, Cairo‚Äôs RT1 gingival recession defects, bilaterally. ¬†CAF+CM was performed on one side whereas CAF+CTG was performed on the other side. The two groups were compared clinically at three and six months postoperatively. Results: There was statistically significant decrease in recession depth, recession width, probing depth and clinical attachment level in both the groups from baseline to three and six months. However, intergroup comparisons revealed no statistically significant difference. At six months, both groups showed statistically significant improvements in keratinized tissue width and gingival thickness. The gingival thickness of the CAF+CM group increased significantly at three and six months. In terms of root coverage aesthetic score (RES), there was no significant difference observed between the two groups. In terms of patient reported outcome measures (PROMS), patients preferred the CAF+CM technique. Conclusion: Within the limits of the current study, the use of chorion membrane resulted in considerable root coverage and increased gingival thickness. Periodontal regeneration can be facilitated by the distinctive features of the chorion membrane. Coronally advanced flap plus chorion membrane is a novel approach for root coverage procedures.

                Background: More than 278 million cases and more than 5.4 million deaths due to coronavirus disease ¬†(COVID-19) were reported worldwide by the end of 2021. More than 34 million cases and more than 478,000 deaths have been reported in India. Epidemiologists, physicians and virologists are working on a number of conceptual, theoretical or mathematical modelling techniques in the battle against COVID-19.¬† Protocol: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive review of published mathematical models on COVID-19 in India and the concepts behind the development of mathematical models on COVID-19, including assumptions, modelling techniques, and data inputs. Initially, related keywords and their synonyms will be searched in the Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database managed by World Health Organisation (WHO). The database includes searches of bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE etc.,), preprints (MEDRXIV), manual searching, and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles. This database is updated daily (Monday through Friday). Two independent reviewers will be involved in screening the titles and abstracts at the first stage and full-texts at the second stage, and they will select studies as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies will be selected for their quality, transparency, and ethical aspects, using the Overview, Design concepts, Details (ODD) protocol and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) guidelines. Data will be extracted using standardized data extraction tools and will be synthesized for analysis. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Conclusions: This systematic review will be performed to critically examine relevant literature of existing mathematical models of COVID-19 in India. The findings will help to understand the concepts behind the development of mathematical models on COVID-19 conducted in India in terms of their assumptions, modelling techniques, and data inputs.

                Grant et¬†al. investigate the pathological, cellular, and functional differences in TB lung granulomas from macaques. The data reveal that most T¬†cells at early time points have low frequencies of transcription factor expression, while T¬†cells at later time points have increased expression of T-bet and a reduction in bacterial burden.

                The clinical development of phage therapy to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections requires understanding the dose-effect relationship. Delattre et¬†al. use a murine pneumonia model to longitudinally record phage-bacteria interactions. Mathematical modeling characterizes the synergy between phages and the host immune response. Predictions of treatment outcome could guide clinicians.

                Schembs et¬†al. investigate the role of primary cilia in human corticogenesis using INPP5E mutant cerebral organoids. The analyses show that overactive SHH signaling causes the formation of ventral telencephalic progenitors and neurons instead of cortical cells and imply important ciliary functions in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Loss of photoreceptors in the retina through damage or disease causes irreversible vision loss that could potentially be treated with transplanted stem-cell-derived photoreceptors. Rempel et¬†al. show that only very early-born stem-cell-derived PRs are capable of autonomous axon growth, which informs photoreceptor transplant strategies.

                Learning to make proper choices requires associating outcomes with the actions that preceded them. Parker et¬†al. record and optogenetically manipulate two input pathways to a key brain area associated with action-outcome learning, the nucleus accumbens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq revealed transit-amplifying thymic epithelial cells expressing autoimmune regulator</a></h4>

              
                Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are critical for self-tolerance induction in T cells via promiscuous expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which are controlled by the transcriptional regulator, AIRE. Whereas AIRE-expressing (Aire<sup>+</sup>) mTECs undergo constant turnover in the adult thymus, mechanisms underlying differentiation of postnatal mTECs remain to be discovered. Integrative analysis of single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) suggested the presence of proliferating mTECs with a specific chromatin structure, which express high levels of Aire and co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 (Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup>). Proliferating Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs detected using Fucci technology express a minimal number of Aire-dependent TSAs and are converted into quiescent Aire<sup>+</sup>CD80<sup>hi</sup> mTECs expressing high levels of TSAs after a transit amplification. These data provide evidence for the existence of transit-amplifying Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC precursors during the Aire<sup>+</sup>mTEC differentiation process of the postnatal thymus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-rapid eye movement sleep and wake neurophysiology in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Motivated by the potential of objective neurophysiological markers to index thalamocortical function in patients with severe psychiatric illnesses, we comprehensively characterized key non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parameters across multiple domains, their interdependencies, and their relationship to waking event-related potentials and symptom severity. In 72 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 58 controls, we confirmed a marked reduction in sleep spindle density in SCZ and extended these findings to show that fast and slow spindle properties were largely uncorrelated. We also describe a novel measure of slow oscillation and spindle interaction that was attenuated in SCZ. The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, statistically predicted disease status in the replication cohort. Although also altered in patients, auditory event-related potentials elicited during wake were unrelated to NREM metrics. Consistent with a growing literature implicating thalamocortical dysfunction in SCZ, our characterization identifies independent NREM and wake EEG biomarkers that may index distinct aspects of SCZ pathophysiology and point to multiple neural mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating these neurophysiological markers, individually or in combination, to guide efforts at treatment and prevention as well as identifying individuals most likely to benefit from specific interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparative multi-tissue profiling reveals extensive tissue-specificity in transcriptome reprogramming during thermal adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Thermal adaptation is an extensively used intervention for enhancing or suppressing thermogenic and mitochondrial activity in adipose tissues. As such, it has been suggested as a potential lifestyle intervention for body weight maintenance. While the metabolic consequences of thermal acclimation are not limited to the adipose tissues, the impact on the rest of the tissues in context of their gene expression profile remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the effects in a comparative multi-tissue RNA sequencing approach following exposure of mice to 10 ¬∞C, 22 ¬∞C, or 34 ¬∞C in a panel of organs consisting of spleen, bone marrow, spinal cord, brain, hypothalamus, ileum, liver, quadriceps, subcutaneous-, visceral- and brown adipose tissues. We highlight that transcriptional responses to temperature alterations exhibit a high degree of tissue-specificity both at the gene level and at GO enrichment gene sets, and show that the tissue-specificity is not directed by the distinct basic gene expression pattern exhibited by the various organs. Our study places the adaptation of individual tissues to different temperatures in a whole-organism framework and provides integrative transcriptional analysis necessary for understanding the temperature-mediated biological programming.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mitotically heritable, RNA polymerase II-independent H3K4 dimethylation stimulates INO1 transcriptional memory</a></h4>

              
                For some inducible genes, the rate and molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation depends on the prior experiences of the cell. This phenomenon, called <i>epigenetic transcriptional memory</i>, accelerates reactivation and requires both changes in chromatin structure and recruitment of poised RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter. Memory of inositol starvation in budding yeast involves a positive feedback loop between transcription factor-dependent interaction with the nuclear pore complex and histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). While H3K4me2 is essential for recruitment of RNAPII and faster reactivation, RNAPII is not required for H3K4me2. Unlike RNAPII-dependent H3K4me2 associated with transcription, RNAPII-independent H3K4me2 requires Nup100, SET3C, the Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex and, upon degradation of an essential transcription factor, is inherited through multiple cell cycles. The writer of this mark (COMPASS) physically interacts with the potential reader (SET3C), suggesting a molecular mechanism for the spreading and re-incorporation of H3K4me2 following DNA replication.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Typhoid toxin sorting and exocytic transport from Salmonella Typhi infected cells</a></h4>

              
                Typhoid toxin is an essential virulence factor for <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever in humans. This toxin has an unusual biology in that it is produced by <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi only when located within host cells. Once synthesized, the toxin is secreted to the lumen of the <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuole from where it is transported to the extracellular space by vesicle carrier intermediates. Here we report the identification of the typhoid toxin sorting receptor and components of the cellular machinery that packages the toxin into vesicle carriers, and exports it to the extracellular space. We found that the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor serves as typhoid toxin sorting receptor and that the coat protein COPII and the GTPase Sar1 mediate its packaging into vesicle carriers. Formation of the typhoid toxin carriers requires the specific environment of the <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi-containing vacuole, which is determined by the activities of specific effectors of its type III protein secretion systems. We also found that Rab11B and its interacting protein Rip11 control the intracellular transport of the typhoid toxin carriers, and the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23, and Syntaxin 4 their fusion to the plasma membrane. Typhoid toxin's cooption of specific cellular machinery for its transport to the extracellular space illustrates the remarkable adaptation of an exotoxin to exert its function in the context of an intracellular pathogen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aberrant causal inference and presence of a compensatory mechanism in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by a panoply of social, communicative, and sensory anomalies. As such, a central goal of computational psychiatry is to ascribe the heterogenous phenotypes observed in ASD to a limited set of canonical computations that may have gone awry in the disorder. Here, we posit causal inference - the process of inferring a causal structure linking sensory signals to hidden world causes - as one such computation. We show that audio-visual integration is intact in ASD and in line with optimal models of cue combination, yet multisensory behavior is anomalous in ASD because this group operates under an internal model favoring integration (vs. segregation). Paradoxically, during explicit reports of common cause across spatial or temporal disparities, individuals with ASD were less and not more likely to report common cause, particularly at small cue disparities. Formal model fitting revealed differences in both the prior probability for common cause (p-common) and choice biases, which are dissociable in implicit but not explicit causal inference tasks. Together, this pattern of results suggests (i) different internal models in attributing world causes to sensory signals in ASD relative to neurotypical individuals given identical sensory cues, and (ii) the presence of an explicit compensatory mechanism in ASD, with these individuals putatively having learned to compensate for their bias to integrate in explicit reports.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Residual force enhancement is affected more by quadriceps muscle length than stretch amplitude</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about how muscle length affects residual force enhancement (rFE) in humans. We therefore investigated rFE at short, long, and very long muscle lengths within the human quadriceps and patellar tendon (PT) using conventional dynamometry with motion capture (rFE<sub>TQ</sub>) and a new, non-invasive shear-wave tensiometry technique (rFE<sub>WS</sub>). Eleven healthy male participants performed submaximal (50% max.) EMG-matched fixed-end reference and stretch-hold contractions across these muscle lengths while muscle fascicle length changes of the vastus lateralis (VL) were captured using B-mode ultrasound. We found significant rFE<sub>TQ</sub> at long (7¬±5%) and very long (12¬±8%), but not short (2¬±5%) muscle lengths, whereas rFE<sub>WS</sub> was only significant at the very long (38¬±27%), but not short (8¬±12%) or long (6¬±10%) muscle lengths. We also found significant relationships between VL fascicle length and rFE<sub>TQ</sub> (<i>r</i>=0.63, <i>p</i>=.001) and rFE<sub>WS </sub>(<i>r</i>=0.52, <i>p</i>=.017), but relationships were not significant between VL fascicle stretch amplitude and rFE<sub>TQ</sub> (<i>r</i>=0.33, <i>p</i>=.126) or rFE<sub>WS </sub>(<i>r</i>=0.29, <i>p</i>=.201). PT shear-wave speed-angle relationships did not agree with estimated PT force-angle relationships, which indicates that estimating PT loads from shear-wave tensiometry might be inaccurate. We conclude that increasing muscle length rather than stretch amplitude contributes more to rFE during submaximal voluntary contractions of the human quadriceps.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Prefrontal-amygdalar oscillations related to social behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in the regulation of social behavior and associated with psychiatric diseases but their detailed neurophysiological mechanisms at a network level remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) while male mice engaged on social behavior. We found that in wild-type mice, both the dmPFC and BLA increased 4‚Äì7 Hz oscillation power and decreased 30‚Äì60 Hz power when they needed to attend to another target mouse. In mouse models with reduced social interactions, dmPFC 4‚Äì7 Hz power further increased especially when they exhibited social avoidance behavior. In contrast, dmPFC and BLA decreased 4‚Äì7 Hz power when wild-type mice socially approached a target mouse. Frequency-specific optogenetic manipulations replicating social approach-related LFP patterns restored social interaction behavior in socially deficient mice. These results demonstrate a neurophysiological substrate of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala related to social behavior and provide a unified pathophysiological understanding of neuronal population dynamics underlying social behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tonic nicotinic brake controls spike timing in striatal spiny projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                Striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) transform convergent excitatory corticostriatal inputs into an inhibitory signal that shapes basal ganglia output. This process is fine-tuned by striatal GABAergic interneurons (GINs), which receive overlapping cortical inputs and mediate rapid corticostriatal feedforward inhibition of SPNs. Adding another level of control, cholinergic interneurons (CINs), which are also vigorously activated by corticostriatal excitation, can disynaptically inhibit SPNs by activating Œ±4Œ≤2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on various GINs. Measurements of this disynaptic inhibitory pathway, however, indicate that it is too slow to compete with direct GIN-mediated feed-forward inhibition. Moreover, functional nAChRs are also present on populations of GINs that respond only weakly to phasic activation of CINs, such as parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PV-FSIs), making the overall role of nAChRs in shaping striatal synaptic integration unclear. Using acute striatal slices from mice we show that upon synchronous optogenetic activation of corticostriatal projections blockade of Œ±4Œ≤2 nAChRs shortened SPN spike latencies and increased postsynaptic depolarizations. The nAChR-dependent inhibition was mediated by downstream GABA release, and data suggest that the GABA source was not limited to GINs that respond strongly to phasic CIN activation. In particular, the observed decrease in spike latency caused by nAChR blockade was associated with a diminished frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in SPNs, a parallel hyperpolarization of PV-FSIs, and was occluded by pharmacologically preventing cortical activation of PV-FSIs. Taken together, we describe a role for tonic (as opposed to phasic) activation of nAChRs in striatal function. We conclude that tonic activation of nAChRs by CINs maintains a GABAergic brake on cortically-driven striatal output by 'priming' feedforward inhibition, a process that may shape SPN spike timing, striatal processing and synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Active site geometry stabilization of a presenilin homolog by the lipid bilayer promotes intramembrane proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Cleavage of membrane proteins in the lipid bilayer by intramembrane proteases is crucial for health and disease. Although different lipid environments can potently modulate their activity, how this is linked to their structural dynamics is unclear. Here we show that the carboxy-peptidase-like activity of the archaeal intramembrane protease PSH, a homolog of the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin/Œ≥-secretase is impaired in micelles and promoted in a lipid bilayer. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations revealed that important elements for substrate binding such as transmembrane domain 6a of PSH are more labile in micelles and stabilized in the lipid bilayer. Moreover, consistent with an enhanced interaction of PSH with a transition-state analog inhibitor, the bilayer promoted the formation of the enzyme¬¥s catalytic active site geometry. Our data indicate that the lipid environment of an intramembrane protease plays a critical role in structural stabilization and active site arrangement of the enzyme-substrate complex thereby promoting intramembrane proteolysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the IL-27 quaternary receptor signaling complex</a></h4>

              
                Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine that functions to constrain T cell-mediated inflammation and plays an important role in immune homeostasis. Binding of IL-27 to cell surface receptors IL-27RŒ± and gp130 results in activation of receptor-associated Janus Kinases and nuclear translocation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 transcription factors. Despite the emerging therapeutic importance of this cytokine axis in cancer and autoimmunity, a molecular blueprint of the IL-27 receptor signaling complex, and its relation to other gp130/IL-12 family cytokines, is currently unclear. We used cryogenic-electron microscopy to determine the quaternary structure of IL-27, composed of p28 and Ebi3 subunits, bound to receptors, IL-27RŒ± and gp130. The resulting 3.47 √Ö resolution structure revealed a three-site assembly mechanism nucleated by the central p28 subunit of the cytokine. The overall topology and molecular details of this binding are reminiscent of IL-6 but distinct from related heterodimeric cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. These results indicate distinct receptor assembly mechanisms used by heterodimeric cytokines with important consequences for targeted agonism and antagonism of IL-27 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Permian fish reveals widespread distribution of neopterygian-like jaw suspension</a></h4>

              
                The actinopterygian crown group (comprising all living ray-finned fishes) originated by the end of the Carboniferous. However, most late Paleozoic taxa are stem actinopterygians, and broadly resemble stratigraphically older taxa. The early Permian ‚Ä†<i>Brachydegma caelatum</i> is notable for its three-dimensional preservation and past phylogenetic interpretations as a nested member of the neopterygian crown. Here, we use computed microtomography to redescribe ‚Ä†<i>Brachydegma</i>, uncovering an unanticipated combination of primitive (e.g., aortic canal; immobile maxilla) and derived (e.g., differentiated occipital ossifications; posterior stem of parasphenoid; two accessory hyoidean ossifications; double jaw joint) dermal and endoskeletal features relative to most other Paleozoic actinopterygians. Some of these features were previously thought to be restricted to the neopterygian crown. The precise phylogenetic position of ‚Ä†<i>Brachydegma</i> is unclear, with placements either on the polypterid stem, or as an early-diverging stem neopterygian. However, our analyses decisively reject previous placements of ‚Ä†<i>Brachydegma</i> in the neopterygian crown. Critically, we demonstrate that key-endoskeletal components of the hyoid portion of the suspensorium of crown neopterygians appeared deeper in the tree than previously thought.

                New SARS-CoV-2 variants, breakthrough infections, waning immunity, and sub-optimal vaccination rates account for surges of hospitalizations and deaths. There is an urgent need for clinically valuable and generalizable triage tools assisting the allocation of hospital resources, particularly in resource-limited countries. We developed and validate CODOP, a machine learning-based tool for predicting the clinical outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CODOP was trained, tested and validated with six cohorts encompassing 29223 COVID-19 patients from more than 150 hospitals in Spain, the USA and Latin America during 2020-22. CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters commonly measured at hospital admission for reaching high discriminative ability up to nine days before clinical resolution (AUROC: 0¬∑90-0¬∑96), it is well calibrated, and it enables an effective dynamic risk stratification during hospitalization. Furthermore, CODOP maintains its predictive ability independently of the virus variant and the vaccination status. To reckon with the fluctuating pressure levels in hospitals during the pandemic, we offer two online CODOP calculators, suited for undertriage or overtriage scenarios, validated with a cohort of patients from 42 hospitals in three Latin American countries (78-100% sensitivity and 89-97% specificity). The performance of CODOP in heterogeneous and geographically disperse patient cohorts and the easiness of use strongly suggest its clinical utility, particularly in resource-limited countries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmentally determined intersectional genetic strategies to dissect adult somatosensory circuit function</a></h4>

              
                Improvements in the speed and cost of expression profiling of neuronal tissues offer an unprecedented opportunity to define ever finer subgroups of neurons for functional studies. In the spinal cord, single cell RNA sequencing studies support decades of work on spinal cord lineage studies offering a unique opportunity to probe adult function based on developmental lineage. While Cre/Flp recombinase intersectional strategies remain a powerful tool to manipulate spinal cord neurons, the field lacks genetic tools and strategies to restrict manipulations to the adult mouse spinal cord at the speed at which new tools develop. This study establishes a new workflow for intersectional mouse-viral strategies to dissect adult spinal cord circuit function based on developmental genetic lineage. To restrict manipulations to the spinal cord, we generate a brain-sparing Hoxb8FlpO mouse line restricting Flp-recombinase expression to caudal tissue. Recapitulating endogenous Hoxb8 gene expression, Flp-dependent reporter expression is present in the caudal embryo starting day 10.5. This expression restricts FlpO activity in the adult to the caudal brainstem and below. Hoxb8FlpO heterozygous and homozygous mice do not develop any of the sensory or locomotor phenotypes evident in Hoxb8 heterozygous or mutant animals, suggesting normal developmental function of the Hoxb8 gene and protein in Hoxb8FlpO mice. Comparing the variability of brain recombination to available caudal Cre and Flp lines we show that Hoxb8FlpO activity is not present in the brain above the caudal brainstem, independent of mouse genetic background. Lastly, we combine the Hoxb8FlpO mouse line with a dorsal horn developmental lineage Cre mouse line to express GFP in developmentally determined dorsal horn populations. Using GFP dependent Cre recombinase viruses, we target this lineage in the adult to show how this strategy can incorporate viral tools in a modular fashion. In summary, this new mouse line and viral approach provides a blueprint to dissect adult somatosensory circuit function using Cre/Flp genetic tools to target spinal cord interneurons based on genetic lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Machine Learning Predicts Treatment Response in Bipolar & Major Depressive Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) patients with complex symptoms presents a challenge to clinicians. Patients tend to spend more time in a depressive state than a manic state. In such complex cases, the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), which is not based on pathophysiology, can lead to misdiagnosis as major depressive disorder (MDD) and an imperfect or even harmful medication response. A biologically-based classification algorithm is needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Osuch et al. (2018) presented a kernel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the medication-class of response from new patient samples whose diagnoses were unclear. Here we also utilize the kernel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm but with a few novel contributions. We applied the robust, fully automated neuromark independent component analysis (ICA) framework to extract comparable features in a multi-dataset setting and learn a kernel function for support vector machine (SVM) on multiple feature subspaces. The neuromark framework successfully replicates the prior result with 95.45% accuracy (sensitivity 90.24%, specificity 92.3%). To further evaluate the generalizability of our approach, we incorporated two additional datasets comprising bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. We validated the trained algorithm on these datasets, resulting in a testing accuracy of up to 89% (sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.89) without using site or scanner harmonization techniques. We also translated the model to predict improvement scores of major depressive disorder (MDD) with up to 70% accuracy. This approach reveals some salient biological markers of medication-class of response within mood disorders.

Such tunable synapses are crucial for the denoising function of the early visual system. However, it is unclear that how the plastic gap junction network processes unknown noise, specifically how this process works synergistically with the brain's higher visual centers. Inspired by the electrically coupled photoreceptors, we develop a computational model of the gap junction filter (G-filter). We show that G-filter is an effective blind denoiser that converts different noise distributions into a similar form. Next, since deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) functionally reflect some intrinsic features of the visual cortex, we combine G-filter with DCNNs as retina and ventral visual pathways to investigate the relationship between retinal denoising processing and the brain's high-level functions. In the image denoising and reconstruction task, G-filter dramatically improve the classic deep denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN)'s ability to process blind noise. Further, we find that the gap junction strength of the G-filter modulates the receptive field of DnCNN's output neurons by the Integrated Gradients method. At last, in the image classification task, G-filter strengthens the defense of state-of-the-arts DCNNs (ResNet50, VGG19 and InceptionV3) against blind noise attacks, far exceeding human performance when noise is large. Our results indicate G-filter significantly enhance DCNNs' ability on various blind denoising tasks, implying an essential role for retina gap junction networks in high-level visual processing.

                Dysregulated neuronal excitability is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We sought to investigate how functional changes to the axon initial segment (AIS), the site of action potential generation, could impact neuronal excitability in a human iPSC model of ALS. We found that early (6-week) ALS-related TDP-43-G298S motor neurons showed an increase in the length of the AIS, relative to CRISPR-corrected controls. This was linked to neuronal hyperexcitability and increased spontaneous contractions of human iPSC-myofibers in compartmentalised neuromuscular co-cultures. In contrast late (10-week) TDP-43-G298S motor neurons showed reduced AIS length and hypoexcitability. At a molecular level aberrant expression of the AIS master scaffolding protein Ankyrin-G, and the AIS-specific voltage-gated ion channels SCN1A (Nav1.1) and SCN8A (Nav1.6) mirrored these dynamic changes in excitability. Finally, at all stages, TDP-43-G298S motor neurons showed compromised activity-dependent plasticity of the AIS, further contributing to abnormal excitability. Our results point toward the AIS as an important subcellular target driving changes to neuronal excitability in ALS.

                Resolving fundamental molecular and functional processes underlying human synaptic development is crucial for understanding normal brain function as well as dysfunction in disease. Based upon increasing evidence of species divergent features of brain cell types, coupled with emerging studies of complex human disease genetics, we developed the first automated and quantitative high-content synaptic phenotyping platform using human neurons and astrocytes. To establish the robustness of our platform, we screened the effects of 376 small molecules on presynaptic density, neurite outgrowth and cell viability, validating six small molecules which specifically enhanced human presynaptic density in vitro. Astrocytes were essential for mediating the effects of all six small molecules, underscoring the relevance of non-cell autonomous factors in synapse assembly and their importance in synaptic screening applications. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors emerged as the most prominent hit class and global transcriptional analyses using multiple BET inhibitors confirmed upregulation of synaptic gene expression programs. Through these analyses, we demonstrate the robustness of our automated screening platform for identifying potent synaptic modulators, which can be further leveraged for scaled analyses of human synaptic mechanisms and drug discovery efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Action initiation and punishment learning differ from childhood to adolescence while reward learning remains stable</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical and empirical accounts suggest that adolescence is associated with heightened reward learning and impulsivity. Experimental tasks and computational models that can dissociate reward learning from the tendency to initiate actions impulsively (action initiation bias) are thus critical to characterise the mechanisms that drive developmental differences. However, existing work has rarely quantified both learning ability and action initiation, or it has tested small samples. Here, using computational modelling of a learning task collected from a large sample (N=742, 9-18 years, 11 countries), we tested differences in reward and punishment learning and action initiation from childhood to adolescence. Computational modelling revealed that whilst punishment learning rates increased with age, reward learning remained stable. In parallel, action initiation biases decreased with age. Results were similar when considering pubertal stage instead of chronological age. We conclude that heightened reward responsivity in adolescence can reflect differences in action initiation rather than enhanced reward learning.

                Optical imaging is a powerful tool to visualise and measure neuronal activity. However, due to the size and opacity of vertebrate brains it has until now been impossible to simultaneously image neuronal circuits at cellular resolution across the entire adult brain. This is true even for the smallest known vertebrate brain in the teleost Danionella, which is still too large for existing volumetric imaging approaches. Here we introduce image transfer oblique plane microscopy, which uses a new optical refocusing solution via a custom fibre-optical face-plate, enabling a large field-of-view of up to 4 mm3 at a volume rate of 1 Hz. We demonstrate the power of this method with the first brain-wide recording of neuronal activity in an adult vertebrate.

	<p>Neuropathic pain is a challenging complaint for patients and clinicians since there are no effective agents available to get satisfactory outcomes even though the pharmacological agents target reasonable pathophysiological mechanisms. This may indicate that other aspects in these mechanisms should be unveiled to comprehend the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and thus find more effective treatments. Therefore, in the present study, several mechanisms are chosen to be reconsidered in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain from a quantum mechanical perspective. The mathematical model of the ions quantum tunneling model is used to provide quantum aspects in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Three major pathophysiological mechanisms are revisited in the context of the quantum tunneling model. These include: (1) the depolarized membrane potential of neurons; (2) the cross-talk or the ephaptic coupling between the neurons; and (3) the spontaneous neuronal activity and the emergence of ectopic action potentials. We will show mathematically that the quantum tunneling model can predict the occurrence of neuronal membrane depolarization attributed to the quantum tunneling current of sodium ions. Moreover, the probability of inducing an ectopic action potential in the axons of neurons will be calculated and will be shown to be significant and influential. These ectopic action potentials are generated due to the formation of quantum synapses which are assumed to be the mechanism behind the ephaptic transmission. Furthermore, the spontaneous neuronal activity and the emergence of ectopic action potentials independently from any adjacent stimulated neurons are predicted to occur according to the quantum tunneling model. All these quantum mechanical aspects contribute to the overall hyperexcitability of the neurons and to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Additionally, providing a new perspective in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain may improve our understanding of how the neuropathic pain is generated and maintained and may offer new effective agents that can improve the overall clinical outcomes of the patients.</p>

	<p>Bow Hunter&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (BHS), also known as rotational vertebral artery occlusion (VAO), is a rare entity in which vertebral artery is reversibly compressed due to rotation or extension of the head, causing vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Because of VAO, BHS should be considered as a possible life-threatening condition. Diverse aetiologies of BHS may trigger a broad spectrum of non-specific symptoms and may result in frequent misdiagnosis of this disorder in daily clinical practice. Herein, we present a case of BHS caused by previously non-described vascular aetiology.</p>

	<p>Background: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a third-generation cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has proved its efficacy amidst various mental disorders. A growing body of studies has shown that ACT can improve obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity in recent years. To assess the effect of ACT on OCD, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a basis for therapists to use different psychological dimensions of ACT for OCD. Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO Host, and literature references were searched until May 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other study designs assessing the effect of ACT among adults suffering from OCD were examined. Results: Fourteen studies, including 413 participants, published between 2010 and 2021 were identified. ACT made statistically significant progress in the Yale&amp;amp;ndash;Brown Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) compared with control conditions. Conclusion: After reviewing all the ACT studies, we acknowledge the plausibility of ACT in treating OCD and improving its symptoms for the clinical population. ACT can also be an adjunct therapy for other well-established treatments. It also favors targeting psychological inflexibility. Further well-controlled and high-quality RCTs are required for a better conclusion in further studies.</p>

	<p>Depression is considered a neuropsychic disease that has global prevalence and is associated with disability. The pathophysiology of depression is not well understood; however, emerging evidence has indicated that neuroinflammation could contribute to developing depression symptoms. One of the factors that have a role in the development of neuroinflammation is the renin&amp;amp;ndash;angiotensin system. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to determine the antidepressant-like effects of Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior in mice, glial cell activation, and the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the prefrontal cortex. For behavioral studies, the open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT) were used. Inflammatory markers were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LPS administration (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) sufficiently reduced the number of crossings in OFT, whereas Aliskiren pretreatment (10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the LPS effect for two hours after LPS injection. The treatments did not show effects on locomotor activity in OFT 24 h after LPS administration. LPS increased the immobility time in TST and FST or reduced sucrose consumption in SPT after 24 h. Aliskiren reversed the effects induced by LPS in TST, FST, and SPT. CD11 b mRNA, a microglial marker, GFAP mRNA, an astroglial marker, and proinflammatory cytokines genes (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, and IL-6) were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex in LPS exposed animals. However, Aliskiren reduced LPS-induced inflammatory genes in the prefrontal cortex. Hence, the outcomes conclude that Aliskiren prevents depressive illness associated with neuroinflammation in humans.</p>

                Doublets are prevalent in single-cell sequencing data and can lead to artifactual findings. A number of strategies have therefore been proposed to detect them. Building on the strengths of existing approaches, we developed scDblFinder, a fast, flexible and accurate Bioconductor-based doublet detection method. Here we present the method, justify its design choices, demonstrate its performance on both single-cell RNA and accessibility (ATAC) sequencing data, and provide some observations on doublet formation, detection, and enrichment analysis. Even in complex datasets, scDblFinder can accurately identify most heterotypic doublets, and was already found by an independent benchmark to outcompete alternatives.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Marine plant mediated green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using mangrove Rhizophora stylosa: Effect of variable process and their antibacterial activity [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:¬†Most natural plants used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are limited to marine plants. To carry out applications, colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNps) should have appropriate properties such as homogeneous shapes, small and narrow particle size distribution, and long time stability. This study aims to determine the effects of a variable process of AgNps mediated mangrove Rhizophora stylosa (RS) leaf extract, and antibacterial activity.¬† Methods: Synthesis of AgNps was carried out by stirring silver nitrate solution with aqueous extract. The characterization of AgNps was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) zetasizer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Evaluation of antibacterial activity was carried out on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Reaction conditions such as the concentration of metal ions (0.001 M, 0.005 M, and 0.01 M), extracts (1%, 3%, and 5% v/v), and the reaction time on the size and stability of nanoparticles were also explored. Results: The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption of colloidal AgNps in a wavelength range of 403‚Äì443 nm. ¬†TEM analysis showed that as-synthesized AgNps were spherical in shape with a size range of 5‚Äì87 nm. The use of 0.001 M and 0.005 M of Ag+ resulted in a smaller diameter than the synthesized AgNps, using 0.01 M Ag+, in the same extract concentration. The range of zeta potential was -24.9 mV to -27.7 mV. The as-synthesized AgNps were stable for more than one month. The XRD analysis showed four peaks, which were attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. The results of the silver nanoparticles synthesis showed good activity on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone between 4.1‚Äì7.2 mm. Conclusions: The AgNps synthesized with RS leaf extract, which is a reducing agent, showed good potential as an antibacterial component.

                In October 2021, 59 scientists from 14 countries and 13 U.S. states collaborated virtually in the Third Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNANexus Structural Variation hackathon. The goal of the hackathon was to advance research on structural variants (SVs) by prototyping and iterating on open-source software. This led to nine hackathon projects focused on diverse genomics research interests, including various SV discovery and genotyping methods, SV sequence reconstruction, and clinically relevant structural variation, including SARS-CoV-2 variants. Repositories for the projects that participated in the hackathon are available at https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics.

                Background: The study‚Äôs purpose was to identify associations between mental health risk, suicide attempts, and family function. ¬† Methods: A correlational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was carried out in a group of adolescents in the last grade of secondary school to establish the association between mental health risk, suicide attempt, and family functionality. The instruments used were the self-report questionnaire, the suicide risk assessment scale, and the family APGAR. Data analysis was performed using the artificial intelligence algorithm (gower clustering).¬† Results: 246 adolescents responded to the three instruments, which made it possible to select those with correlations of sensitive interest and, based on these, an intervention plan. Psychological distress was found in 28%, psychotic symptoms in 85%, and problematic alcohol use in 9%. Good family functioning was identified in 34% and some type of family dysfunction in 66%. In terms of suicide risk, there was a low suicide risk of 74%, 24% medium risk, and 2% high risk. It could be shown that there is a correlation in a group of 15% of the respondents.¬† Conclusions: The risk of suffering mental health deterioration and the suicide risk, during this pandemic period, seems to be related to family functionality.

                Background: The skin is the largest organ of the human body, around 15% of the body weight consisting of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous. The skin's primary function is to protect our body from external factors that can harm the body by forming a protective barrier that covers the body. This review aims to provide insights related to wound-healing mechanisms of several plants in HaCat cells. Methods: The literature study method used, both from primary and secondary libraries. The library search was conducted using online-based library search instruments from 2009 to 2021, such as NCBI-PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: The wound-healing mechanism includes processes that restore skin integrity through four stages: hemostasis, inflammation, multiplication, and remodeling. Many plants have been studied to have activity in wound-healing by various mechanisms. Conclusions: Therefore, it is essential to research wound-healing mechanisms to find treatments sourced from natural compounds.

                Background: Several studies have shown that active compounds of Asclepias subulata (cardenolides) have antiproliferative effect on human cancer cells. Cardenolides isolated from A. subulata can be used as active chemical markers to elaborate phytopharmaceutical preparations. To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a standardized extract of the aerial parts, based on Asclepias subulata cardenolides. Methods: Four standardized extracts were prepared by HPLC-DAD depending on the concentration of calotropin and the antiproliferative activity was measured for the MTT assay, on the A549, MCF-7, HeLa, PC3 and ARPE cell lines. The concentrations of calotropin used for the standardization of the extracts were 10, 7.6, 5 and 1 mg/dL. Results: Standardization of the A. subulata extract based on calotropin at 7.6 mg/g dry weight was achieved and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated over A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, obtaining proliferation percentages of 3.8 to 13.4%. Conclusions: The standardized extracts of A. subulata at different concentrations of calotropin showed antiproliferative activity against all the cell lines evaluated. The greatest effect was observed against the HeLa cell line.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correlations from structure and phylogeny combine constructively in the inference of protein partners from sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andonis Gerardos, Nicola Dietler, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Inferring protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important task in computational biology. Recent methods based on Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) or Mutual Information (MI) allow to find interaction partners among paralogs of two protein families. Does successful inference mainly rely on correlations from structural contacts or from phylogeny, or both? Do these two types of signal combine constructively or hinder each other? To address these questions, we generate and analyze synthetic data produced using a minimal model that allows us to control the amounts of structural constraints and phylogeny. We show that correlations from these two sources combine constructively to increase the performance of partner inference by DCA or MI. Furthermore, signal from phylogeny can rescue partner inference when signal from contacts becomes less informative, including in the realistic case where inter-protein contacts are restricted to a small subset of sites. We also demonstrate that DCA-inferred couplings between non-contact pairs of sites improve partner inference in the presence of strong phylogeny, while deteriorating it otherwise. Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny. In a natural data set, as well as in realistic synthetic data based on it, we find that non-contact pairs of sites contribute positively to partner inference performance, and that restricting to them preserves performance, evidencing an important role of phylogeny.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Appropriate relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions minimizes the risk of a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 infections in spite of the Delta variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wadim Koslow, Martin J. K√ºhn, Sebastian Binder, Margrit Klitz, Daniel Abele, Achim Basermann, Michael Meyer-Hermann</p>

We analyze the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) under an increasing number of vaccinations in Germany. For the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we employ a SIR-type model that accounts for age-dependence and includes realistic contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of NPIs occurs on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. We account for spatial heterogeneity and commuting activities in between regions in Germany, and the testing of commuters is considered as a further NPI. We include the ongoing vaccination process and analyze the effect of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, which is considered to be 40%‚Äì60% more infectious then the currently dominant B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. We explore different opening scenarios under the ongoing vaccination process by assuming that local restrictions are either lifted in early July or August with or without continued wearing of masks and testing. Our results indicate that we can counteract the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 despite the Delta variant with appropriate timing for the relaxation of NPIs. In all cases, however, school children are hit the hardest.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Annotating functional effects of non-coding variants in neuropsychiatric cell types by deep transfer learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Boqiao Lai, Sheng Qian, Hanwei Zhang, Siwei Zhang, Alena Kozlova, Junbao Duan, Jinbo Xu, Xin He</p>

Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of loci associated with neuropsychiatric traits, however, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these loci remains difficult. To help prioritize causal variants and interpret their functions, computational methods have been developed to predict regulatory effects of non-coding variants. An emerging approach to variant annotation is deep learning models that predict regulatory functions from DNA sequences alone. While such models have been trained on large publicly available dataset such as ENCODE, neuropsychiatric trait-related cell types are under-represented in these datasets, thus there is an urgent need of better tools and resources to annotate variant functions in such cellular contexts. To fill this gap, we collected a large collection of neurodevelopment-related cell/tissue types, and trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet) using such data. Furthermore, our model, called MetaChrom, borrows information from public epigenomic consortium to improve the accuracy via transfer learning. We show that MetaChrom is substantially better in predicting experimentally determined chromatin accessibility variants than popular variant annotation tools such as CADD and delta-SVM. By combining GWAS data with MetaChrom predictions, we prioritized 31 SNPs for Schizophrenia, suggesting potential risk genes and the biological contexts where they act. In summary, MetaChrom provides functional annotations of any DNA variants in the neuro-development context and the general method of MetaChrom can also be extended to other disease-related cell or tissue types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicting knee adduction moment response to gait retraining with minimal clinical data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nataliya Rokhmanova, Katherine J. Kuchenbecker, Peter B. Shull, Reed Ferber, Eni Halilaj</p>

Knee osteoarthritis is a progressive disease mediated by high joint loads. Foot progression angle modifications that reduce the knee adduction moment (KAM), a surrogate of knee loading, have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating pain and improving function. Although changes to the foot progression angle are overall beneficial, KAM reductions are not consistent across patients. Moreover, customized interventions are time-consuming and require instrumentation not commonly available in the clinic. We present a regression model that uses minimal clinical data‚Äîa set of six features easily obtained in the clinic‚Äîto predict the extent of first peak KAM reduction after toe-in gait retraining. For such a model to generalize, the training data must be large and variable. Given the lack of large public datasets that contain different gaits for the same patient, we generated this dataset synthetically. Insights learned from a ground-truth dataset with both baseline and toe-in gait trials (N = 12) enabled the creation of a large (N = 138) synthetic dataset for training the predictive model. On a test set of data collected by a separate research group (N = 15), the first peak KAM reduction was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.134% body weight * height (%BW*HT). This error is smaller than the standard deviation of the first peak KAM during baseline walking averaged across test subjects (0.306%BW*HT). This work demonstrates the feasibility of training predictive models with synthetic data and provides clinicians with a new tool to predict the outcome of patient-specific gait retraining without requiring gait lab instrumentation.

Despite multiple spillover events and short chains of transmission on at least 4 continents, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has never triggered a pandemic. By contrast, its relative, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has, despite apparently little, if any, previous circulation in humans. Resolving the unsolved mystery of the failure of MERS-CoV to trigger a pandemic could help inform how we understand the pandemic potential of pathogens, and probing it underscores a need for a more holistic understanding of the ways in which viral genetic changes scale up to population-level transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The structural context of posttranslational modifications at a proteome-wide scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Isabell Bludau, Sander Willems, Wen-Feng Zeng, Maximilian T. Strauss, Fynn M. Hansen, Maria C. Tanzer, Ozge Karayel, Brenda A. Schulman, Matthias Mann</p>

The recent revolution in computational protein structure prediction provides folding models for entire proteomes, which can now be integrated with large-scale experimental data. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has identified and quantified tens of thousands of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), most of them of uncertain functional relevance. In this study, we determine the structural context of these PTMs and investigate how this information can be leveraged to pinpoint potential regulatory sites. Our analysis uncovers global patterns of PTM occurrence across folded and intrinsically disordered regions. We found that this information can help to distinguish regulatory PTMs from those marking improperly folded proteins. Interestingly, the human proteome contains thousands of proteins that have large folded domains linked by short, disordered regions that are strongly enriched in regulatory phosphosites. These include well-known kinase activation loops that induce protein conformational changes upon phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism appears to be widespread in kinases but also occurs in other protein families such as solute carriers. It is not limited to phosphorylation but includes ubiquitination and acetylation sites as well. Furthermore, we performed three-dimensional proximity analysis, which revealed examples of spatial coregulation of different PTM types and potential PTM crosstalk. To enable the community to build upon these first analyses, we provide tools for 3D visualization of proteomics data and PTMs as well as python libraries for data accession and processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Testosterone level correlates significantly with luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrinological problem among women in the reproductive age, is characterized by chronic ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and elevated luteinizing hormone: follicle stimulating hormone (LH-FSH) ratio. The goal of this study was to examine if the blood LH-FSH ratio and total testosterone (TT) levels in Sudanese women with PCOS were linked. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 300 women with confirmed PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria. ¬†PCOS women mean (standard deviation): age 29.1(5.8) years; body mass index (BMI) 27.9¬±4.6 kg/m2. Each participant underwent a clinical history, physical examination, and ovaries ultrasonogram. ¬†ASYS Expert Plus Microplate was used to quantify serum LH, FSH, and TT levels in fasting blood specimen drawn during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle of women with PCOS. Results: More than two-thirds of the participants (71.0%) had an aberrant LH-FSH ratio (cut-off>1.0), and 58.3% had hyperandrogenemia (TT>109.5 ng/dL). Hyperandrogenemic women had significantly increased LH-FSH ratio (P= 0.000). The LH-FSH ratio and serum TT were significantly positive correlated (r= 0.329, P= 0.000). Overall, 52.0% of women with PCOS exhibited menstrual cycle irregularity, and 59.0 % had a positive family history of PCOS. On logistic regression analysis, the LH-FSH ratio (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.308 (1.698- 3.139, P= 0.000) was found to be positively related to hyperandrogenemia independently. Furthermore, when the LH-FSH ratio is greater than one, hyperandrogenemia can be distinguished from normoandrogenemia, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.726, P= 0.000, 95% CI: (0.668-0.785) with a serum TT threshold of 109.5 ng/dL (sensitivity 70.0%, specificity 77.1%). Conclusions: In Sudanese women with PCOS, the serum LH-FSH ratio and TT have a strong relationship. Furthermore, LH-FSH ratio of greater than one can be used to distinguish between hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS women.

                Background: This review aims to map the evidence on the effectiveness of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications and identify research gaps in key outcomes and CAMs. Methods: We followed the Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines to undertake this scoping review. We carried out a comprehensive search from inception to March 2020 in electronic databases and registers. Forward and backward citations of included studies were also searched. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies with intervention and control arm were mapped based on the effectiveness of various CAM (Yoga, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Siddha, Naturopathy, Unani, and Sowa-rigpa) on outcomes among individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome, T2DM with and without any comorbidities. Results: A total of 249 studies were included after screening 3798 citations. Most of the included studies were conducted in India and Iran. Most frequently studied CAM interventions include Yoga, Ayurveda, and herbal products as compared to other CAM therapies. Conclusion: Although we identified a lot of literature on the effectiveness of CAMs for T2DM, there is a lack of standardization of preparation of these medicines and the interventional modalities. To validate the potential benefits of CAM, robust research with high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews are needed to bridge the gap of evidence in CAM therapies. Future investments for research in CAM may focus on assessing the quality of existing trials and finding out an optimal dose, frequency, and duration of CAM, both as an alternative and complementary approach.

                Background:¬†Cancer is a comorbidity that leads to progressive worsening of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with increased mortality. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to yield evidence of adverse outcomes of Covid-19 in gynecologic cancer. Methods:¬†Searches through PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and medRxiv to find¬†articles on the outcome of gynecologic cancer with Covid-19 (24 July 2021‚Äì19 February 2022).¬†The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and random-effects model were presented. Results:¬†We accepted 51 studies (a total of 1991 gynecologic cancer patients with Covid-19). Covid-19 infection cases were lower in gynecologic cancer vs hematologic cancer (OR 0.71, CI 0.56-0.90,¬†p¬†0.005). Severe Covid-19 infection and¬†death were lower in gynecologic cancer vs lung and¬†hematologic cancer (OR 0.36, CI 0.16-0.80,¬†p¬†0.01), (OR 0.52, CI 0.44-0.62,¬†p¬†<0.0001), (OR 0.26, CI 0.10-0.67¬†p¬†0.005), (OR 0.63, CI 0.47-0.83,¬†p¬†0.001) respectively. Increased Covid death was seen in gynecologic cancer vs population with breast cancer, non-Covid cancer, and non-cancer Covid (OR 1.50, CI 1.20-1.88,¬†p¬†0.0004), (OR 11.83, CI 8.20-17.07,¬†p¬†<0.0001), (OR 2.98, CI 2.23-3.98,¬†p¬†<0.0001) respectively. ¬†¬† Conclusion:¬†Gynecologic cancer has higher Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to non-cancer, breast cancer, non-metastatic, and Covid-19 negative population. Gynecologic cancer has fewer Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to other cancer types, lung cancer, and hematologic cancer. These findings may aid health policies and services during the ongoing global pandemic. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42021256557 (22/05/21)

                Background: Action observation training (AOT) is used for lower limb (LL) stroke rehabilitation in subacute and chronic stages, but concise information regarding the types of activities to be used and the feasibility of administration in the acute stroke population is unknown. The aim of this study was to develop and validate videos of appropriate activities for LL AOT and test administrative feasibility in acute stroke.¬†¬† Method: A video inventory of LL activities was created after a literature survey and expert scrutiny. Five stroke rehabilitation experts validated the videos per domains of relevance, comprehension, clarity, camera position and brightness. LL AOT was then tested on ten individuals with acute stroke for uncovering barriers for clinical use in a feasibility study. Participants watched the activities and attempted imitation of the same. Determination of administrative feasibility was undertaken via participant interviews.¬†¬† Results: Suitable LL activities for stroke rehabilitation were identified. Content validation of videos led to improvements in selected activities and video quality. Expert scrutiny led to further video processing to include different perspectives of view and speeds of projected movements. Barriers identified included inability to imitate actions shown in videos and increased distractibility for some participants.¬†¬†¬† Conclusion: A video catalogue of LL activities was developed and validated. AOT was deemed safe and feasible for acute stroke rehabilitation and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

                Ciletuh Geopark Tourism Area (UNESCO Global Geopark Ciletuh Palabuhanratu) is now one of the main tourist attractions in the Sukabumi Regency, West Java province of Indonesia. The geopark area is in the Ciemas District. Based on the Regional Spatial Planning of the Sukabumi Regency, the Ciemas District is designated as the center of the agricultural sector activities for paddy rice plants in the Sukabumi District. Through the development of tourism activities, Ciletuh Palabuhanratu Geopark will undoubtedly threaten the rice farming sector in the area. In the disruption era, as technology changes, information and knowledge become more accessible. The development of these tourism activities will grow faster in Ciemas District, causing many changes, especially in physical space and regional economics. One change would be in the rice fields in this area, which has been transformed into built-in land in villas, inns, and homestays. If this is allowed, then the function of the sustainability of agricultural activities in the Ciemas District will be threatened. For this reason, control efforts are needed so that paddy fields that must be maintained do not change function quickly. This study analyzes the land use and land cover for paddy fields in Ciemas District. The method of this study is the quantitative method. The analytical methods include population projection, ArcGIS analysis, and Land Potential Index. The findings contribute to supporting the development of tourism while maintaining food security. The results indicate that there are protected areas from being prioritized, which are not prioritized for paddy fields, can be used for the development of tourism activities. Thus, this can be used as a source for the government to make policies for fulfilling food requirements and developing tourism activities in the region.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of protein complex partners as a compensatory mechanism in aneuploid tumors</a></h4>

              
                Aneuploidy, a state of chromosome imbalance, is a hallmark of human tumors, but its role in cancer still remains to be fully elucidated. To understand the consequences of whole-chromosome-level aneuploidies on the proteome, we integrated aneuploidy, transcriptomic and proteomic data from hundreds of TCGA/CPTAC tumor samples. We found a surprisingly large number of expression changes happened on other, non-aneuploid chromosomes. Moreover, we identified an association between those changes and co-complex members of proteins from aneuploid chromosomes. This co-abundance association is tightly regulated for aggregation-prone aneuploid proteins and those involved in a smaller number of complexes. On the other hand, we observe that complexes of the cellular core machinery are under functional selection to maintain their stoichiometric balance in aneuploid tumors. Ultimately, we provide evidence that those compensatory and functional maintenance mechanisms are established through post-translational control and that the degree of success of a tumor to deal with aneuploidy-induced stoichiometric imbalance impacts the activation of cellular protein degradation programs and patient survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stereospecific lasofoxifene derivatives reveal the interplay between estrogen receptor alpha stability and antagonistic activity in ESR1 mutant breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Chemical manipulation of estrogen receptor alpha ligand binding domain structural mobility tunes receptor lifetime and influences breast cancer therapeutic activities. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) extend ERŒ± cellular lifetime/accumulation. They are antagonists in the breast but agonists in the uterine epithelium and/or in bone. Selective estrogen receptor degraders/downregulators (SERDs) reduce ERŒ± cellular lifetime/accumulation and are pure antagonists. Activating somatic <i>ESR1</i> mutations Y537S and D538G enable resistance to first-line endocrine therapies. SERDs have shown significant activities in <i>ESR1</i> mutant setting while few SERMs have been studied. To understand whether chemical manipulation of ERŒ± cellular lifetime and accumulation influences antagonistic activity, we studied a series of methylpyrollidine lasofoxifene derivatives that maintained the drug's antagonistic activities while uniquely tuning ERŒ± cellular accumulation. These molecules were examined alongside a panel of antiestrogens in live cell assays of ERŒ± cellular accumulation, lifetime, SUMOylation, and transcriptional antagonism. High-resolution x-ray crystal structures of WT and Y537S ERŒ± ligand binding domain in complex with the methylated lasofoxifene derivatives or representative SERMs and SERDs show that molecules that favor a highly buried helix 12 antagonist conformation achieve the greatest transcriptional suppression activities in breast cancer cells harboring WT/Y537S <i>ESR1</i>. Together these results show that chemical reduction of ERŒ± cellular lifetime is not necessarily the most crucial parameter for transcriptional antagonism in <i>ESR1</i> mutated breast cancer cells. Importantly, our studies show how small chemical differences within a scaffold series can provide compounds with similar antagonistic activities, but with greatly different effects of the cellular lifetime of the ERŒ±, which is crucial for achieving desired SERM or SERD profiles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-PK promotes DNA end resection at DNA double strand breaks in G0 cells</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination is confined to the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle partly due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G<sub>1</sub> phase and non-cycling quiescent (G<sub>0</sub>) cells where DSBs are predominately repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Unexpectedly, we uncovered extensive MRE11- and CtIP-dependent DNA end resection at DSBs in G<sub>0</sub> murine and human cells. A whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen revealed the DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) complex as a key factor in promoting DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells. In agreement, depletion of FBXL12, which promotes ubiquitylation and removal of the KU70/KU80 subunits of DNA-PK from DSBs, promotes even more extensive resection in G<sub>0</sub> cells. In contrast, a requirement for DNA-PK in promoting DNA end resection in proliferating cells at the G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle was not observed. Our findings establish that DNA-PK uniquely promotes DNA end resection in G<sub>0</sub>, but not in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase cells, which has important implications for DNA DSB repair in quiescent cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Machine learning sequence prioritization for cell type-specific enhancer design</a></h4>

              
                Recent discoveries of extreme cellular diversity in the brain warrant rapid development of technologies to access specific cell populations within heterogeneous tissue. Available approaches for engineering-targeted technologies for new neuron subtypes are low yield, involving intensive transgenic strain or virus screening. Here, we present Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL), an improved virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and then make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons. Nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild-type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV+ neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. The SNAIL framework also has high utility for multispecies cell probe engineering; expression from a mouse PV+ SNAIL enhancer sequence was enriched in PV+ neurons of the macaque cortex. Expansion of this technology has broad applications in cell type-specific observation, manipulation, and therapeutics across species and disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Palatal morphology predicts the paleobiology of early salamanders</a></h4>

              
                Ecological preferences and life history strategies have enormous impacts on the evolution and phenotypic diversity of salamanders, but the yet established reliable ecological indicators from bony skeletons hinder investigations into the paleobiology of early salamanders. Here we statistically demonstrate, by using time-calibrated cladograms and geometric morphometric analysis on 71 specimens in 36 species, that both the shape of the palate and many non-shape covariates particularly associated with vomerine teeth are ecologically informative in early stem- and basal crown-group salamanders. Disparity patterns within the morphospace of the palate in ecological preferences, life history strategies and taxonomic affiliations were analyzed in detail, and evolutionary rates and ancestral states of the palate were reconstructed. Our results show that the palate is heavily impacted by convergence constrained by feeding mechanisms and also exhibits clear stepwise evolutionary patterns with alternative phenotypic configurations to cope with similar functional demand. Salamanders are diversified ecologically before the Middle Jurassic and achieved all their present ecological preferences in the Early Cretaceous. Our results reveal that the last common ancestor of all salamanders shares with other modern amphibians a unified biphasic ecological preference, and metamorphosis is significant in the expansion of ecomorphospace of the palate in early salamanders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcription elongation is finely tuned by dozens of regulatory factors</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the complex network that regulates transcription elongation requires the quantitative analysis of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity in a wide variety of regulatory environments. We performed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in 41 strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> lacking known elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, chromatin modifiers, and remodelers. We found that the opposing effects of these factors balance transcription elongation and antisense transcription. Different sets of factors tightly regulate Pol II progression across gene bodies so that Pol II density peaks at key points of RNA processing. These regulators control where Pol II pauses with each obscuring large numbers of potential pause sites that are primarily determined by DNA sequence and shape. Antisense transcription varies highly across the regulatory landscapes analyzed, but antisense transcription in itself does not affect sense transcription at the same locus. Our findings collectively show that a diverse array of factors regulate transcription elongation by precisely balancing Pol II activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and their native interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila</i> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that represent a target for insecticides. Peptide neurotoxins are known to block nAChRs by binding to their target subunits, however, a better understanding of this mechanism is needed for effective insecticide design. To facilitate the analysis of nAChRs we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate null alleles for all ten <i>nAChR</i> subunit genes in a common genetic background. We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles, we determined the effects of Œ±-Bungarotoxin (Œ±-Btx) and œâ-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm Œ±-Btx interactions with the <i>Drosophila</i> Œ±5 (D<i>Œ±</i>5), DŒ±6, D<i>Œ±</i>7 subunits. Finally, we report the localisation of fluorescent tagged endogenous DŒ±6 during <i>Drosophila</i> CNS development. Taken together, this study elucidates native <i>Drosophila</i> nAChR subunit interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins and provides a resource for the in vivo analysis of insect nAChRs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging unlabeled axons in the mouse retina by second harmonic generation</a></h4>

              
                We describe a novel microscopy for studying the network of axons in the unlabeled fresh wholemount retina. The intrinsic radiation of second harmonic generation (SHG) was utilized to visualize single axons of all major retinal neurons, i.e., photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and the retinal ganglion cells. The cell types of SHG+ axons were determined using transgenic GFP/YFP mice. New findings were obtained with retinal SHG imaging: Muller cells do not maintain uniformly polarized microtubules in the processes; SHG+ axons of bipolar cells terminate in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) in a subtype-specific manner; a subset of amacrine cells, presumably the axon-bearing types, emits SHG; and the axon-like neurites of amacrine cells provide a cytoskeletal scaffolding for the IPL stratification. To demonstrate the utility, retinal SHG imaging was applied for testing whether the inner retina is preserved in glaucoma, using DBA/2 mice as a model of glaucoma and DBA/2-Gpnmb+ as the non-glaucomatous control. It was found that the morphology of the inner retina was largely intact in glaucoma and the pre-synaptic compartments to the retinal ganglion cells were uncompromised. It proves retinal SHG imaging as a promising technology for studying the physiological and diseased retina in 3D.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying rhythmicity in perceptual reports</a></h4>

              
                Several recent studies investigated the rhythmic nature of cognitive processes that lead to perception and behavioral report. These studies used different methods, and there has not yet been an agreement on a general standard. Here, we present a way to test and quantitatively compare these methods. We simulated behavioral data from a typical experiment and analyzed these data with several methods. We applied the main methods found in the literature, namely sine-wave fitting, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Least Square Spectrum (LSS). DFT and LSS can be applied both on the averaged accuracy time course and on single trials. LSS is mathematically equivalent to DFT in the case of regular, but not irregular sampling - which is more common. LSS additionally offers the possibility to take into account a weighting factor which affects the strength of the rhythm, such as arousal. Statistical inferences were done either on the investigated sample (fixed-effect) or on the population (random-effect) of simulated participants. Multiple comparisons across frequencies were corrected using False-Discovery-Rate, Bonferroni, or the Max-Based approach. To perform a quantitative comparison, we calculated Sensitivity, Specificity and D-prime of the investigated analysis methods and statistical approaches. Within the investigated parameter range, single-trial methods had higher sensitivity and D-prime than the methods based on the averaged-accuracy-time-course. This effect was further increased for a simulated rhythm of higher frequency. If an additional (observable) factor influenced detection performance, adding this factor as weight in the LSS further improved Sensitivity and D-prime. For multiple comparison correction, the Max-Based approach provided the highest Specificity and D-prime, closely followed by the Bonferroni approach. Given a fixed total amount of trials, the random-effect approach had higher D-prime when trials were distributed over a larger number of participants, even though this gave less trials per participant. Finally, we present the idea of using a dampened sinusoidal oscillator instead of a simple sinusoidal function, to further improve the fit to behavioral rhythmicity observed after a reset event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">From recency to the central tendency bias in working memory: a unifying attractor network model</a></h4>

              
                Contraction bias is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory is biased towards the average of past observations. This phenomenon has been first described more than a century ago and since then, has been replicated in various decision making tasks in humans, and rodents. Contraction bias is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain, given the noisy nature of working memory. From a Bayesian perspective, the progressive shift of the noisy memory towards the mean of a prior distribution built from past sensory experience helps with more accurate estimates of the memory. In this work, we propose an alternative account, via short-term history biases (serial dependence). Our model is motivated and inspired by recent results from an auditory delayed-discrimination task in rats, where the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been shown to be critical to these memory effects. The dynamics of our model suggests that contraction bias can emerge as a result of a volatile working memory content which makes it susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience. The errors, at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli, and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the distribution's mean. Our model explains both short-term history biases, as well as contraction bias towards the sensory mean for the averaged performance. The results are consistent with the role of the PPC in encoding such sensory history biases, and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas.

                Precise synaptic connection of neurons with their targets is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A plethora of signaling pathways act in concert to mediate the precise spatial arrangement of synaptic connections. Here we show a novel role for a gap junction protein in controlling tiled synaptic arrangement in the GABAergic motor neurons in C. elegans, in which their axons and synapses overlap minimally with their neighboring neurons within the same class. We found that while EGL-20/Wnt controls axonal tiling, their presynaptic tiling is mediated by a gap junction protein UNC-9/Innexin, that is localized at the presynaptic tiling border between neighboring DD neurons. Strikingly, the gap junction channel activity of UNC-9 is dispensable for its function in controlling tiled presynaptic patterning. While gap junctions are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system as channels, our finding uncovered the novel channel-independent role of UNC-9 in synapse patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The time course of categorical and perceptual similarity effects in visual search</a></h4>

              
                During visual search for objects (e.g., an apple), the surrounding distractor objects may share perceptual (tennis ball), categorical (banana), or both (peach) properties with the target. Previous studies showed that the perceptual similarity between target and distractor objects influences visual search. Here, we tested whether categorical target-distractor similarity also influences visual search, and how this influence depends on perceptual similarity. By orthogonally manipulating categorical and perceptual target-distractor similarity, we could investigate how and when the two similarities interactively affect search performance and neural correlates of spatial attention (N2pc) using electroencephalography (EEG). Behavioral results showed that categorical target-distractor similarity interacted with perceptual target-distractor similarity, such that the effect of categorical similarity was strongest when target and distractor objects were perceptually similar. EEG results showed that perceptual similarity influenced the early part of the N2pc (200-250 ms after stimulus onset), while categorical similarity influenced the later part (250-300 ms). Mirroring the behavioral results, categorical similarity interacted with perceptual similarity during this later time window, with categorical effects only observed for perceptually similar target-distractor pairs. Together, these results provide evidence for hierarchical processing in visual search: categorical properties influence spatial attention only when perceptual properties are insufficient to guide attention to the target.

Public significance statementSearching for a target object among perceptually similar distractor objects (e.g., looking for an apple among peaches) is relatively difficult. In daily life, target and distractor objects may not only share perceptual but also non-perceptual properties, such as category membership (e.g., fruit). Here, we show that categorical similarity between target and distractor objects influences search performance, particularly when target and distractor objects are perceptually similar. Using electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that attentional selection is first influenced by perceptual and then by categorical information. This later categorical influence depended on perceptual similarity, being strongest for perceptually similar objects. These findings provide evidence for hierarchical processing in visual search, with categorical properties extracted after perceptual properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Individual Differences in Mental Information from Human Brain Response Predicted by Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Recent advantages of brain decoding with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have enabled us to estimate individual differences in mental information from brain responses to natural sensory inputs. However, the physical constraints and costs of fMRI measurements prevent brain decoding from achieving real-world applications. To address this issue, this study aims to build a framework to decode individual differences in mental information under natural situations via brain-response prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Once the CNN-based prediction model is constructed using measured brain response, mental information can be decoded from the predicted responses of individual brains with no additional fMRI measurements. As per our analysis, it was found that in 81 of 87 items to be decoded, this framework captured individual difference patterns consistent with conventional decoding using measured brain responses. Our framework has great potential to decode personal mental information with minimal fMRI measuring constraints or costs, which substantially expands the applicability of brain decoding in daily life.

                Landmark-based and self-motion-based navigation are two fundamental forms of spatial navigation, which involve distinct cognitive mechanisms. A critical question is whether these two navigation modes invoke common or distinct spatial representations for a given environment in the brain. While a number of electrophysiological studies in non-human animals have investigated this question but yielded inconsistent results, it still awaits rigorous investigation in humans. In the current study, we combined ultra-high field fMRI at 7T and desktop virtual reality with state-of-the-art fMRI data analysis techniques. Using a novel linear track navigation task, we dissociated the use of landmarks and self-motion cues, so that participants used different spatial cues to encode and retrieve the same set of spatial locations. Focusing on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus, we observed that RSC contained both cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations, which were driven by objective location (where the participant was actually located) and subjective location (the participant's self-reported location), respectively. The hippocampus showed strong functional coupling with RSC and exhibited a similar spatial coding scheme, but with reduced effect sizes. Taken together, the current study demonstrated for the first time concurrent cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations in RSC in the same spatial context, suggesting that this area might transform cue-specific spatial inputs into coherent cue-independent spatial representations to guide navigation behavior.

                Most contemporary theories of sensorimotor decision-making formalize the process leading up to a decision as a gradual accumulation of stimulus information over time. In the currently prevailing view, the amount of accumulated evidence required for a decision is independent of the amount of sensory evidence presented by the stimulus, and once that level is reached, a choice is categorically communicated to the motor system to execute an overt response. Recent experiments cast doubt on these assumptions. We adopt a broader perspective by specifying a model with both an evidence and a motor accumulation process. The evidence accumulation signal feeds into a leaky motor accumulator, and it is on the level of the motor accumulation that the final decision criterion is set. We show that this alternative theory describes the behavioral data better, especially when it comes to urgency manipulations, and its neural correlates can be derived from EEG signatures involving systems of both evidence and motor accumulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of sound and locomotion information by auditory cortical neuronal ensembles</a></h4>

              
                The ability to process and act upon incoming sounds during locomotion is critical for survival. Intriguingly, sound responses of auditory cortical neurons are on average weaker during locomotion as compared to immobility and these results have been suggested to reflect a computational resource allocation shift from auditory to visual processing. However, the evolutionary benefit of this hypothesis remains unclear. In particular, whether weaker sound-evoked responses during locomotion indeed reflect a reduced involvement of the auditory cortex, or whether they result from an alternative neural computation in this state remains unresolved. To address this question, we first used neural inactivation in behaving mice and found that the auditory cortex plays a critical role in sound-guided behavior during locomotion. To investigate the nature of this processing, we used two-photon calcium imaging of local excitatory auditory cortical neural populations in awake mice. We found that underlying a net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked response magnitude, spatially intermingled neuronal subpopulations were differentially influenced by locomotion. Further, the net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked responses was strongly shaped by elevated ongoing activity. Importantly, rather than reflecting enhanced "noise", this ongoing activity reliably encoded the animals locomotion speed. Prediction analyses revealed that sound, locomotive state and their integration are strongly encoded by auditory cortical ensemble activity. Finally, we found consistent patterns of locomotion-sound integration in electrophysiologically recorded activity in freely moving rats. Together, our data suggest that auditory cortical ensembles are not simply suppressed by locomotion but rather encode it alongside sound information to support sound perception during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of differentially expressed novel tau associated proteins in transgenic AD model of Drosophila - a proteomic and in silico Approach</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a memory related neurodegenerative disorder mainly associated with older adults. In this study, transgenic Drosophila AD model has been employed to investigate the tau associated proteome. Tau expression was specifically induced in the eye tissues and diseased fly heads were considered for proteomic studies with appropriate controls. We have identified 6 novel proteins from tau induced AD group by 2D and PD Quest analyses and further characterized them by in-vivo and in-silico approaches. The novel Tau interactors, [Obp44a Isoform A, Pglym Isoform A, IP15846p (Adh variant), RE45450p (mRpL2), Retinin, and Glob1 Isoform B], identified by MALDI-TOF/MS were validated through q-RT-PCR. The altered metabolic, behavioral and mitochondrial dynamics associated with Tau over expressing AD flies could be due to the altered expression of Odorant binding protein 44a (Obp44a) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 (mRpL2), respectively. Further, we have showed for the first time the newly identified protein interaction with tau and other regulatory proteins through protein-protein docking, biocomputational classification and evolutionary relationship using in silico studies. Moreover, the study highlights the plausible role of these novel proteins in pathophysiology of phospho-tau induced AD flies and further help unraveling molecular pathways implicated in tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Focal electrical stimulation on an alcohol disorder model using MRI-compatible chronic neural monopolar carbon fiber electrodes.</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation interventions, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are proposed as possible new complementary therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). It is hypothesized that neuromodulation may induce neural plasticity in the reward and frontostriatal systems via electrical field induction, possibly reducing symptoms. Preclinical self-administration rodent models of AUD may help us gain insight into the effects of neuromodulation therapies on different pathology, as well as the neural mechanisms behind the positive effects. DBS, or any type of brain stimulation using intracranial electrodes in rodents, would benefit from the use of MRI to study the longitudinal effects and mechanisms of stimulation as well as novel targets, as it is a non-invasive technique that allows the analysis of structural and functional changes in the brain. To do this, there is a need for MRI-compatible electrodes that allow for MRI acquisition with minimal distortion of the magnetic field. In this protocol, we present a method for the construction and surgery of chronically implantable monopolar carbon electrodes for use in rats. Unlike conventional electrodes, carbon electrodes are resistant to high temperatures, flexible, and generate fewer artifacts in MRI compared to conventional ones. We validated its use by using a focal electrical stimulation high-frequency (20 Hz) protocol that lasted ~10 sessions. We propose that this technique can also be used for the research of the neurophysiological bases of the neuromodulatory treatment in other preclinical substance use disorders (SUD) models.

                Painful peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication associated with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection. Currently available treatments fail to provide adequate symptom relief, indicating the need for novel treatment strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we characterized the impact of cannabinoid CB2 agonists, which lack psychoactivity associated with central CB1 activation, on antiretroviral-induced neuropathic nociception and identified cell types expressing CB2 that mediate the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. Two structurally distinct CB2 agonists (AM1710 and LY2828360) alleviated antiretroviral-induced neuropathic pain, benefits which were absent in CB2 knockout mice. Conditional deletion of CB2 from peripheral sensory neurons eliminated the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. We also asked whether LY2828360 treatment could reverse established morphine tolerance in the ddC-induced neuropathy model and whether CB2 expression on peripheral sensory neurons is necessary for sparing of morphine tolerance by LY2828360. The present studies suggest that CB2 activation may alleviate HIV-associated antiretroviral neuropathy and identify a previously unreported mechanism through which CB2 activation produces antinociceptive efficacy. Our results also provide the first evidence that a CB2 agonist can reverse established morphine tolerance and demonstrate that CB2 localized to peripheral sensory neurons mediates the opioid tolerance sparing efficacy of CB2 agonists.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule Constrains Dendritic Spine Density through Ankyrin Binding in Pyramidal Neurons of the Mouse Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                A novel function for L1 cell adhesion molecule and its interaction with Ankyrin, an actin-spectrin adaptor protein, was identified in constraining dendritic spine density on pyramidal neurons in the mouse neocortex. In an L1-null mouse mutant increased spine density was observed on apical but not basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in diverse cortical areas (prefrontal cortex layer 2/3, motor cortex layer 5, visual cortex layer 4).The Ankyrin binding motif (FIGQY) in L1s cytoplasmic domain was critical for spine formation, as demonstrated by increased spine density in the prefrontal cortex of a mouse mutant (L1YH) harboring a tyrosine to histidine mutation in this motif, which disrupts L1-Ankyrin association. This mutation is a known variant in the human L1 syndrome. In both mutants mature mushroom spines rather than immature spines were predominant. L1 was detected in spines and dendrites of wild-type prefrontal cortical neurons by immmunostaining. L1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ankyrin B (220 kDa) from cortical lysates of wild-type but not L1YH mice. Spine pruning assays in cortical neuron cultures from wild-type and L1YH mutant mice showed that the L1-Ankyrin interaction mediated spine retraction in response to the class 3 Semaphorins, Sema3F and to a lesser extent Sema3B. These ligands also induce spine pruning through other L1 family adhesion molecules, NrCAM and Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1), respectively. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of spine regulation and underscore the potential for this adhesion molecule to regulate cognitive and other L1-related functions that are abnormal in the L1 syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gray Matter Volumetric Correlates of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Traits in Emerging Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has demonstrated reduction in cortical and subcortical, including basal ganglia (BG), gray matter volumes (GMV) in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental condition that is more prevalent in males than in females. However, the volumetric deficits vary across studies. Whether volumetric reductions are more significant in males than females; to what extent these neural markers are heritable and relate to cognitive dysfunction in ADHD remain unclear. To address these questions, we followed published routines and performed voxel-based morphometry analysis of a data set (n = 11,502; 5,464 girls, 9-10 years) curated from the Adolescent Brain Cognition Development project, a population-based study of typically developing children. Of the sample, 634 and 2,826 were identified as monozygotic twins (MZ) and dizygotic twins/siblings (DZ), respectively. In linear regressions, a cluster in the hypothalamus showed larger GMV, and bilateral caudate and putamen, lateral orbitofrontal and occipital cortex showed smaller GMVs, in correlation with higher ADHD scores in girls and boys combined. When examined separately, boys relative to girls showed more widespread (including BG) and stronger associations between GMV deficits and ADHD scores. ADHD traits and the volumetric correlates demonstrated heritability estimates (a2) between 0.59 and 0.79, replicating prior findings of the genetic basis of ADHD. Further, ADHD traits and the volumetric correlates (except for the hypothalamus) were each negatively and positively correlated with N-back performance. Together, these findings confirm volumetric deficits in children with more prominent ADHD traits. Highly heritable in both girls and boys and potentially more significant in boys than in girls, the structural deficits underlie diminished capacity in working memory and potentially other cognitive deficits in ADHD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal dynamics of recognition memory for complex versus simple auditory sequences</a></h4>

              
                Differently from visual recognition, auditory recognition is a process relying on the organization of single elements that evolve in time. Here, we aimed to discover the spatiotemporal dynamics of this cognitive function by adopting a novel strategy for varying the complexity of musical sequences. We selected traditional tonal musical sequences and altered the distance between pitches to obtain matched atonal sequences. We then recorded the brain activity of 71 participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they listened to and later recognized auditory sequences constructed according to simple (tonal) or complex (atonal) conventions. Results reveal qualitative changes in neural activity dependent on stimulus complexity: recognition of tonal sequences engaged hippocampal and cingulate areas, whereas recognition of atonal sequences mainly activated the auditory processing network. Our findings highlight the involvement of a cortico-subcortical brain network for auditory recognition and support the idea that stimulus complexity qualitatively alters the neural pathways of recognition memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pathway and directional specificity of Hebbian plasticity induction in the cortical visual motion processing network</a></h4>

              
                Cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), which repeatedly pairs single pulse TMS over two distant brain regions with a specific time interval, is thought to modulate synaptic plasticity. Applied to the motion cortical pathway, ccPAS has been shown to improve motion discrimination when specifically targeting backward projections, stimulating the medio-temporal area (MT) followed by the primary visual cortex (V1). However, there is no direct neuroimaging evidence of the spatial selectivity of the ccPAS effects (i.e., pathway or direction specificity) or detailing the exact nature of the ccPAS effects (i.e., the oscillatory signature, timing). In this study, we applied ccPAS along the motion discrimination pathway, in the top-down direction (MT-to-V1: Backward ccPAS) and in the bottom-up direction (V1-to-MT: Forward ccPAS) in sixteen healthy volunteers and compared changes in visual network activity in response to single pulse TMS over V1 and MT using spectral granger causality (sGC). The sGC results showed common increases in direct V1-to-MT and V1-to-IPS bottom-up inputs in the high Beta/low Gamma band (25-40 Hz) for both ccPAS, probably reflecting task exposure. However, a clear distinction in information transfer occurred in the re-entrant MT-to-V1 signals, which were only modulated by Backward ccPAS. This difference was predictive of the behavioural improvements at the motion discrimination task. Our results support the view of the possibility to specifically enhance re-entrant Alpha oscillatory signals from MT-to-V1 to promote motion discrimination performance through Backward ccPAS. These findings contribute to better understanding visual processing in healthy subjects and how it can be modulated to pave the way to clinical translation in vision handicapped patients. The changes in re-entrant MT-to-V1 inputs could help to provide single-subject prediction scenarios in patients suffering from a visual system stroke, in whom visual recovery might partly rely on the top-down inputs to the spared V1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered Regulation of Ia Afferent Input during Voluntary Activity after Human Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input converging on the spinal cord contributes to the control of voluntary activity. Although sensory pathways reorganize following spinal cord injury (SCI), the extent to which sensory input from Ia afferents is regulated during voluntary activity after the injury remains largely unknown. To address this question, we examined the soleus H-reflex and conditioning of the H-reflex by stimulating homonymous and heteronymous nerves [depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by common peroneal nerve stimulation (D1 inhibition) and the monosynaptic Ia facilitation of the soleus H-reflex evoked by femoral nerve stimulation (FN facilitation)] at rest, and during tonic voluntary activity in humans with and without chronic incomplete SCI. We found that during voluntary activity the soleus H-reflex size increased in both groups compared with rest, but to a lesser extent in SCI participants. Compared with rest, the D1 inhibition decreased during voluntary activity in controls but it was still present in SCI participants. Further, the FN facilitation increased in controls but remained unchanged in SCI participants during voluntary activity compared with rest. Changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation were correlated with changes in the H-reflex during voluntary activity, suggesting an association between outcomes. These findings provide the first demonstration that the regulation of Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves is altered during voluntary in humans with SCI, resulting in lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons.

                BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most common aging-associated neurodegenerative disease; nevertheless, the etiology and progression of the disease is still incompletely understood. We have previously shown that the microbially-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with cognitive impairment due to AD and positively correlates with increases in CSF biomarkers for tangle, plaque, and neuronal pathology.

ObjectiveWe assessed the direct impact of TMAO on AD progression.

MethodsTo do so, transgenic 5XFAD mice were supplemented with TMAO for 12 weeks.

ResultsOral TMAO administration resulted in significantly reduced neurite density in several regions of the brain, as assessed through quantitative brain microstructure imaging with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Amyloid-{beta} plaque mean intensity was reduced, while plaque count and size remained unaltered. Proteomics analysis of the cortex revealed that TMAO treatment impacted the expression of 31 proteins (1.5-fold cut-off) in 5XFAD mice, including proteins known to influence neuronal health and amyloid-{beta} precursor protein processing. TMAO treatment did not alter astrocyte and microglial response (as determined by histological analysis) nor cortical synaptic protein expression.

ConclusionThese data suggest that elevated plasma TMAO impacts AD pathology via reductions in neurite density.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interneurons of fan-shaped body promote arousal in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is required to maintain physiological functions and is widely conserved across species. To understand the sleep-regulatory mechanisms, sleep-regulating genes and neuronal circuits are studied in various animal species. In the sleep-regulatory neuronal circuits in Drosophila melanogaster, the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) is a major sleep-promoting region. However, other sleep-regulating neuronal circuits were not well identified. We recently found a novel sleep-regulatory circuit consisting of arousal-promoting T1 dopamine neurons and protocerebral bridge (PB) neurons innervating the ventral part of the FB, which we named "the PB-FB pathway". However, the post-synaptic target of the PB-FB pathway was still unknown. To identify it, we performed anterograde tracing, immunohistochemistry, and Ca2+ imaging analysis and found that the PB-FB pathway projects to FB interneurons, also known as pontine neurons. Besides, we found that cholinergic pontine neurons promote arousal. Moreover, we indicated that pontine neurons form an anatomical connection with sleep-promoting dFB neurons. Together, we showed that pontine neurons receive excitatory signals from the PB-FB pathway and cholinergic pontine neurons promote arousal. These results completed one of the output pathways from the PB-FB pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-and Low-Frequency Deep Brain Stimulation in the Subthalamic Nucleus differentially modulate Response Inhibition and Action Selection in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundWhile deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor functions in Parkinsons disease (PD), it has also been associated with increased impulsivity.

MethodsA combined approach of eye-tracking and high-density EEG was used to investigate how high- and low-frequency DBS impact impulsive actions in the antisaccade task in a cohort of ten persons with PD. Computational modelling of the behavioral outcomes allowed a nuanced insight into the effect of DBS on response inhibition and action selection processes. Results: Against our expectations, both 130 Hz- and 60 Hz-DBS improved response inhibition as both resulted in a reduced rate of early reflexive errors. Correspondingly, DBS with both frequencies led to increased desynchronization of beta power during the preparatory period which may be a correlate of anticipatory activation in the oculomotor network.

Low-frequency DBS additionally was associated with increased midfrontal theta power, an established marker of cognitive control. While higher midfrontal theta power predicted longer antisaccade latencies in off-DBS state on a trial-by-trial basis, 130 Hz-DBS reversed this relationship. As informed by the computational model, 130 Hz-DBS further led to a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off causing an acceleration and error-proneness of actions later in the trial.

ConclusionsOur results disentangle the impact of DBS on early and late impulsive actions. Only 130 Hz-DBS may disrupt theta-mediated cognitive control mechanisms via medial frontal - STN pathways that are involved in delaying action selection. 60 Hz-DBS may provide beneficial effects on response inhibition without the detrimental effect on action selection seen with 130 Hz-DBS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus c{oelig}ruleus noradrenergic neurons phase-lock to prefrontal cortical and hippocampal infra-slow rhythms which synchronize with behavioral events</a></h4>

              
                The locus cruleus (LC) is the primary source of noradrenergic projections to the forebrain, and, in prefrontal cortex, is implicated in decision-making and executive function. LC neurons phase-lock to cortical slow wave oscillations during sleep. Such slow rhythms are rarely reported in awake states, despite their interest since they correspond to the time scale of behavior. Thus, we investigated LC neuronal synchrony with infra-slow rhythms in awake rats performing an attentional set-shifting task. Local field potential (LFPs) oscillation cycles in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on the order of 0.4 Hz phase-locked to task events at crucial maze locations. Indeed, successive cycles of the infra-slow rhythm showed different wavelengths, and thus these are not periodic oscillations. Simultaneously recorded infra-slow rhythms in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus showed different cycle durations as well. Most LC neurons (including optogenetically identified noradrenergic neurons) recorded here were phase-locked to these infra-slow rhythms, as were hippocampal and prefrontal units recorded on the LFP probes. The infra-slow oscillations also phase-modulated gamma amplitude, linking these rhythms at the time scale of behavior to those coordinating neuronal synchrony. Noradrenaline, released by LC neurons in concert with the infra-slow rhythm, would facilitate synchronizing or resetting those brain networks, underlying behavioral adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effect of Fas activation on spinal muscular atrophy motoneuron death and induction of axonal growth</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are the most common motoneuron diseases affecting adults and infants, respectively. ALS and SMA are both characterized by the selective degeneration of motoneurons. Although different in their genetic etiology, growing evidence indicate that they share molecular and cellular pathogenic signatures that constitute potential common therapeutic targets. We previously described a motoneuron-specific death pathway elicited by the Fas death receptor, whereby vulnerable ALS motoneurons show an exacerbated sensitivity to Fas activation. However, the mechanisms that drive the loss of SMA motoneurons remains poorly understood. Here, we describe an in vitro model of SMA-associated degeneration using primary motoneurons derived from Smn2B/- SMA mice and show that Fas activation selectively triggers death of the proximal motoneurons. Fas-induced death of SMA motoneurons has the molecular signature of the motoneuron-selective Fas death pathway that requires activation of p38 kinase, caspase-8, -9 and -3 as well as upregulation of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4). In addition, Rho Kinase (ROCK) is required for Fas recruitment. Remarkably, we found that exogenous activation of Fas also promotes axonal elongation in both wildtype and SMA motoneurons. Axon outgrowth of motoneurons promoted by Fas requires the activity of ERK, ROCK and caspases. This work defines a dual role of Fas signaling in motoneurons that can elicit distinct responses from cell death to axonal growth.

	<p>Patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) often suffer from non-motor symptoms, which may be caused by serotonergic dysfunction. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may also influence non-motor symptoms. The aim of this study is to investigate how the cerebral 5-HT system associates to disturbances in cognition and mood in PD patients with DBS-STN turned on and off. We used psychological tests and questionnaires to evaluate cognitive function and the effects on mood from turning DBS-STN off. We applied a novel PET neuroimaging methodology to evaluate the integrity of the cerebral serotonin system. We measured 5-HT1BR binding in 13 DBS-STN-treated PD patients, at baseline and after turning DBS off. Thirteen age-matched volunteers served as controls. The measures for cognition and mood were correlated to the 5-HT1BR availability in temporal limbic cortex. 5-HT1BR binding was proportional to working memory performance and inverse proportional to affective bias for face recognition. When DBS is turned off, patients feel less vigorous; the higher the limbic and temporal 5-HT1BR binding, the more they are affected by DBS being turned off. Our study suggests that cerebral 5-HTR binding is associated with non-motor symptoms, and that preservation of serotonergic functions may be predictive of DBS-STN effects.</p>

	<p>Locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are controlled by glutamatergic inputs. Here, we studied in brain slices of neonatal rats NMDA and glutamate effects on phase-locked LC neuron spiking at ~1 Hz summating to ~0.2 s-lasting bell-shaped local field potential (LFP). NMDA: 10 &amp;amp;mu;M accelerated LFP 1.7-fold, whereas 25 and 50 &amp;amp;mu;M, respectively, increased its rate 3.2- and 4.6-fold while merging discrete events into 43 and 56% shorter oscillations. After 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 min, LFP oscillations stopped every 6 s for 1 s, resulting in &amp;amp;lsquo;oscillation trains&amp;amp;rsquo;. A dose of 32 &amp;amp;mu;M depolarized neurons by 8.4 mV to cause 7.2-fold accelerated spiking at reduced jitter and enhanced synchrony with the LFP, as evident from cross-correlation. Glutamate: 25&amp;amp;ndash;50 &amp;amp;mu;M made rhythm more irregular and the LFP pattern could transform into 2.7-fold longer-lasting multipeak discharge. In 100 &amp;amp;mu;M, LFP amplitude and duration declined. In 25&amp;amp;ndash;50 &amp;amp;mu;M, neurons depolarized by 5 mV to cause 3.7-fold acceleration of spiking that was less synchronized with LFP. Both agents: evoked &amp;amp;lsquo;post-agonist depression&amp;amp;rsquo; of LFP that correlated with the amplitude and kinetics of Vm hyperpolarization. The findings show that accelerated spiking during NMDA and glutamate is associated with enhanced or attenuated LC synchrony, respectively, causing distinct LFP pattern transformations. Shaping of LC population discharge dynamics by ionotropic glutamate receptors potentially fine-tunes its influence on brain functions.</p>

	<p>Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) signifies a failure in representing quantities, which impairs the performance of basic math operations and schooling achievement during childhood. The lack of specificity in assessment measures and respective cut-offs are the most challenging factors to identify children with DD, particularly in disadvantaged educational contexts. This research is focused on a numerical cognition battery for children, designed to diagnose DD through 12 subtests. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the prevalence of DD in a country with generally low educational attainment, by comparing z-scores and percentiles, and to test three neurodevelopmental models of numerical cognition based on performance in this battery. Participants were 304 Brazilian school children aged 7&amp;amp;ndash;12 years of both sexes (143 girls), assessed by the Zareki-R. Performances on subtests and the total score increase with age without gender differences. The prevalence of DD was 4.6% using the fifth percentile and increased to 7.4% via z-score (in total 22 out of 304 children were diagnosed with DD). We suggest that a minus 1.5 standard deviation in the total score of the Zareki-R is a useful criterion in the clinical or educational context. Nevertheless, a percentile &amp;amp;le; 5 seems more suitable for research purposes, especially in developing countries because the socioeconomic environment or/and educational background are strong confounder factors to diagnosis. The four-factor structure, based on von Aster and Shalev&amp;amp;rsquo;s model of numerical cognition (Number Sense, Number Comprehension, Number Production and Calculation), was the best model, with significant correlations ranging from 0.89 to 0.97 at the 0.001 level.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma are the most common primary malignant brain tumors with a highly infiltrative behavior. The extent of resection of the enhancing component has been shown to be correlated to survival. Recently, it has been proposed to move the resection beyond the contrast-enhanced portion into the MR hyper intense tissue which typically surrounds the tumor, the so-called supra marginal resection (SMR). Though it should be associated with better overall survival (OS), a potential harmful resection must be avoided in order not to create new neurological deficits. Through this work, we aimed to perform a critical review of SMR in patients with Glioblastoma. A Medline database search and a pooled meta-analysis of HRs were conducted; 19 articles were included. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled OS HR of 0.64 (p = 0.052). SMR is generally considered as the resection of any T1w gadolinium-enhanced tumor exceeding FLAIR volume, but no consensus exists about the amount of volume that must be resected to have an OS gain. Equally, the role and the weight of several pre-operative features (tumor volume, location, eloquence, etc.), the intraoperative methods to extend resection, and the post-operative deficits, need to be considered more deeply in future studies.</p>

	<p>Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders (TDs) are closely related and considered to etiologically overlap. Both disorders are characterized by repetitive behaviors. TD and OCD often co-occur. The high comorbidity between OCD and TD individuals suggests that we also need to pay more attention to the homogeneity and heterogeneity between TS and OCD. To date, there has been no systematic nationwide epidemiological survey of the mental health (including tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder) of children and adolescents in China. Methods: A two-stage epidemiological study of psychiatric point prevalence was conducted. We used the multistage cluster stratified random sampling strategy to assess five provinces of China. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to identify behavioral problems among the enrolled students in the first stage. The results from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents and evaluations from two psychiatrists based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV were used to make a diagnosis. Point weighted prevalence for TD and OCD was estimated. We adjusted prevalence estimates with the product of sampling weights and poststratification weights. Standard error values and 95% confidential intervals were generated with Taylor series linearization. Rao&amp;amp;ndash;Scott adjusted chi-square (&amp;amp;chi;2) tests were employed to compare the prevalence estimates of different age and sex groups. Results: In the first stage, 73,992 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;16 years old were selected. The prevalence rates of OCD and TDs were 1.37% (95% CI: 1.28&amp;amp;ndash;1.45) and 2.46% (95% CI: 2.35&amp;amp;ndash;2.57), respectively. The prevalence of OCD was found to be higher in girls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and higher in boys with transient tic disorder (TTD) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (TS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The most common comorbidity of TS was OCD (40.73%), and for OCD, it was TS (11.36%). Conclusions: Our study is the first nationwide survey on the prevalence of TD (2.46%) and OCD (1.37%) in school students aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;16 years old in China. The high comorbidity between OCD and TD individuals suggested overlap based on the prevalence dimensions, which might be influenced by age and sex. This result suggested that we also need to pay more attention to the homogeneity and heterogeneity between TS and OCD.</p>

                Miersch et al., used modular design principles to develop a tetravalent antibody format that can combine two antibodies into a single molecule. They show that a bi-paratopic tetravalent antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 behaves like conventional IgGs (e.g. yield, purity, stability, solubility) but potently and broadly inhibits variants that resist IgG drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Individualized Neural Tuning Model: Precise and generalizable cartography of functional architecture in individual brains</a></h4>

              
                How brain functional architecture differs across people is a key question of human neuroscience, and understanding these differences is critical for building brain-based biomarkers. However, current individualized models of brain functional organization are based on brain regions and networks, limiting their use to study fine-grained vertex- or voxel-level differences. In this work, we present the Individualized Neural Tuning (INT) model, a fine-grained individualized model of brain functional organization. The first part of the INT model models each individual's brain responses as a linearly transformed functional template, such that it captures both functional and topographic idiosyncrasies. The second part of the INT model factorizes the modeled brain responses, separating temporal information capturing how the stimulus changes over time (shared across individuals) and stimulus-general neural tuning (specific to each individual and each cortex). The two parts of the INT model are designed in such a way that (a) the INT model has vertex-level granularity; (b) it models both functional differences and topographic differences; and (c) the modeled neural tuning is stimulus-general in that it generalizes to new stimuli. Through a series of analyzes, we demonstrate that (a) the modeled brain functional organization is highly specific to the individual and reliable across independent data; (b) the model can predict an individual's responses to new stimuli based on others' responses, including category selectivity maps and retinotopic maps; (c) the model can predict fine-grained response patterns, which can be used to distinguish responses to different time points of a movie; (d) the model performance keeps improving with more data, but 10-20 minutes of movie are usually sufficient for good performance. Together, these analyses demonstrate that the INT model affords an individualized fine-grained model of brain functional architecture, which is reliable, precise, and generalizable across stimuli.

                The spinal cord and its interactions with the brain are fundamental for movement control and somatosensation. However, brain and spinal cord electrophysiology in humans have largely been treated as distinct enterprises, in part due to the relative inaccessibility of the spinal cord. Consequently, there is a dearth of knowledge on human spinal electrophysiology, including the multiple pathologies of the central nervous system that affect the spinal cord as well as the brain. Here we exploit recent advances in the development of wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) which can be flexibly arranged to provide coverage of both the spinal cord and the brain concurrently in unconstrained environments. Our system for magnetospinoencephalography (MSEG) measures both spinal and cortical signals simultaneously by employing a custom-made spinal scanning cast. We evidence the utility of such a system by recording simultaneous spinal and cortical evoked responses to median nerve stimulation, demonstrating the novel ability for concurrent non-invasive millisecond imaging of brain and spinal cord.

                Neurons from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the first to accumulate tau protein aggregates and degenerate during prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Here, we use a data-driven functional genomics approach to model ECII neurons in silico and identify the proto-oncogene DEK as a potential driver of tau pathology. By modulating DEK levels in EC neurons in vitro and in vivo, we first validate the accuracy and cell-type specificity of our network predictions. We then show that Dek silencing changes the inducibility of immediate early genes and alters neuron excitability, leading to dysregulation of neu- ronal plasticity genes. We further find that loss of function of DEK leads to tau accumulation in the soma of ECII neurons, reactivity of surrounding microglia, and eventually microglia-mediated neuron loss. This study validates a pathological gene discovery tool that opens new therapeutic avenues and sheds light on a novel pathway driving tau pathology in vulnerable neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The canonical HPA axis contributes to locomotion during photoadaptation but is not required</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its effector molecules-glucocorticoids-modulate diverse aspects of physiology in vertebrates ranging from metabolism to immune function, behavior, and circadian cycle. While the glucocorticoid receptor (nr3c1) is known to be involved in light adaptation (photoadaptation) of the retinal cells, the role of nr3c1 and other HPA axis signaling molecules in the behavioral phenotypes observed during photoadaptation have not been delineated. Therefore, we investigated locomotor adaptation to various light/dark durations using larval zebrafish that carry a mutated allele in key HPA axis receptors. First, we established baseline locomotion and compared WT and nr3c1 mutant larvae in constantly lit and dark conditions (for 12-hrs). WT larval zebrafish showed highest locomotor activity in the middle of the day and low activity during the early and later parts of the day, which was generally higher in the light. The baseline locomotion was depressed in nr3c1 mutants throughout the day in both environments with a more significant change noted in the light. Next, groups of larvae mutant in nr3c1, nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor), or mc2r (melanocortin receptor type 2; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor) along with their wildtype (WT) siblings were acclimated in the dark and underwent four cycles of dark-light illumination changes with different durations of illumination: 7.5, 6, 4, or 2 min. The nr3c1 and mc2r mutant fish showed significantly decreased locomotion during the dark phase when the illumination was provided for 4 or 2 min. However, with 4 min or longer illumination, if locomotor deficits were observed in mutant larvae, they demonstrated a "catch-up" phenotype with increasing locomotion during the later dark phases of the assay and ultimately reaching the swimming distances indistinguishable from their WT siblings in the assays with 7.5-min illumination. Finally, we looked at effects of light intensity, beginning with our short light exposure. A lower intensity of light failed to elicit any response even from WT fish after 1-min illumination. However, this dim light still evoked a robust response from nr3c1 mutants and their WT siblings after 7.5-min illumination. The nr3c2 mutant larvae consistently showed locomotor response similar to their WT siblings regardless of the length of the light phase. Thus, activation of the canonical HPA axis (i.e. nr3c1, mc2r) was necessary to induce a rapid locomotor adaptation following after light to dark transition with shorter light exposure times (< 4 min), but it was not needed for locomotor responses observed after longer exposure to light (> 4 min). Moreover, the locomotor response after transitioning to dark from a short (1 min) exposure was dependent on the intensity of light, whereas the longer exposure was not. Together, these findings suggest that locomotion after longer exposure to light is not dependent on the HPA axis, suggesting that either parallel independent pathway(s) are responsible for the locomotor response in these cases or that the HPA axis facilitates a primary pathway to increase sensitivity to light exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Category representations in the primary visual cortex support orientation discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual discrimination requires the ability to determine that two stimuli are different. It is well established that neuronal representations in sensory cortices (i.e. the specific neuronal activity patterns evoked by the stimuli) are essential for perceptual choice. Yet, the general principles by which those representations are compared in sensory systems remain paradoxically elusive. Indeed, the resolution of the neuronal representations is an order of magnitude more precise than the discrimination capabilities of the animals during behavioral tasks. This large discrepancy between theoretical neural resolution and actual animal discrimination threshold suggests that the integrative mechanisms leading to perceptual decision are computationally limited. To determine those computational constraints, we recorded the activity of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice performing a Go/NoGo orientation discrimination task. We found that two oriented cues were perfectly perceived as distinct when there was no overlap between their neuronal representations. However, at the limit of discriminability, V1 activity stopped encoding for the orientation of the visual stimulus. Instead, we observed a funneling of the V1 activity toward distinct domains of the orientation representation space, likely generated by an orientation-dependent modulation of the neuronal excitability. The relative neuronal activity at those domains provided a probabilistic indication that the stimulus belonged to the Go or NoGo category. Thus, the categorical classification by V1 of the presented stimulus predicts accurately the probabilities of the animals' perceptual decisions.

                Independently, chronic cocaine use and HIV-1 viral protein exposure induce neuroadaptations in the frontal-striatal circuit; how the frontal-striatal circuit responds to HIV-1 infection following chronic drug use, however, has remained elusive. After establishing a history of both sucrose and cocaine self-administration, a pretest-posttest experimental design was utilized to evaluate preference judgment, a simple form of decision-making dependent upon the integrity of frontal-striatal circuit function. During the pretest assessment, male rats exhibited a clear preference for cocaine, whereas female animals preferred sucrose. Two posttest evaluations (3 Days and 6 Weeks Post Inoculation) revealed that, independent of biological sex, inoculation with chimeric HIV (EcoHIV), but not saline, disrupted decision-making. Prominent structural alterations in frontal-striatal circuit dysfunction were evidenced by synaptodendritic alterations in pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, the EcoHIV rat affords a biological system to model how the frontal-striatal circuit responds to HIV-1 infection following chronic drug use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying the Neural Correlates of Balance Deficits in Traumatic Brain Injury using the Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC) analysis</a></h4>

              
                Balance impairment or the loss of balance control is one of the most debilitating consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The levels of balance impairment may not be necessarily associated with the severity level of TBI, which makes it more difficult to do the correlational analysis of the balance impairment and its neural underpinnings. Therefore, we conducted a study where we collected the neurophysiological data (EEG and EMG) during a balance control task on a computerized posturography platform in a group of 17 TBIs and 15 age-matched healthy controls. Further, to distinguish balance-impaired TBIs (BI-TBI) from non-impaired TBIs (BN-TBI), we stratified the level of balance impairment using the Berg Balance Scale, a functional outcome measure widely used in both research and clinical settings. We computed the brain functional connectivity features between different cortical regions of interest using the imaginary part of coherence in different frequency bands. These features are then studied in a mean-centered Partial Least Squares Correlation analysis, which is a data-driven framework with the advantage of handling more features than the number of samples, thus making it suitable for a small-sample study. Based on the nonparametric significance testing using permutation and bootstrap procedure, we noticed that theta-band connectivity strength in the following ROIs significantly contributed to distinguishing balance impaired from non-impaired population: left middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus, right precentral gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left post-central gyrus, right paracentral lobule. The knowledge of specific neural regions associated with balance impairment helps better understand neural mechanisms of TBI-associated balance dysfunction and may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted noninvasive brain stimulation. Our future studies will investigate the effects of balance platform training on sensorimotor connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generating parallel representations of position and identity in the olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                Sex pheromones are key social signals in most animals. In Drosophila a dedicated olfactory channel senses a male pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) that promotes female courtship while repelling males. Here we show that flies use separate cVA processing streams to extract qualitative and positional information. cVA olfactory neurons are sensitive to concentration differences in a 5 mm range around a male. Second-order projection neurons detect inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, encoding the angular position of a male. We identify a circuit mechanism increasing left-right contrast through an interneuron which provides contralateral inhibition. At the third layer of the circuit we identify neurons with distinct response properties and sensory integration motifs. One population is selectively tuned to an approaching male with speed-dependent responses. A second population responds tonically to a male's presence and controls female mating decisions. A third population integrates a male taste cue with cVA; only a simultaneous presentation of both signals promotes female mating via this pathway. Thus the olfactory system generates a range of complex percepts in discrete populations of central neurons that allow the expression of appropriate behaviors depending on context. Such separation of olfactory features resembles the mammalian what and where visual streams.

                Opioid discontinuation generates a withdrawal syndrome marked by a negative emotional state. Increased anxiety and dysphoria during opioid discontinuation are a significant barrier to achieving long-term abstinence in opioid-dependent individuals. Adaptations in brain-reward circuitry are implicated in the opioid abstinence syndrome, but current knowledge is limited to changes following natural and semi-synthetic opioids. Here we report abstinence from the synthetic opioid fentanyl engenders structural, functional, and molecular plasticity in nucleus accumbens neuron subtypes (MSNs) that mediate negative emotional behaviors. We show fentanyl abstinence causes dendritic atrophy and increased excitatory drive exclusive to D1-receptor containing MSNs. Using subtype specific RNAseq and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, we identified molecular signatures of fentanyl abstinence in MSN subtypes. We found a network of co-expressed genes downregulated selectively in D1-MSNs, and transcriptionally co-regulated by E2F1. We show targeting abstinence-induced molecular changes protects D1-MSNs from maladaptive plasticity and alleviates negative emotional behaviors after fentanyl abstinence.

                Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from >500 single GC neurons in mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which spike rate and spike timing or phase relative to licks are used by coding neurons in distinguishing tastes. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further significant finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish between tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction of Stroke Outcome in Mice Based on Non-Invasive MRI and Behavioral Testing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prediction of post-stroke outcome using the degree of subacute deficit or magnetic resonance imaging metrics is well studied in humans. While mice are the most commonly used animals in pre-clinical stroke research, systematic analysis of outcome predictors is lacking. Methods: Data from a total of 13 studies that included 45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion on 148 mice were pooled. Motor function was measured using a modified protocol for the staircase test of skilled reaching. Phases of subacute and residual deficit were defined. Magnetic resonance images of stroke lesions were co-registered on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to characterize stroke topology. Different random forest prediction models that either used motor-functional deficit or imaging parameters were generated for the subacute and residual deficits. Results: We detected both a subacute and residual motor-functional deficit after stroke in mice. Different functional severity grades and recovery trajectories could be observed. We found that lesion volume is the best predictor of subacute deficit. The residual deficit can be predicted most accurately by the degree of the subacute deficit. When using imaging parameters for the prediction of the residual deficit, including information about the lesion topology increases prediction accuracy. A subset of anatomical regions within the ischemic lesion have an outstanding impact on the prediction of long-term outcome. Prediction accuracy depends on the degree of functional impairment. Conclusions: For the first time, we identified and characterized predictors of post-stroke outcome in a large cohort of mice and found strong concordance with clinical data. In the future, using outcome prediction can improve the design of pre-clinical studies and guide intervention decisions.

                Sleep oscillations provide a key substrate to facilitate memory processing, the underlying mechanism of which may involve the overnight homeostatic regulation of plasticity at a synaptic and whole-network level. However, there remains a lack of human data demonstrating if and how sleep enhances memory consolidation and associated neural homeostasis. We combined intracranial recordings and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in humans to reveal a new role for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in promoting the homeostatic recalibration of optimal excitation/inhibition-balance. Moreover, the extent of this REM-sleep homeostatic recalibration predicted the success of overnight memory consolidation, expressly the modulation of hippocampal-neocortical excitability favoring remembering rather than forgetting. The findings describe a novel, fundamental role of human REM sleep in maintaining neural homeostasis thereby enhancing long-term memory

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Medial temporal lobe structure, mnemonic and perceptual discrimination in healthy older adults and those at risk for mild cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive tests sensitive to the integrity of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), such as mnemonic discrimination of perceptually similar stimuli, may be useful early markers of risk for cognitive decline in older populations. Perceptual discrimination of stimuli with overlapping features also relies on MTL, but remains relatively unexplored in this context. We assessed mnemonic discrimination in two test formats (Forced Choice, Yes/No) and perceptual discrimination of objects and scenes in 111 community-dwelling older adults at different risk status for cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological screening. We also investigated associations between performance and MTL subregion volume and thickness. The at-risk group exhibited reduced entorhinal thickness and impaired perceptual and mnemonic discrimination. Perceptual discrimination impairment partially explained group differences in mnemonic discrimination and correlated with entorhinal thickness. Executive dysfunction accounted for Yes/No deficits in at-risk adults, demonstrating the importance of test format for the interpretation of memory decline. These results suggest that perceptual discrimination tasks may be useful tools for detecting incipient cognitive impairment related to reduced MTL integrity in non-clinical populations.

	<p>Purpose: Neuropathic pain often originates from nerve injury or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system. However, its specific pathogenesis remains unclear. The requirement for excitatory synaptic plasticity in pain-related syndromes has been demonstrated. A recent study reported that pentraxin-3 is important in glutamatergic synaptic formation and function. Meanwhile, nectin-1 mediates synaptogenesis in neurological disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate whether pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 modulate spinal nerve damage-related neuropathic pain in male mice. Methods: L4 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in male mice was performed to induce experimental neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia following SNL were based on paw withdrawal (PW) threshold and PW latency, respectively. Spinal pentraxin-3 levels and nectin-1 expression following SNL were examined. Pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 knockdown models were established by the shRNA method. These models were used with a recombinant pentraxin-3 cell model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SNL. Results: The SNL operation generated persistent decreases in mechanical PW threshold and thermal PW latency, with subsequent long-lasting elevations in spinal pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 expression levels. Pentraxin-3 knockdown reduced SNL-associated neuropathic pain behaviors as well as nectin-1 amounts in the spinal dorsal horn. Nectin-1 deficiency impaired mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia following spinal nerve injury. The application of recombinant pentraxin-3 in the spinal cord triggered an acute nociception phenotype and induced spinal overexpression of nectin-1. The intrathecal knockdown of nectin-1 prevented exogenous pentraxin-3-evoked pain hypersensitivity. Conclusions: The findings suggest spinal pentraxin-3 is required for SNL-triggered neuropathic pain via nectin-1 upregulation in male mice.</p>

	<p>Perception of the same narrative can vary between individuals depending on a listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s previous experiences. We studied whether and how cultural family background may shape the processing of an audiobook in the human brain. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 48 healthy volunteers from two different cultural family backgrounds listened to an audiobook depicting the intercultural social life of young adults with the respective cultural backgrounds. Shared cultural family background increased inter-subject correlation of hemodynamic activity in the left-hemispheric Heschl&amp;amp;rsquo;s gyrus, insula, superior temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, in the right-hemispheric lateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortices as well as in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus and precuneus. Thus, cultural family background is reflected in multiple areas of speech processing in the brain and may also modulate visual imagery. After neuroimaging, the participants listened to the narrative again and, after each passage, produced a list of words that had been on their minds when they heard the audiobook during neuroimaging. Cultural family background was reflected as semantic differences in these word lists as quantified by a word2vec-generated semantic model. Our findings may depict enhanced mutual understanding between persons who share similar cultural family backgrounds.</p>

<p>Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging-derived myelin volume fraction, we showed gray matter alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Our findings suggested extensive neuroinflammation, along with a lesser extent demyelination and neuronal loss in RRMS. In contrast, we observed substantial neuronal loss with no evidence of demyelination and neuroinflammation in NMOSD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Herein, we combined neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) to evaluate the spatial distribution and extent of gray matter (GM) microstructural alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The NODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index [ODI], and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and SyMRI (myelin volume fraction [MVF]) measures were compared between age- and sex-matched groups of 30 patients with RRMS (6 males and 24 females; mean age, 51.43¬†¬±¬†8.02¬†years), 18 patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD (2 males and 16 females; mean age, 52.67¬†¬±¬†16.07¬†years), and 19 healthy controls (6 males and 13 females; mean age, 51.47¬†¬±¬†9.25¬†years) using GM-based spatial statistical analysis. Patients with RRMS showed reduced NDI and MVF and increased ODI and ISOVF, predominantly in the limbic and paralimbic regions, when compared with healthy controls, while only increases in ODI and ISOVF were observed when compared with NMOSD. Compared to NDI and MVF, the changes in ODI and ISOVF were observed more widely, including in the cerebellar cortex. These abnormalities were associated with disease progression and disability. In contrast, patients with NMOSD only showed reduced NDI mainly in the cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic cortices when compared with healthy controls and patients with RRMS. Taken together, our study supports the notion that GM pathologies in RRMS are distinct from those of NMOSD. However, owing to the limitations of the study, the results should be cautiously interpreted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients suffer from a cognitive and memory dysfunction. Because the hippocampus plays a key role in both cognition and memory, we tested for volumetric differences in the subfields of the hippocampus in ME/CFS. We estimated hippocampal subfield volumes for 25 ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria only (ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>), 18 ME/CFS patients who met the stricter ICC criteria (ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub>), and 25 healthy controls (HC). Group comparisons with HC detected extensive differences in subfield volumes in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> but not in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>. ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients had significantly <i>larger</i> volume in the left subiculum head (<i>p</i>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001), left presubiculum head (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.0020), and left fimbria (<i>p</i>¬†=¬†0.004). Correlations of hippocampus subfield volumes with clinical measures were stronger in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> than in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients. In ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients, we detected positive correlations between fatigue and hippocampus subfield volumes and a negative correlation between sleep disturbance score and the right CA1 body volume. In ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients, we detected a strong negative relationship between fatigue and left hippocampus tail volume. Strong negative relationships were also detected between pain and SF36 physical scores and two hippocampal subfield volumes (left: GC-ML-DG head and CA4 head). Our study demonstrated that volumetric differences in hippocampal subfields have strong statistical inference for patients meeting the ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> case definition and confirms hippocampal involvement in the cognitive and memory problems of ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients.</p>

<p><i>Bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) mutant mice were validated as a model of Kabuki syndrome as they were more susceptible to infections. Juvenile <i>bapa</i> mice also presented dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Juvenile control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted a novel vocalization pattern: 31-kHz.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The recessive mutant mouse <i>bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Previous studies of our group revealed some behavioral impairments and a mutation in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (Kmt2d) gene. Because mutations in the KMT2D gene in humans are mainly responsible for Kabuki syndrome, this study was proposed to validate <i>bapa</i> mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome. Besides other symptoms, Kabuki syndrome is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and speech impairments, usually diagnosed in the early childhood. Thus, juvenile male and female <i>bapa</i> mice were studied in different developmental stages (prepubertal period and puberty). To induce sickness behavior and to study infection susceptibility responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used. To study oral communication, ultrasonic vocalizations were evaluated. Behavioral (open-field test) and central (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) evaluations were also performed. Control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted 31-kHz ultrasounds on prepubertal period when exploring a novel environment, a frequency not yet described for mice, being defined as 31-kHz exploratory vocalizations. Males, LPS, and puberty inhibited these vocalizations. <i>Bapa</i> mice presented increased motor/exploratory behaviors on prepubertal period due to increased striatal TH expression, revealing striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Combining open-field behavior and GFAP expression, <i>bapa</i> mice did not develop LPS tolerance, that is, they remained expressing signs of sickness behavior after LPS challenge, being more susceptible to infectious/inflammatory processes. It was concluded that <i>bapa</i> mice is a robust experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

<p>This dynamic functional connectivity (FC) study suggests that adolescent depression is characterized by unstable network dynamic pattern, altered state transition metrics, and disrupted FC in a weakly connected state. Furthermore, mean dwell time in this weakly connected state is associated with disease severity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-na√Øve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states‚Äîa more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

     alt="Childhood trauma exposure and reward processing in healthy adults: A functional neuroimaging study"/>
<p>Childhood abuse was associated with increased ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and income. Overall childhood trauma and childhood neglect were not associated with significant activation changes in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation or the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The association between childhood trauma exposure and risk of developing psychopathology may in part be mediated by the effects of chronic stress on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, little is known about the differential effects of distinct trauma types on reward processing, particularly in adults without concurrent medical or psychiatric disorders. We examined the association of childhood trauma exposure, including the differential effects of abuse and neglect, with reward processing in healthy adults (<i>n</i>¬†=¬†114). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was used to assess neural activity in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in relation to reward anticipation and reward outcome, respectively. Exposure to childhood trauma, including abuse and neglect, was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. We found a significant effect for abuse on ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and household monthly income. There were no effects for abuse or neglect, independently or combined, on orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome. Our findings suggest differential effects of childhood abuse on ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation in healthy adults.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including diffuse axonal injury, are influenced by the direction, magnitude, and duration of head acceleration during the injury exposure. Ovine models have been used to study injury mechanics and pathological outcomes of TBI. To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit‚Äìmass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.1‚Äâmm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7¬†¬±‚Äâ1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.2‚Äâmm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

     alt="Serotonin 5-HT7 receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area produces antidepressive effect and affects brain serotonin system in male mice"/>
<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both ‚Äúnormal‚Äù C57Bl/6J and ‚Äúdepressive‚Äù ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in ‚Äúdepressive‚Äù ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is a structure in the midline of the brain that is interconnected with areas associated with stress and feeding. This review highlights the role of the LS in anxiety, depression, and eating disorders and their comorbidity. There is a prevailing view that the LS is anxiolytic. This review finds that the LS is both anxiolytic and anxiogenic. Furthermore, the LS can promote and inhibit feeding. Given these shared roles, the LS represents a common site for the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric disorders, and therefore a potential pharmacological target. This is crucial since currently available treatments are not always effective. Corticotrophin-releasing factor 2 antagonists are potential drugs for the treatment of anxiety and anorexia and require further research. Furthermore, other drugs currently in trials for binge eating, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, may in fact promote food intake. It is hoped that the advancements in chemo- and optogenetic techniques will allow future studies to profile the specific neural connections of the LS and their function. This information could facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and therefore pharmacological targets, of these psychiatric conditions.</p>

     alt="Altered basal ganglia infraslow oscillation and resting functional connectivity in complex regional pain syndrome"/>
<p>This study is the first systematic evaluation of functional connectivity of basal ganglia motor and non-motor territories in CRPS. In CRPS, there is increased ISOs and resting functional connectivity in motor but not in non-motor basal ganglia territories (except caudate body functional connectivity) compared to controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition commonly accompanied by movement disturbances and often affects the upper limbs. The basal ganglia motor loop is central to movement, however, non-motor basal ganglia loops are involved in pain, sensory integration, visual processing, cognition, and emotion. Systematic evaluation of each basal ganglia functional loop and its relation to motor and non-motor disturbances in CRPS has not been investigated. We recruited 15 upper limb CRPS and 45 matched healthy control subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, infraslow oscillations (ISO) and resting-state functional connectivity in motor and non-motor basal ganglia loops were investigated using putamen and caudate seeds. Compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased ISO power in the putamen contralateral to the CRPS affected limb, specifically, in contralateral putamen areas representing the supplementary motor area hand, motor hand, and motor tongue. Furthermore, compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased resting connectivity between these putaminal areas as well as from the caudate body to cortical areas such as the primary motor cortex, supplementary and cingulate motor areas, parietal association areas, and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate changes in basal ganglia loop function in CRPS subjects and may underpin motor disturbances of CRPS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexing the principal gradient of the cerebral cortex to suit changing semantic task demands</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how thought emerges from the topographical structure of the cerebral cortex is a primary goal of cognitive neuroscience. Recent work has revealed a principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity capturing the separation of sensory-motor cortex from transmodal regions of the default mode network (DMN); this is thought to facilitate memory-guided cognition. However, studies have not explored how this dimension of connectivity changes when conceptual retrieval is controlled to suit the context. We used gradient decomposition of informational connectivity in a semantic association task to establish how the similarity in connectivity across brain regions changes during familiar and more original patterns of retrieval. Multivoxel activation patterns at opposite ends of the principal gradient were more divergent when participants retrieved stronger associations; therefore when long-term semantic information is sufficient for ongoing cognition, regions supporting heteromodal memory are functionally separated from sensory-motor experience. In contrast, when less related concepts were linked, this dimension of connectivity was reduced in strength as semantic control regions separated from the DMN to generate more flexible and original responses. We also observed fewer dimensions within the neural response towards the apex of the principal gradient when strong associations were retrieved, reflecting less complex or varied neural coding across trials and participants. In this way, the principal gradient explains how semantic cognition is organised in the human cerebral cortex: the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct population and single-neuron selectivity for executive and episodic processing in human dorsal posterior cingulate</a></h4>

              
                Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is an enigmatic region implicated in psychiatric and neurological disease, yet its role in cognition remains unclear. Human studies link PCC to episodic memory and default mode network (DMN), while findings from the non-human primate emphasize executive processes more associated with the cognitive control network (CCN) in humans. We hypothesized this difference reflects an important functional division between dorsal (executive) and ventral (episodic) PCC. To test this, we utilized human intracranial recordings of population and single unit activity targeting dorsal PCC during an alternated executive/episodic processing task. Dorsal PCC population responses were significantly enhanced for executive, compared to episodic, task conditions, consistent with the CCN. Single unit recordings, however, revealed four distinct functional types with unique executive (CCN) or episodic (DMN) response profiles. Our findings provide critical electrophysiological data from human PCC, bridging incongruent views within and across species, furthering our understanding of PCC function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Status epilepticus induces chronic silencing of burster and dominance of regular firing neurons during sharp wave-ripples in the mouse subiculum</a></h4>

              
                Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal oscillations associated with memory consolidation. The subiculum, as the hippocampal output structure, ensures that hippocampal memory representations are transferred correctly to the consolidating neocortical regions. Because patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often develop memory deficits, we hypothesized that epileptic networks may disrupt subicular SWRs. We therefore investigated the impact of experimentally induced status epilepticus (SE) on subicular SWRs and contributing pyramidal neurons using electrophysiological recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Subicular SWRs expressed hyperexcitable features post-SE, including increased ripple and unit activity. While regular firing neurons normally remain silent during SWRs, selective disinhibition recruited more regular firing neurons for action potential generation during SWRs post-SE. By contrast, burster neurons generated fewer action potential bursts during SWRs post-SE. Furthermore, altered timing of postsynaptic and action potentials suggested distorted neuronal recruitment during SWRs. Distorted subicular SWRs may therefore impair information processing and memory consolidation in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) Facilitates Dendritic Spine Growth of Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The L1 cell adhesion molecule NrCAM (Neuron-glia related cell adhesion molecule) functions as a co-receptor for secreted class 3 Semaphorins to prune subpopulations of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse neocortex. The developing spine cytoskeleton is enriched in actin filaments but a small number of microtubules have been shown to enter the spine apparently trafficking vesicles to the membrane. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a member of the Doublecortin (DCX) family of microtubule-binding proteins with serine/threonine kinase activity. To determine if DCLK1 plays a role in spine remodeling, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse line (Nex1Cre-ERT2: DCLK1flox/flox : RCE) to delete microtubule binding isoforms of DCLK1 from pyramidal neurons during postnatal stages of spine development. Homozygous DCLK1 conditional mutant mice exhibited decreased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (layer 2/3). Mature mushroom spines were selectively decreased upon DCLK1 deletion but dendritic arborization was unaltered. Mutagenesis and binding studies revealed that DCLK1 bound NrCAM at the conserved FIGQY1231 motif in the NrCAM cytoplasmic domain, a known interaction site for the actin-spectrin adaptor Ankyrin. These findings demonstrate that DCLK1 facilitates spine growth and maturation on cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex potentially through microtubule and NrCAM interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of reading and face circuits during the first three years of reading acquisition</a></h4>

              
                Although words and faces activate neighboring regions in the fusiform gyrus, we lack an understanding of how such category selectivity emerges during development. To investigate the organization of reading and face circuits at the earliest stage of reading acquisition, we measured the fMRI responses to words, faces, houses, and checkerboards in three groups of 60 French children: 6-year-old pre-readers, 6-year-old beginning readers and 9-year-old advanced readers. The results showed that specific responses to written words were absent prior to reading, but emerged in beginning readers, irrespective of age. Likewise, specific responses to faces were barely visible in pre-readers and continued to evolve in the 9-year-olds, yet primarily driven by age rather than by schooling. Crucially, the sectors of ventral visual cortex that become specialized for words and faces harbored their own functional connectivity prior to reading acquisition: the VWFA with left-hemispheric spoken language areas, and the FFA with the contralateral region and the amygdalae. The results support the view that reading acquisition occurs through the recycling of a pre-existing but plastic circuit which, in pre-readers, already connects the VWFA site to other distant language areas. We argue that reading acquisition does not compete with the face system directly, through a pruning of preexisting face responses, but indirectly, by hindering the slow growth of face responses in the left hemisphere, thus increasing a pre-existing right hemispheric bias.

	<p>Cognitive control is essential to daily life. Task switching is a classical paradigm used to study cognitive control. Previous researchers have studied the representation of different abstract hierarchical rules in the prefrontal cortex and explored the process mechanisms of task switching. However, the differences between the different hierarchical levels of task switching, especially the related neural mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex, are still unclear. This review focuses on and summarizes this issue. The present study suggests that the higher the hierarchical rule shifting or task switching, the more anterior the activation is on the prefrontal cortex. In addition, a high hierarchy of rules or tasks is more abstract, which leads to a larger switching cost.</p>

	<p>Rhythmic passive movements are often used during rehabilitation to improve physical functions. Previous studies have explored oscillatory activities in the sensorimotor cortex during active movements; however, the relationship between movement rhythms and oscillatory activities during passive movements has not been substantially tested. Therefore, we aimed to quantitatively identify changes in cortical oscillations during rhythmic passive movements. Twenty healthy young adults participated in our study. We placed electroencephalography electrodes over a nine-position grid; the center was oriented on the transcranial magnetic stimulation hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle. Passive movements included elbow flexion and extension; the participants were instructed to perform rhythmic elbow flexion and extension in response to the blinking of 0.67 Hz light-emitting diode lamps. The coherence between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations near the hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle and passive movement rhythms was higher than that between alpha oscillation and passive movement rhythm. These results imply that alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations of the primary motor cortex are differently related to passive movement rhythm.</p>
