                Background Women’s participation in decision-making within Uganda’s logistics sector remains limited despite global and national commitments to gender equality. The logistics industry is largely male-dominated, with women often facing structural and socio-cultural barriers that restrict access to leadership opportunities. Guided by Social Role Theory and Critical Mass Theory, this study explores how the broader industry environment and gender representation dynamics shape women’s engagement in decision-making processes within this sector. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional survey design was employed, targeting professionals from private logistics companies, industry associations, and government regulatory agencies. A total of 298 valid responses were obtained. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in SmartPLS to test hypothesised relationships among industry context, industry gender composition, and women’s engagement in decision-making. Results Findings reveal that both industry context and industry gender composition exert significant and positive effects on women’s engagement in decision-making. Furthermore, industry gender composition mediates the relationship between industry context and women’s engagement, implying that higher female representation within the industry reduces tokenism and legitimises women’s leadership participation. Conclusion The study extends the application of Social Role and Critical Mass Theory to Uganda’s logistics sector, highlighting that structural inclusivity and gender-balanced representation are critical enablers of women’s decision-making participation. The findings practically call for gender-responsive policies, mentorship initiatives, and inclusive recruitment strategies to build a sustainable pipeline of female leaders, thereby advancing national goals of gender equality and inclusive economic development.

                Background This study applied geographical standards (coverage distance) and demographic standards to investigate the capabilities of primary healthcare facilities to cover the largest area of the study area and the service area that can be accessed. This study aimed to determine the number of primary healthcare (PHC) centres required to ensure adequate healthcare coverage for the entire community. Methods Data was obtained by applying geographic information system (GIS) techniques, including proximity analysis, spatial overlay, and network analysis, to analyze primary care facilities using the demographic and geographic standards for primary care facilities. The study was conducted in Sleman District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, using ArcGIS 10.5 and QGIS software for spatial analysis. Results PHC centers cover 79% of the study area according to the geographical standard. The study area needs 41 additional centers to cover the shortfall in service provision per the demographic and geographic standards. Conclusions A significant deficiency in the number of primary care centers found in the study area compared to the large population at the geographical and demographic standards level.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15891">Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16616">The hands of time: Moving my body to keep time order in the brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network of cells, mostly neurons. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest echo to fruitful thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator, or the cogito.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15830">From Minutes to Days: Scaling Intracranial Speech Decoding with Supervised Pretraining</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding speech from brain activity has typically relied on limited neural recordings collected during short and highly controlled experiments. Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.

                arXiv:2512.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12091">Unsupervised discovery of the shared and private geometry in multi-view data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.12091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying complex real-world phenomena often involves data from multiple views (e.g. sensor modalities or brain regions), each capturing different aspects of the underlying system. Within neuroscience, there is growing interest in large-scale simultaneous recordings across multiple brain regions. Understanding the relationship between views (e.g., the neural activity in each region recorded) can reveal fundamental insights into each view and the system as a whole. However, existing methods to characterize such relationships lack the expressivity required to capture nonlinear relationships, describe only shared sources of variance, or discard geometric information that is crucial to drawing insights from data. Here, we present SPLICE: a neural network-based method that infers disentangled, interpretable representations of private and shared latent variables from paired samples of high-dimensional views. Compared to competing methods, we demonstrate that SPLICE 1) disentangles shared and private representations more effectively, 2) yields more interpretable representations by preserving geometry, and 3) is more robust to incorrect a priori estimates of latent dimensionality. We propose our approach as a general-purpose method for finding succinct and interpretable descriptions of paired data sets in terms of disentangled shared and private latent variables.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631">Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.03631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical-circuit data, in which the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method can recover the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as STLSQ, fail to do so with the available data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10011">Spatial Spiking Neural Networks Enable Efficient and Robust Temporal Computation</a></h4>

Abstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.

                arXiv:2512.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neurons, the fundamental information processing units of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), have the all-or-zero information output form that allows SNNs to be more energy-efficient compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the hard reset mechanism employed in spiking neurons leads to information degradation due to its uniform handling of diverse membrane potentials. Furthermore, the utilization of overly simplified neuron models that disregard the intricate biological structures inherently impedes the network's capacity to accurately simulate the actual potential transmission process. To address these issues, we propose a dendrite-soma-axon (DSA) neuron employing the soft reset strategy, in conjunction with a potential change-based perception mechanism, culminating in the change-perceptive dendrite-soma-axon (CP-DSA) neuron. Our model contains multiple learnable parameters that expand the representation space of neurons. The change-perceptive (CP) mechanism enables our model to achieve competitive performance in short time steps utilizing the difference information of adjacent time steps. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the CP-DSA model and the functional characteristics of its internal parameters. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on various datasets substantiate the significant advantages of the CP-DSA model over state-of-the-art approaches.

                arXiv:2512.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can neural networks evolve themselves without relying on external optimizers? We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network. By uniting hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, Self-Referential GHNs mutate and evaluate themselves while adapting mutation rates as selectable traits. Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents.

                arXiv:2512.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by biology, spiking neural networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes over time, offering an energy-efficient alternative to the classical computing paradigm and classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we analyze the representational power of SNNs by viewing them as sequence-to-sequence processors of spikes, i.e., systems that transform a stream of input spikes into a stream of output spikes. We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design. As an application of our results, we discuss spike train classification. Overall, these results contribute to a rigorous foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of spike-based neuromorphic systems.

                arXiv:2512.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) is frequently hypothesized to be the "Holy Grail" of algorithmic trading, promising systems that adapt autonomously to non-stationary market regimes. This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY $>300\%$) and live performance (Capital Decay $>70\%$). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting of \textit{Aleatoric Uncertainty} in low-entropy time-series, the \textit{Survivor Bias} inherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data. Our findings provide empirical evidence that increasing model complexity in the absence of information asymmetry exacerbates systemic fragility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15829">Human-like Working Memory from Artificial Intrinsic Plasticity Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

                arXiv:2512.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.
  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16200">Explicit and Non-asymptotic Query Complexities of Rank-Based Zeroth-order Algorithms on Smooth Functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}{\mu}\log\!\frac{dL}{\mu\delta}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-\delta$ with $0<\delta<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

                arXiv:2512.16445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

                arXiv:2505.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, most spiking neural networks (SNNs) still mimic the chain-like hierarchical architecture in traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). This method significantly differs from random connections between neurons found in biological brains, limiting the ability to model the evolving mechanisms of neural pathways in biological neural systems, particularly in terms of dynamic depth-scalability and adaptive path-plasticity. This paper develops a new modeling paradigm for SNNs with random graph architecture (RGA), termed Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN). Furthermore, we model the depth-scalability and path-plasticity in CogniSNN by introducing a modified spiking residual neural node (ResNode) to counteract network degradation in deeper graph pathways, as well as a critical path-based algorithm that enables CogniSNN to perform path reusability on new tasks leveraging the features of the data and the RGA learned in old tasks. Experiments show that the performance of CogniSNN with redesigned ResNode is comparable, even superior, to current state-of-the-art SNNs on neuromorphic datasets. The critical path-based approach effectively achieves path reuse capability while maintaining expected performance in learning new tasks that are similar to or distinct from the old ones. This study showcases the potential of RGA-based SNNs and paves a new path for modeling the fusion of computational neuroscience and deep intelligent agents. The code is available at github.com/Yongsheng124/CogniSNN.

                arXiv:2507.16043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surrogate gradient descent algorithm enabled spiking neural networks to be trained to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks, an important step in understanding how spikes contribute to neural computations. However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information (interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes). We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified speech-based datasets.

Abstract: Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

                arXiv:2506.23165v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modelling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyses WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management, the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epidemic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Peer tutoring, a pedagogical approach in which students assist one another in the learning process, has demonstrated strong educational and psychosocial benefits in health professions education. It enhances cognitive development, communication, self-efficacy, and social connectedness. Within nursing education, peer tutoring encourages reflective learning and professional growth. However, limited research has explored its impact within culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Aims This study explored the experiences of nursing student tutors and tutees at the University of Sharjah, evaluating their impact on academic development, emotional resilience, interpersonal connections, and the overall learning experience within a culturally and linguistically diverse population. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with a purposive sampling of 20 undergraduate nursing students (6tutors and12 tutees) at the University of Sharjah. Data were analyzed inductively through thematic content analysis following the COREQ guidelines. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) Tutors’ perspectives and experiences, (2) Tutees’ perspectives and experiences, and (3) Barriers to peer tutoring. Peer tutoring was found to enhance academic comprehension, communication, and confidence, while also fostering collaboration and empathy. Challenges included language barriers, inconsistent commitment, and limited time for relationship building Conclusions Peer tutoring represents an effective, student-centered learning strategy that supports academic success, promotes psychological safety, and nurtures professional competencies among nursing students. Findings underscore the need for structured, institutionally supported peer tutoring programs that address linguistic diversity, ensure tutor preparation, and integrate emotional and cultural sensitivity into nursing curricula.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study analyzed psychosocial predictors of secondary school adolescents between emotional neglect, family dysfunction, parental substance abuse, and their drug use disorders in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods The paper also adopted the descriptive cross-sectional research design within the quantitative research approach. A sample of 275 was drawn from a population size of 965 through multistage sampling techniques. Data collection instruments included a self-developed questionnaire comprising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) for Emotional Neglect Subscale, an adapted Family Assessment Device (FAD), and Parental Substance Abuse Checklist. Five experts validated the instruments: three medical doctors and two secondary school teachers. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, finally used on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) for Emotional Neglect Subscale, was found to be 0.760; data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results The results of the findings reveal that there has not been a day in the past year when they drank more than a few sips of alcohol; also, it shows that the relationship between emotional neglect and drug use disorder among secondary school students is concerning. The study shows that the overall family dysfunction score provides very significant insights about the familial relationships observed among students, and finally, the study shows low parental substance abuse. Conclusions The researchers, therefore, conclude that in the quest to reduce psychosocial factors related to drug use disorder among adolescents, family training on how to avoid emotional neglect should be emphasized. Recommendations Finally, it is recommended that there should be a partnership treatment plan between mental health practitioners, teachers, and policymakers to share insightful information concerning emotional well-being that would help establish more supportive conditions for adolescents.

                Objectives To estimate Global, Regional, and National prevalence of Malnutrition, specifically Coexisting forms of malnutrition (CFM) and its various types: Coexistence of underweight with stunting (CUS), Coexistence of underweight with wasting (CUW), Coexistence of underweight with wasting & stunting (CUWS), Coexistence of stunting with overweight/obesity (CSO) among children under five years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods This cross-sectional observational study utilized latest nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets of 62 LMICs corresponding to six global regions from 2006 to 2024. Data of 541,707 children aged 0 to 59 months with complete anthropometry were analysed descriptively (prevalence estimates) and inferentially (multivariate logistic regression). Results The global malnutrition prevalence among children was 43.9%, of which CFM was observed among 20.9% children. Among various CFM types, CUS was highly prevalent (11.8%), followed by CUW (4.2%), CUWS (3.2%), and CSO (2.1%). South & Southeast Asian had highest CFM prevalence of 29.6%, while Central Asia and Latin America & Caribbean reported the lowest CFM prevalence of 8.1% and 6.2%, respectively. Among all the LMIC included, Timor-Leste exhibited the highest CFM at 41.8%. In general, children aged between 12 to 35 months had 2-3 times higher odds of various forms of CFM. However, female sex, maternal education, improvement in socioeconomic status, medium to large family size showed significantly lower odds with various forms of CFM. Conclusions This study advances the understanding of CFM’s prevalence, determinants, and regional variations, filling a critical gap in global nutrition research. The findings serve as a reminder to reinvest in efforts to protect children from malnutrition during their early years of life. Governments and other global health sector must invest in a well-established system of nutrition surveillance for addressing CFM, informing targeted interventions to improve child health outcomes in LMICs.

                In a context where teaching electrochemistry concepts requires pedagogical approaches capable of fostering student understanding and supporting their situational interest, this study aimed to examine the effect of teaching based on numerical simulation on students’ situational interest and academic performance. It involved 1,020 secondary school students. The sample was divided into an experimental group and a control group. A pre-test and a post-test were administered to assess the impact of this intervention on student performance. The main results are: a comparison of the pre-test and post-test results showed a significant improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group compared to the control group. A Student’s t-test for independent samples revealed a significant difference between the two groups, t(1018) = 2.643, p = 0.008, indicating that the experimental group achieved significantly greater improvements than the control group. A comparison of incorrect answers between the two groups revealed a decrease in misconceptions in the experimental group. The IS2G scale was used to measure situational interest. A mixed-variance analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between time and group, F(1) = 27.11, p ≤ 0.001, and η2p = 0.026. This indicates that the use of simulation led to increased interest among the students who participated in this intervention. In conclusion, the use of interactive numerical simulations represents a promising approach to facilitate the learning of electrochemistry and stimulate student interest.

                <p>Olfaction is the dominant sensory modality in rodents. It can be used to assess behavioral phenomena including stress, learning and memory, and social investigation, and impaired olfaction is implicated in several neurological disorders. Paradigms such as the olfactory habituation/dishabituation (OHD) task can assess olfactory perception, memory, and motivation. However, these tasks require manual stimulus presentation, introducing variability and making them labor-intensive. Olfactometers allow automated stimulus delivery, but the OHD task has not yet been adapted for use with an olfactometer. Additionally, current olfactometer designs require proprietary software or components that are difficult to obtain/fabricate and commercial units are expensive. As a result, these apparatuses have not been widely implemented. Here, we describe the design and assembly of the Odor Delivery Optimization Research System (ODORS), an economical, modular, and open-source olfactometer for use in rodents, and describe a variant of the OHD task that can be automated using this apparatus. The design is based on five principles: (1) familiar layout and function; (2) use of inexpensive, readily available components; (3) easily integrated, modular design; (4) real-time assessment of odorant levels; and (5) the ability to test tethered and untethered rodents in optogenetic and electrophysiological experiments. Male and female C57BL/6NCrl mice performing OHD in the ODORS exhibit the characteristic habituation to repeated presentations of an odor and dishabituation to the first presentation of a novel odor. As a result, we suggest that the ODORS makes improved olfactory testing accessible to many labs and offers a major refinement over existing OHD testing paradigms.</p>

                Introduction The brachial plexus block is one of the most commonly used anaesthesia techniques for upper limb surgeries. The supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBB) has been a frequently performed technique because it provides excellent quality of blockade, faster onset, and dense blockade. Different adjuvants and local anaesthetics are used to improve the onset and quality of the blockade. In our study, the local anaesthetic used was 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the adjuvants used were buprenorphine and nalbuphine. Materials and Methods Our study, a randomised, prospective double-blinded investigation, was conducted on 60 patients scheduled for elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries. We performed the Supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 25 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine plain (Group L) or with buprenorphine (Group LB) or with nalbuphine (Group LN) as adjuvants. We recorded the onset, duration of blockade (motor and sensory), sedation score, and time for rescue analgesia. Results The onset of sensorimotor blockade was notably faster in Group LB than in Group LN or Group L. The sensorimotor blockade duration was significantly prolonged in Group LB compared to LN and L. Group LB also had a delayed time after 12 hrs for rescue analgesia compared to the other two groups. Conclusion Buprenorphine as an adjuvant to 0.5% levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly shortens the onset of sensorimotor blockade and enhances the duration of blockade when compared to nalbuphine. Both the adjuvants delayed the time for request of rescue analgesia compared to plain levobupivacaine.

                Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder that can lead to disability and mortality in adults. The management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires the ability to predict functional outcomes. Blood biomarkers are valuable prognostic tools because of their rapid assessment, cost-effectiveness, and clinical accessibility. Given that Neurogranin (Ng) is a small postsynaptic neural protein, and when the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is damaged, Ng levels are altered in the bloodstream. Methods This study aimed to assess the concentration of Ng in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We investigated forty-six thrombotic patients, forty-five embolic patients, and forty-five healthy individuals. Serum concentrations of Ng, D-dimer, random blood sugar (RBS), lipid profile, renal function tests, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte tests were performed for all participants. Results The results revealed that the embolic group had the highest serum level of Ng compared to the thrombotic and control groups (0.600±0.339 ng/ml, 0.464±0.121 ng/ml, and 0.304±0.065 ng/ml, respectively). Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that serum Ng was positively correlated with some biomarker parameters, specifically platelets, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the embolic group. Meanwhile, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis yielded area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.879 vs. 0.897 for the thrombotic and embolic groups, respectively. Conclusion These results led us to conclude that the assessment of serum Ng levels suggests that it can be used as a successful diagnostic parameter for ischemic stroke patients during the early stages of the disease.

                The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, into academic research is accelerating. While these tools offer considerable utility for professional doctorate students, especially those engaged in practice-based, qualitative inquiry, their use also presents serious epistemological, ethical, and pedagogical challenges. This article critically examines the promise and limitations of AI in the context of professional doctorates, with a specific focus on qualitative research. Drawing from recent scholarship, it highlights how overreliance on AI can bypass crucial aspects of intellectual development, compromise reflexivity, and obscure researcher accountability. This paper argues for a principled and transparent use of AI, guided by structured frameworks, to ensure that the human researcher remains central to meaning-making and scholarly authorship. The proposed stance foregrounds epistemic agency and underscores the importance of learning through complexity and discomfort in the doctoral journey.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1410/v1?src=rss">Beyond Philanthropy: A Systematic Review of CSR as a Strategic Driver of Financial Performance in Commercial Banking [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global commercial banking sector is under increasing pressure to integrate Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into its core strategies. This shift is driven by evolving regulatory frameworks, heightened stakeholder expectations, and a growing recognition of sustainability’s impact on long-term viability. However, empirical evidence on the CSR-financial performance (FP) relationship remains fragmented and often contradictory, creating a critical knowledge gap for practitioners and scholars alike. Methods This systematic literature review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizes the most recent evidence (2022-2025). A comprehensive search of Scopus-indexed databases identified relevant studies. The review employed a convergent synthesis approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative findings through thematic analysis and effect size calculations. Study quality was appraised using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with 85% of the included studies meeting high-quality thresholds. Results The synthesis indicates a predominantly positive, though context-dependent, association between CSR and financial performance. Meta-analytical findings show moderate positive correlations with key profitability indicators, including return on assets (r = 0.34) and return on equity (r = 0.29). A significant finding is CSR’s pronounced role in risk mitigation, evidenced by a negative correlation with non-performing loans (r = -0.26) and enhanced resilience during market volatility. The relationship is strongly moderated by institutional factors: bank size, regulatory environment, and geographic context. Crucially, the depth of strategic integration was a key differentiator, with substantive, authentic CSR implementations yielding significantly greater financial benefits than symbolic approaches. Conclusion This review provides a contemporary synthesis of the CSR-FP nexus in commercial banking, offering three principal contributions: it identifies key moderators that explain contradictory findings in prior literature; it documents risk mitigation as a fundamental mechanistic pathway linking CSR to financial outcomes. The findings offer evidence-based guidance for banking executives and policymakers to navigate the complex landscape of sustainable finance effectively.

                <p>by Rohit Kumar Singh, Pinaki Swain, Mahipal Ganji, Sandeep Choubey</p>

The compaction of DNA by phase-separating, DNA-binding proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for organizing chromatin and shaping genome architecture. Although experimental studies have provided insights into the governing principles of such protein-mediated DNA compaction, the effect of DNA sequence remains unclear. Here, guided by experimental observations, we present a simple polymer-based model of protein-mediated DNA compaction that explicitly accounts for sequence-dependent protein binding. Using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, in the case of a homogeneous DNA, only one condensate forms in equilibrium. In sharp contrast, DNA sequence heterogeneity can result in the coexistence of multiple condensates. Interestingly, we find that interfacial DNA binding affinity controls capillary forces generated by protein-DNA condensates, offering a potential mechanism to regulate chromatin structure and 3D genome organization. To demonstrate the usefulness of our modeling framework, we compare the simulation results against published data for the compaction of DNA via Dps, Sox2, and HP1. We find that DNA sequence dictates the compaction of Sox2 and HP1 with DNA. Overall, our framework provides mechanistic insights into how DNA sequence affects protein-mediated DNA compaction and paves the way for developing a deeper understanding of genome organization.

Cancer cells undergo extensive metabolic rewiring to support growth, survival, and phenotypic plasticity. A non-canonical variant of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, characterized by mitochondrial-to-cytosolic citrate export, has emerged as critical for embryonic stem cell differentiation. However, its role in cancer remains poorly understood.
Here, we present a two-step computational framework to systematically analyze the activity of this non-canonical TCA cycle across over 500 cancer cell lines and investigate its role in shaping hallmarks of malignancy. First, we applied constraint-based modeling to infer cycle activity, defining two complementary metrics: <i>Cycle Propensity</i>, measuring the likelihood of its engagement in each cell line, and <i>Cycle Flux Intensity</i>, quantifying average flux through the reaction identified as rate-limiting. We identified distinct tumor-specific patterns of pathway utilization. Notably, cells with high <i>Cycle Propensity</i> preferentially reroute cytosolic citrate via aconitase 1 (ACO1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), promoting α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and NADPH production. Elevated engagement of this cycle strongly correlated with Warburg-like metabolic shifts, including decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate secretion.
In the second step, to uncover non-metabolic transcriptional signatures associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, we performed machine learning–based feature selection using ElasticNet and XGBoost, identifying robust gene signatures predictive of cycle activity. Over-representation analysis revealed enrichment in genes involved in metastatic behavior, angiogenesis, stemness, and key oncogenic signaling. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) further prioritized genes with the strongest predictive contributions, highlighting candidates for experimental validation. Correlation analysis of DepMap gene-dependency profiles revealed distinct vulnerability patterns associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, outlining a characteristic landscape of genetic dependencies.
Together, our integrative framework uniting constraint-based metabolic modeling and machine learning systematically reveals how non-canonical TCA cycle dynamics underpin metabolic plasticity and promote malignant traits.

                <p>by Emma L. Fairbanks, Matthew Baylis, Janet M. Daly, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

Vector-borne disease transmission involves complex interactions between vectors, reservoir hosts and dead-end hosts. We present a mathematical model for the vectorial capacity that incorporates multiple host types and their interactions, focusing specifically on West Nile virus transmission by <i>Culex pipiens</i> mosquitoes. Our model integrates climate-dependent parameters affecting vector biology with vector control interventions to predict transmission potential under various scenarios. We demonstrate how vector control interventions targeting one host type can significantly impact transmission dynamics across all host populations. By examining the effects of different vector control tool modes of action (repellency, preprandial killing, disarming and postprandial killing), we develop target product profiles that minimise unintended consequences of vector control. Notably, we identify the optimal intervention characteristics needed to prevent repellency on dead-end hosts from inadvertently increasing transmission among reservoir hosts. This research provides valuable insights for public health officials designing targeted vector control strategies and offers a flexible modelling framework that can be adapted to other vector-borne diseases with complex host dynamics.

Vertebrate neural circuit properties are shaped by synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). CAMs often have multiple paralogs but the possible redundancy of such paralogs remains underexplored. Using circuit-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice deficient for Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, we show that these paralogs lack specific laminar expression in mature hippocampal neurons but divergently guide the specificity of neural circuits in distinct hippocampal subfields. Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 regulate distinct facets of excitatory synaptic properties in a microcircuit-dependent manner through binding to LAR-RPTPs, and additionally in the case of Slitrk2, through binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins and TrkB. Analyses of Slitrk2 V89M knock-in mice revealed that this schizophrenia-associated substitution acts uniquely as a loss-of-function mutation in some microcircuits to impair excitatory synaptic transmission, asynchronous release, and spatial reference memory. These findings demonstrate that even structurally and biochemically similar synaptic CAMs can play distinct roles in specifying neural circuit architecture.

                <p>by Nick D. Pokorzynski, Elisabeth C. Sams-Dodd, Christopher Esneault, Katarina A. Jones, Shawn R. Campagna, Eduardo A. Groisman</p>

The intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium confronts cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation inside macrophages. This stress alters carbon metabolism and subverts canonical carbon source preferences by reducing synthesis of 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the essential allosteric activator of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), master regulator of carbon utilization. How, then, does <i>S.</i> Typhimurium preferentially utilize CRP-cAMP-dependent carbon sources inside macrophages? We now report that the virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis regulator PhoP controls CRP-cAMP-dependent transcription, metabolism, and growth on a mixture of carbon sources during low cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We determine that the PhoP-activated MgtA and MgtB proteins promote CRP-cAMP activity by importing Mg<sup>2+</sup>, indispensable cofactor of the cAMP-synthesizing adenylate cyclase CyaA. Significantly, the PhoP-activated MgtC preserves cAMP amounts despite reducing abundance of CyaA substrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) because ATP at high concentrations inhibits CyaA. Restoring CRP activity by supplementation of cAMP or introduction of the constitutively active <i>crp*</i> allele corrected CRP-dependent transcriptional and growth behaviors of the <i>mgtA mgtB</i> mutant. By controlling cAMP synthesis, PhoP dictates the amounts of active CRP, thereby reprogramming <i>S.</i> Typhimurium’s metabolism.

                <p>by Sneh Harsh, Hsiao-Yun Liu, Pradeep K. Bhaskar, Christine Rushlow, Erika A. Bach</p>

Maintenance of somatic sex identity is essential for adult tissue function. In the <i>Drosophila</i> testis, adult somatic stem cells known as cyst stem cells (CySCs) require the transcription factor Chinmo to preserve male identity. Loss of Chinmo leads to reprogramming of CySCs into their ovarian counterparts through induction of the female-specific RNA-binding protein Transformer<sup>F</sup> (Tra<sup>F</sup>), though the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we identify the pioneer transcription factor Zelda (Zld) as a critical mediator of this sex reversal. In wild-type CySCs, <i>zld</i> mRNA is repressed by microRNAs (miRs), but following Chinmo loss, these miRs are downregulated, allowing <i>zld</i> mRNA to be translated. Zld is necessary for feminization of <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs, and ectopic expression of Zld in wild-type CySCs is sufficient to induce Tra<sup>F</sup> and drive female reprogramming. Two Zld target genes, <i>qkr58E-2</i> and <i>Ecdysone receptor</i> (<i>EcR</i>), are upregulated in <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs and are normally female-biased in adult gonads. Qkr58E-2 facilitates Tra<sup>F</sup> production, while EcR promotes female gene expression programs. Zld overexpression feminizes otherwise wild-type CySCs by upregulating EcR, which in turn downregulates the <i>chinmo</i> gene. Strikingly, overexpression of Zld also feminizes adult male adipose tissue by inducing Tra<sup>F</sup> and downregulating Chinmo, indicating that Zld can override male identity in multiple adult XY tissues. Together, these findings uncover a post-transcriptional mechanism in which miRs-mediated repression of a pioneer factor safeguards male identity and prevents inappropriate activation of the female program in adult somatic cells.

                <p>by Margaret Morash, Richard G. Kay, Erik J. Soderblom, Grace H. MacLean, Jia Wen, Peyton J. Moore, Colin R. Lickwar, Mujahid Ali Shah, Julia Ganz, Fiona M. Gribble, Frank Reimann, Rodger A. Liddle, John F. Rawls</p>

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are rare sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that coordinate digestive physiology by secreting a diverse repertoire of peptide hormones. These hormones are the main effectors of EEC function, and their characterization requires direct observation by mass spectrometry due to the specialized protein cleavage and posttranslational modifications that yield their mature forms. Based on the distinct subset of hormones they predominantly secrete, EECs can be categorized into subtypes. How each EEC subtype is specified, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe EEC subtype differentiation and hormone production in the zebrafish. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified EEC progenitors and six EEC subtypes in zebrafish and revealed that their expression profiles are consistent across larval and adult stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of isolated zebrafish EECs identified highly processed peptides derived from 19 of 23 hormone-coding genes expressed by EECs, including a previously undescribed zebrafish <i>secretin</i> ortholog. We assembled reporters for zebrafish EEC subtypes to test the lineage relationships between EEC subtypes and the EEC progenitor population, which expresses <i>neurogenin 3 (neurog3)</i>. Despite its essential role in mammalian EEC differentiation, we found that selective cytotoxic ablation of <i>neurog3</i>+ cells in zebrafish only reduced a subset of EEC subtypes and loss of the <i>neurog3</i> gene had no impact on EEC numbers. Finally, we discovered that selective ablation of <i>ghrelin</i>+ EECs reduced a different subset of EEC subtypes, together suggesting that <i>neurog3</i>+ and <i>ghrelin</i>+ cells serve as distinct precursors for separate EEC subtypes. We anticipate these observations and resources will facilitate future studies in the zebrafish to discern the developmental biology, physiology, and endocrinology of EEC subtypes.

                Background Recommender systems have become inherent in personalizing experiences, especially digital experiences, across domains such as e-commerce, media, and entertainment. These systems use the user to item interactions data (how an user reacts to an item) to identify patterns that predict preference and rank content. Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used approaches, relying on similarity between users or items to generate recommendations. Methods This study examines collaborative filtering using similarity metrics applied to a curated IMDB movie dataset. Data was preprocessed using merging metadata and ratings, encoding categorical fields, and constructing feature vectors for each movie. The primary metric to compute pairwise distances between items was Cosine similarity. An item-item recommendation engine was then created and implemented, and the output was evaluated using a movie example (the Saw 2004). Results The system produced coherent recommendations aligned with the genre and thematic characteristics of the input movie used, Saw (2004). The top-ranked films exhibited high cosine similarity scores, indicating strong vector space proximity and consistent user engagement patterns. Visual exploration of the data confirmed that the similarity-based approach captured meaningful behavioral relationships. Conclusions The findings show that a simple similarity-based collaborative filtering model can effectively identify related movies without complex model architectures. Even with lightweight feature engineering, the system generated relevant recommendations that mirror typical user preferences. This demonstrates the practicality of similarity-based methods for scalable and interpretable recommendation tasks, and highlights opportunities for future extensions using hybrid or embedding based models.

                Background The shipbuilding and ship-repair industries are important contributors to world trade. However, it also generates various types of waste, similar to any other industry, which has a detrimental impact on the environment. This study aims to understand the critical need for effective and appropriate waste management practices in this industry by investigating the factors involved in generating various types of waste. It identifies and ranks the major challenges in waste management in this industry. The study also suggests potential solutions for shipyards and repair yards to address these challenges. Methods The study used the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) to prioritize the challenges identified through a literature review and finalized them based on the feedback of experts. Further, a list of solutions for these challenges was prepared based on interviews with experts in this area. Finally, the Best Worst Method (BWM) was used to rank the solutions for each of the identified challenges. Results The findings indicate that the major challenges for the industry are the generation of hazardous waste and the high costs involved in adopting sustainable practices. The results also showed that strict waste segregation and containment are the top solutions to handle the challenge of hazardous waste generation. Further, the leverage on external funding mechanisms and implementation in a phase-wise manner are the top two solutions to deter the challenge of high costs associated with adopting sustainable practices. Conclusions By prioritizing these challenges and solutions, this study provides a road map for shipyards around the world to effectively allocate resources, improve environmental performance, meet regulations, and improve operational performance. This is important for the adoption of an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable shipbuilding and repair industry.

                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (= (1– ν 2/c 2)-1/2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-661/v4?src=rss">Determinants of urban mosquito population density and community responses: A cross-sectional study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify key environmental and household determinants of mosquito presence in urban Mangalore, to assess household-level prevention practices, and to evaluate community perceptions and self-reported disease burden towards mosquito-borne diseases. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, a teaching and service field area under the Mangalore City Corporation, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results Among 95 respondents (70.5% female and 94.8% literate), 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year, 69.4% recognized the rainy season as the peak period of mosquito activity. Water stagnation [74.7% (95% CI: 64.8–83.1)] and ongoing construction activity [32.4% (95% CI: 21.8–44.1)] emerged as significant environmental determinants of higher mosquito density which was not statistically significant. A large majority of households (91.6%) reported using chemical measures for mosquito prevention, while 92.6% of participants were aware of mosquito-borne diseases. Despite this, nearly one-third (29.4%) of respondents had experienced a mosquito-borne illness in the preceding year, with 71.4% dengue infection. The use of mosquito repellents was paradoxically associated with a higher prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.4–9.6; p = 0.024). Conclusion Although awareness and preventive measure uptake were high, gaps remain in consistent environmental control and municipal interventions. Strengthening local authority action on water stagnation and construction-site management is essential for sustainable vector control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95541">Testosterone-induced metabolic changes in seminal vesicle epithelium modify seminal plasma components with potential to improve sperm motility</a></h4>

              
                Male factors account for almost half of the causes of infertility. In rodents and humans, most of the components of semen are supplied by the seminal vesicles, and they support male reproductive ability, but there are many unknown details. This study focused on metabolic changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and investigated how testosterone affects seminal plasma composition. A factor improving the linear motility of sperm was secreted from the seminal vesicles, and it was produced in an androgen-dependent manner. Bioassays, gene expression, and flux analysis studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells via GLUT4, resulting in fatty acid synthesis. ACLY was a critical factor in this metabolic change, which produced fatty acids, especially oleic acid. In conclusion, the critical role of testosterone-induced metabolic changes in the seminal vesicles is to ensure the synthesis of fatty acids. These findings suggest that testosterone-dependent lipid remodeling may contribute to sperm straight-line motility, and further functional verification is required.

">Neural correlates of implicit memory for reoccurring sound patterns</a></h4>

              
                The human brain exhibits remarkable sensitivity to auditory patterns. Previous research has shown that beyond the detection of such patterns, humans form memories for them that are implicit, robust to interference, and persistent over time. Here, we examine the mechanisms underlying implicit memory formation for reoccurring regular tone patterns using UHF fMRI. Prior to scanning, implicit memory was induced through a standard behavioral task where participants detected regular patterns embedded in random tone sequences. Unbeknownst to participants, five regular patterns reoccurred sporadically (every 1.5 min) across trials. Consistent with previous reports, behavioral performance indicated a reaction time advantage to reoccurring patterns, confirming the formation of implicit memory traces. During passive listening in the scanner, regularity engaged the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, putamen, and hippocampus, a result we interpret as reflecting the higher perceptual precision of regular patterns. Reoccurrence interacted with regularity in the superior temporal gyrus and a frontal cluster, showing higher activity for reoccurring compared to novel regular patterns. The hippocampus showed sensitivity to reoccurrence in both regular and random patterns. Together, these results indicate that the neocortex may selectively amplify reoccurring inputs in line with their enhanced (memory driven) perceptual precision.

">A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Perceptual Segmentation of Natural Scenes In Autism</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how individuals segment complex natural scenes into perceptual segments is essential for explaining both typical and atypical sensory processing. In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.

">Glucodynamic Network Transitions of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Variability in neuronal firing patterns enables the brain to flexibly transition between network states, a hallmark of adaptive information processing. Yet the energetic basis of this flexibility remains unknown. Here, we report that the capacity of the brain to shift between network states is contingent on the moment-to-moment variability of glucose metabolism. Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures. These findings reveal that functional network dynamics are emergent properties of the brain's metabolic architecture and that the organisation of large-scale neural circuits is constrained by energetic principles. This understanding may provide critical new insights into the metabolic basis of brain ageing, neurodegeneration and psychiatric conditions.

">Slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow enables axon and dendrite development and maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Distinct microtubule arrays form in axons and dendrites defining their functions in neurons. These arrays are thought to develop through separate processes. Here we challenge this view by showing that axons and dendrites develop by a unifying process: slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow (MT-RF), a recently discovered mechanism of microtubule dynamics. By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules. Thus, our data-integrated model reveals MT-RF slowdown as central for the development of distinct neuronal compartments, providing a unifying mechanism for microtubule-related physiology.

">Altered Frontoparietal, Temporal and Sensorimotor Structure-Function Coupling and Its Genetic Underpinnings in Bipolar Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Structure-function coupling quantifies how strongly structural connectivity supports functional communication across brain regions. Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings offer novel insight into the architectural contributions to the pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder.

">Distinct talkers combat catastrophic failures of spatial attention due to interruption</a></h4>

              
                Task-irrelevant features can impact formation of auditory objects and influence the effectiveness of selective attention, including the buildup of attention over time. Using a previously established paradigm exploring the effects of random interruptions on spatial selective attention, this study explores how the task-irrelevant feature of talker identity impacts the buildup of spatial attention and whether it alters the impact of interruptions. Participants performed a sequence recall task in which participants were presented with two competing syllable sequences coming from different spatial directions and were asked to report the syllable sequence coming from the target direction. On half of the trials, an unpredictable, novel interrupting sound occurred, disrupting attentional focus. Two experiments explored how talker influenced performance, specifically, whether 1) making the two streams come from different talkers facilitates task performance and reduces the impact of interruption compared to when the streams are spoken by the same talker, and 2) talker discontinuity interferes with attention buildup and harms syllable recall performance compared to when the talker is the same from one syllable to the next. Our results showed that distinct talker features, though task-irrelevant in this spatial task, significantly improved syllable recall performance and reduced the impact of interrupters. Further, irrelevant talker discontinuities damaged attention buildup and reduced syllable recall performance.

">Pooled versus structured inhibition drives competitive stimulus interactions across distinct spatial scales of the superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Competitive stimulus interactions across the space map in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) are essential for spatial decision-making. Here, with electrophysiological recordings in intermediate and deep layers of the mouse SC (SCid), we discovered that rules and the spatial profiles of these competitive interactions are different between local, within-RF versus global, across-RF-boundary spatial scales. When one visual stimulus was centered in the receptive field (RF) and a second one was located within the RF's classical inhibitory surround, we found that stimulus interactions followed an averaging rule. This classical surround was spatially restricted, and the strength of inhibition underlying these 'within-RF' interactions decreased with distance from the RF center. By contrast, when the second stimulus was located outside the RF, stimulus interactions followed a divisive rule. Strikingly, this extra-classical inhibitory surround was spatially global, and the strength of competitive inhibition underlying these 'across-RF-boundary' interactions was distance-invariant. Computational modeling revealed that whereas within-RF interactions are well-explained by a divisive normalization-like mechanism driven by pooled inhibition, across-RF-boundary interactions are not, and instead, are well-explained by a winner-take-all-like mechanism driven by structured, donut-like inhibition. Combined, our results offer insights into the mechanistic logic of stimulus competition in the SCid, which critically underlies spatial decision-making in mammals.

                The quality of retinal images is compromised by aberrations that remain uncorrected even in confocal adaptive optics imaging. This study demonstrates phase diversity (PD), a computational imaging technique, to address residual aberrations and enhance image quality in adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). By using images of the same object obtained with and without deliberately added aberrations, PD computes and compensates for the effects of existing residual aberrations beyond those corrected by a closed-loop AO system. Experimental validation demonstrates that PD improves visualization of retinal microstructures, including cone mosaics and dendrites of fluorescently labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).

">STING_IFN_CH25H lipid axis links innate immune activation to tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                Genetic risk for Alzheimers disease is strongly enriched in pathways governing microglial activation and cholesterol metabolism, yet how these processes converge to drive neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we identify the oxysterol 25_hydroxycholesterol (25_HC) as a pathogenic lipid downstream of the cGAS_STING_IFN pathway. In models of tau pathology, interferon signaling induces Cholesterol 25_hydroxylase (CH25H) expression in microglia. Ch25h deletion in female P301S mice suppressed tau aggregation, preserved synapses, prevented brain atrophy, and rescued memory. Mechanistically, loss of CH25H disrupted STING trafficking, attenuated IFN activation, dampened self-perpetuating microglial inflammation. Strikingly, 25_HC directly accelerated tau propagation in human iPSC derived neurons. It also disrupted lysosomal and mitochondrial lipid composition, driving cholesteryl ester accumulation and promoting apoptosis under tau-induced stress. These findings define a STING_IFN_CH25H lipid axis that bridges innate immune activation to tau pathology and toxicity, offering a tractable therapeutic pathway for inflammation-driven neurodegenerative conditions.

">Genetic Interaction of APOE-E-4 and PICALM rs3851179 is Associated With Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Healthy Middle-Aged Adults at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which genetic risk variants, including APOE E4 (A+) and the PICALM rs3851179 variant (P+), are linked to altered brain function. Objective: To test whether dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) dwell-time patterns from resting-state fMRI differ by AD genetic risk in cognitively healthy, middle-aged adults. Methods: We estimated recurring dFC clusters from rs-fMRI and computed dwell-time (total time spent in each cluster) for individuals in not-at-risk, A+P-, and A+P+ groups. Group differences in dwell-time profiles were assessed, and logistic regression with permutation testing evaluated the association between dwell-time features and genotype. Results: At-risk groups (A+P-, A+P+) spent less time in left-hemisphere hubs than not-at-risk individuals, consistent with reports of left-hemisphere vulnerability in AD. Logistic regression showed modest above-chance genotype discrimination, with permutation tests indicating a marginal trend when comparing not-at-risk versus at-risk (A+P-, A+P+) groups. Conclusions: Dwell-time features from dFC states show preliminary sensitivity to AD genetic risk and warrant evaluation in larger samples as potential early risk markers.

">The glutamine transporter Slc38a1 is widely expressed in the embryonic neurogenic niches and impacts neuronal volume, survival, and morphology</a></h4>

              
                The amino acid glutamine, and its derivatives glutamate and GABA, are pivotal for neurogenesis. However, how glutamine is mechanistically supplied to the cells in the neurogenic niches and its broader impact on neurodevelopment, remain poorly characterized. The Solute carrier family 38 member 1 (Slc38a1) exhibits high affinity for glutamine and accumulates glutamine in select cells. We investigated whether Slc38a1 is essential for neurogenesis and whether it has an impact on brain structure and function. Slc38a1 mRNA transcript and protein are widely expressed in the embryonic brain, including in the dorsal pallium and sub-pallium. At embryonic day 15.5, Slc38a1 localizes in neuronal stem cells in the ventricular zone in the forebrain, while it localizes in mature neurons in the sub-ventricular zone of the hindbrain. In the adult brain, Slc38a1 is not detected in neuronal stem cells in the sub-granular zone, however, it is highly enriched in mature local parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons and ependyma. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data further reveal that both the number of Slc38a1-expressing cells and the average transcript level of Slc38a1 are significantly higher in embryo brain cells compared to adults. In the embryo, Slc38a1 transcripts are particularly enriched in immature neuronal lineages and embryonic oligodendrocyte precursor populations, whereas in the adult, expression is more prominent in neural progenitor cells and radial glia. Disruption of Slc38a1 in mice impacts body weight, brain size and glutamatergic neuronal volume, while dendritic arborization is diminished and cellular life span is shortened. Altogether, Slc38a1 is essential for normal neurodevelopment, indirectly regulates adult neurogenesis in the sub-granular zone and influence neuronal morphology and cell viability.

">Mapping glioblastoma spreading: connexin43 and glial dynamic in mouse and human glioblastoma microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GBM), constitute the most prevalent primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). GBM cells demonstrate a notable ability to infiltrate the brain paren-chyma, precluding complete surgical resection. Here we investigated the spreading of GBM cells and the response of the CNS microenvironment fo-cusing on glial cells, which are essential interactors to GBM. We used acute and organotypic slices from the mouse brain and peritumoral cortex of patients with HGGs. We found that human peritumoral tissue from cortical resection was characterized by high levels of the astrocytic Connex-in43 protein (Cx43) and discrete infiltration of microglia. In contrast, the tu-mor core exhibited high myeloid infiltration and an altered extracellular ma-trix (ECM) composition, which was poor in CD44. We tracked mouse and primary human-labeled-GBM cells in 2D cultures and in co-culture with or-ganotypic slices generated from mouse brain and human peritumoral tissues. We found that the implanted GBM cells infiltrated the brain tissue, implying early glial modifications including an increase in Cx43 expression and distri-bution. Furthermore, the blockage of Cx43 hemichannels was accompanied by morphological changes and polarization of human GBM cells, typical for migration phenomena. The present study sheds light on the dynamics of GBM cells spreading in the living brain tissue, suggesting that the progression of the tumor correlates with changes within the host brain. Our findings identify the upregulation of Cx43 expression as a highly consistent modification in both mouse and human tissue that may be crucial for GBM infiltration.

">Crossfrequency routing in a hippocampocortical circuit during probabilistic reversal learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning under uncertainty requires detecting latent changes in environmental contingencies and flexibly adjusting choice strategy. To model this process and identify associated circuit dynamics, we trained rats on a two armed bandit task with uncued reward reversals while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the circuit comprised by dorsal hippocampus (CA1d), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral performance improved with training and progressively shifted from outcome-reactive exploration to an exploitation-biased strategy, quantified using a model-free index. Mixed-effects modeling combining behavioral and neural metrics identified tonic cortical synchrony in theta and fast gamma bands as a negative session scale performance marker. Theta and gamma oscillations were coordinated, as crossregional phase amplitude coupling showed that CA1d theta phase gated fast gamma activity in PFC, while biasing both slow and fast gamma bursts in LEC, which selectively increased at goal reaching. Neuronal spiking showed crossregional phase locking to both theta and gamma rhythms, indicating synchronized timing across the hippocampo-cortical circuit. Finally, distributed neuronal spiking across the circuit represented goal approach, yet only prefrontal neurons ramped during goal-reaching, suggesting a role in outcome assessment, while hippocampal and entorhinal units transiently suppressed, consistent with locomotor tracking and resetting. These results reveal a tonic cortical connectivity marker of ongoing performance during reversal learning and dissociate it from hippocampal theta mechanisms that selectively organize cortical gamma bursts and spike timing. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how frequency specific hippocampocortical interactions dynamically reconfigure to support strategy transitions, offering a circuit-level framework for understanding adaptive decision making under uncertainty.

">Multi-Timescale Neural Adaptation Failure as a Mechanistic Signature of Major Depression</a></h4>

              
                Major depression (MD) is usually characterized in terms of momentary abnormalities, such as negative bias or emotional blunting, derived from paradigms that measure only the first response to a stimulus. Yet depressive experience in daily life is repetitive and cumulative. Here we test the hypothesis that a failure of neural adaptation across repetitions is a core feature of MD. Using a repeated negative-stimulus paradigm, we quantified adaptation at micro (within-trial) and macro (across-session) scales via electroencephalography in 28 MD patients and 34 healthy controls, measuring both conventional event-related potentials and large-scale traveling-wave propagation. MD patients exhibited pervasive maladaptation: neural rigidity at the micro scale (absent repetition suppression) and progressive regulatory depletion at the macro scale (escalating emotional reactivity with declining cognitive control). Across analyses, adaptation-based metrics revealed larger group differences than single-shot indices, and classifiers built on adaptation features-especially traveling-wave dynamics-outperformed single-shot models (task AUC = 0.83 vs 0.78) and generalized to two independent datasets (up to AUC = 0.91). These findings challenge conventional symptom-based characterizations of MD, establishing adaptation failure-not initial reactivity-as the mechanistically primary pathological signature. This reframing provides a unified mechanistic explanation for rumination and cognitive inflexibility while offering a standardized, low-cost biomarker requiring minimal electrodes ([&le;]8 channels), enabling large-scale screening in resource-limited settings.

">Auditory and visual object processing in olfactory cortex of individuals with life-long olfactory deprivation</a></h4>

              
                The traditional view of modality-specific brain organization has been challenged by demonstrations of cross-modal processing, i.e. the activation of sensory cortex by atypical sensory input. An alternative theory suggests that rather than specializing simply in different sensory modalities, different parts of the cortex can specialize in different types of tasks. We recently addressed this question in the olfactory domain, showing that in normosmic individuals, the primary olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) responds to unimodal auditory and visual objects, regardless of how strongly they are associated with an odor. Here, we assess whether previous olfactory experience is a prerequisite for this cross-modal processing in the piriform cortex, using a unique group of individuals born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia; CA; n = 30). First, we were able to confirm the presence of clear visual and auditory activations in the piriform cortex of these sensory deprived individuals. As compared to normosmic controls (n = 30), these activations and associated functional connectivity, both within the piriform cortices and between piriform cortex and other regions, were altered in a modality dependent way. Our results show that life-long absence of olfactory input does not impede cross-modal activations by visual and auditory objects in the piriform cortex and are compatible with the idea of a task-based rather than modality-specific organization of this brain region.

">Task-Dependent Motor Unit Recruitment and Rate Coding Reveal Redistribution of Neural Drive in the Human Hand</a></h4>

              
                Although Henneman's size principle dictates an orderly small-to-large activation, evidence suggests a certain level of flexibility in the recruitment of spinal motor neurons depending on task demands. Here, we investigate motor unit (MU) recruitment flexibility in the human first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle while controlling for overall muscle activation across two functionally distinct tasks using high-density intramuscular EMG (HD-iEMG) electrode arrays. Six participants performed isometric index finger abduction where the FDI serves as the prime mover, and flexion with the FDI functioning as a synergist. Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and recruitment orders (ROs) were highly consistent within the same task, but differed significantly between abduction and flexion. Across participants, 45.3% of MUs showed changes in recruitment above the coefficient of repeatability across tasks compared to only 5.0% within tasks. Changes in RT were accompanied by corresponding adaptations in discharge rate (DR), preserving the inverse RT-DR relationship. MU size did not have an effect on recruitment variability. Intramuscular coherence analysis revealed no differences in the delta (1-5 Hz) or alpha (5-13 Hz) band, but beta band (13-30 Hz) coherence was significantly lower during flexion than abduction, indicating reduced high-frequency inputs when FDI serves as a synergist muscle. Together, these results indicate different distributions of net excitatory input to FDI MUs across different functional tasks, that may include stronger involvement of spinal circuits during flexion as opposed to abduction, as indicated by the reduced intramuscular beta coherence. Moreover, the present findings also demonstrate that common synaptic input and not intrinsic motor neuron properties determines the inverse relation between MU RT and DR.

">Pathway Anchored Multimodal Clustering Reveals Circuit Level Signatures in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease is increasingly understood as a disorder of distributed brain circuits, yet most imaging analyses do not explicitly respect pathway structure. We introduce a pathway anchored, multimodal clustering framework based on Scalable Robust Variational Compositional Co-clustering (SRVCC) that integrates structural MRI, free water corrected diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT in anatomically defined circuits. For each pathway, we derive a simple Multimodal Pathway Integrity Score (MPIS) that aggregates z normalised volume, microstructural, and dopaminergic measures into an interpretable summary of imaging integrity. In the PPMI cohort, SRVCC identifies stable imaging-derived patient clusters and feature modules under explicit model selection and bootstrap/stability checks, with covariate-adjusted analyses controlling for age, sex, education, medication, and scanner. MPIS shows coherent but modest structure function associations: lower nigrostriatal and frontostriatal integrity relates to higher motor burden (UPDRS-III), while reduced sensory/visuospatial and limbic integrity is linked to lower global cognition (MoCA); microvascular markers robustly stratify imaging profiles but display minimal cross-sectional coupling to these global scales. Feature-level reports highlight dominant region by modality contributors (e.g., striatal DAT-SBR, thalamic and cerebellar morphology, white-matter hyperintensity metrics), providing a transparent bridge from multimodal data to circuit-level signatures. This pathway-aware representation offers a principled, reproducible way to summarise multimodal imaging in PD and may support future work on circuit-informed stratification, prognosis, and targeted outcome measures.

">Cross-species etiologically informed stratification enables T cell receptor-based diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Developing peripheral blood-based diagnostic models for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), particularly those leveraging the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, has long been considered infeasible because patient-derived TCRs appear to lack convergent sequence motifs. We reasoned that this apparent absence of shared TCR features likely reflects both insufficient sample sizes and unaccounted immune heterogeneity within the iPD population. To overcome these barriers, we reconstructed TCR repertoires from the two largest iPD cohorts currently available and used three mechanistically distinct mouse models as etiologically informed anchors to molecularly stratify patients. Within these data-driven subtypes, we trained subtype-specific, multimodal multi-instance classifiers, achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.8 for both subtypes. Our findings underscore the critical role of disease stratification in enabling TCR repertoire-based modeling in neurodegenerative diseases.

">The Role of Temporal Factors in Processing Rapid Serial Visual Presentations</a></h4>

              
                Sequentially presented visual stimuli are often employed to investigate the temporal limits of our visual perception and attention. Due to the finite nature of the brains' processing capacity, experimental designs attempt to increase temporal separation within series to mitigate potential neural interference between stimuli. This is achieved through shortening of stimulus durations and lengthening of interstimulus intervals. Across two experiments, we parametrically varied these parameters for a serially presented checkerboard wedge stimulus and used inverted encoding modelling to assess the fidelity of the neural representation of spatial location. We found longer interstimulus intervals and shorter stimulus durations produced the most reliable decoding. Varying interstimulus interval altered the fidelity of neural representations via inter-item interference. By contrast, the influence of stimulus duration seemed largely analytic; in a fixed duration block, shorter stimulus duration enabled more presentations, which led to increased decoding accuracy. Distinct anticipatory and reactionary neural events were observed for stimuli presented in triplet sequences, which seemed consistent with forwards and backwards visual masking. The absence of an anticipatory event was observed when backward masking was stronger while a reactionary event was present for every stimulus subjected to forward masking.

">High-density lipoprotein mimetic peptide 4F ameliorates APOE4-associated lipid dysfunction in primary and iPSC-derived astrocytes and cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                APOE is the greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, APOE has three isoforms: APOE2 (E2), APOE3 (E3), and APOE4 (E4); E4 increases AD risk, while E3 is neutral and E2 decreases risk. In the brain, APOE is predominantly produced by astrocytes, where it binds lipids to form HDL-like particles, and plays a central role in lipid homeostasis, A{beta} clearance, and neuroimmune modulation. Its lipidation state is critical for function, with E4 being poorly lipidated compared to E2 and E3, contributing to the pathogenic effects of E4 while also offering a potential therapeutic target. We have previously demonstrated that the HDL-mimetic peptide 4F increases APOE secretion and lipidation in wild-type mouse astrocytes and counteracts the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42. Here, we assessed the ability of 4F to mitigate E4-associated dysfunction using primary astrocytes from humanized E3 and E4 knock-in mice and isogenic human iPSC-derived astrocytes and cerebral organoids. Results showed that 4F enhanced APOE secretion and lipidation in both cellular and organoid models in the absence or presence of aggregated A{beta}42. Compared to E3 astrocytes, E4 astrocytes were prone to A{beta}42-induced inhibition of APOE secretion and lipidation and increased accumulation of lipid droplets. 4F treatment ameliorated the inhibitory effects of A{beta}42 and reduced lipid droplet accumulation.

                <p>People with epilepsy may experience sudden death due to respiratory failure through mechanisms that are currently not well understood. Epilepsy causing mutations are thought to elicit seizures due to altered function of forebrain circuits, yet breathing is controlled largely by the brainstem. To investigate how altered forebrain activity could impact breathing, we examined respiratory and seizure phenotypes in a mouse epilepsy model with a forebrain-specific deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (<I>Pten</I>) gene. Using chronic diaphragm electromyography and cortical electroencephalography, we monitored <I>Pten</I> conditional knock-out (PTEN&ndash;cKO) mice (six males and four females) and control littermates (six males and three females) continuously from preseizure onset through end-stage disease. PTEN&ndash;cKO mice develop spontaneous seizures that progress in frequency with age, accompanied by gradual changes in respiratory function, even during interictal periods. As seizure burden increases, PTEN&ndash;cKO mice experience an increased frequency of interictal apneas, slowing of respiratory rhythm, prolongation of inspiratory bursts, and elevation of inspiratory effort. All animals experienced a terminal apnea prior to cardiac arrest. These findings demonstrate that <I>P</I><I>ten</I> deletion in the forebrain disrupts the control of breathing and leads to terminal respiratory failure.</p>

                <p>Neural signals necessary for gaze holding are produced in the excitatory networks of oculomotor neural integrators including the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). Our previous studies have shown that the activation of the networks can be evaluated by sustained excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses in vitro, in which a higher EPSC frequency after burst stimulation (100&nbsp;Hz, 20 trains) than the frequency before the stimulation lasts for &gt;1&nbsp;s. Both the PHN and the INC receive serotonergic inputs mainly from the dorsal raphe nucleus, and serotonin (5-HT) induces depolarizing responses via 5-HT<SUB>2</SUB> or 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptors and hyperpolarizing responses via 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors in PHN and INC neurons. However, how 5-HT affects sustained EPSC responses remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of 5-HT on sustained EPSC responses using whole-cell recordings in brainstem slices obtained from rats of either sex. Compared with the control treatment, bath application of 10&nbsp;&mu;M 5-HT significantly reduced the duration and frequency of the EPSC responses in the PHN and the INC. The application of 8-OH-DPAT, an agonist of the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor, suppressed sustained EPSC responses, but agonists of the 5-HT<SUB>2</SUB> and 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptors had no effect on the responses, indicating that 5-HT has a suppressive effect on sustained EPSC responses via 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors. These results suggest that neurons that express 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors participate in excitatory networks and that the suppressive effect of 5-HT can facilitate exploratory behavior through eye movements rather than gaze holding.</p>

                Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., shelter, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.

In an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aim to identify animal viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans. These studies have revealed substantial diversity in identified viruses. However, the number of tools currently available to assess pandemic risk is limited. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using <i>in vitro</i> laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outcomes that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we use within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals to estimate parameters relevant to transmission between pairs of individuals. We then extend this model to estimate epidemiological parameters, such as reproduction numbers and generation intervals. We present our analytical framework in the context of two influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (Cal/2009) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (Hong Kong/1968). In a head-to-head comparison, we find that Cal/2009 has higher pandemic potential than Hong Kong/1968. Our results depend on several assumptions, including that within-host viral dynamics in humans and those in the model animal used (here, ferrets) share quantitative similarities and that viral transmissibility between model animals reflects viral transmissibility between humans. The methods we present to assess pandemic risk of viral isolates can be used to improve relative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern.

                <p>by Christopher H. Bohrer, Daniel R. Larson</p>

Numerous functions hinge on the spatial arrangement of different genomic loci. Hence, microscopy techniques, such as chromatin tracing, have been developed to localize multiple loci in fixed cells. Depending on the throughput and specifics of the experiment, localization errors can still obscure the true spatial locations. We have developed a post-processing methodology to address this challenge without the need for additional experimentation: Loci Enabled Advanced Resolution (LEAR). By leveraging the fact that localization errors increase the variability of the displacements between loci, and given an approximation of the localization error, we can approximate the ground truth spatial variation for each pair of loci to guide an iterative error correction process. After validating our approach with simulation and experiment, we then applied our approach to existing chromatin tracing data that probed the relation between chromatin organization and <i>Sox2</i> regulation, where previous work found no clear correlation between enhancer-promoter proximity and transcription bursts in individual cells. We discovered a correlation previously obscured by localization error, clearly demonstrating the need for the methodology. We then investigated the influence of loop-extrusion on higher order multi-way contact frequencies, which dramatically increased with the application of the LEAR method, finding that certain multi-way contacts were only present with loop-extrusion.

                Background The integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education has become increasingly relevant to equip students with the ability to reason, argue, and solve complex real-world problems. Despite its recognized importance, this integration remains fragmented across curricula and inconsistently applied in classroom practice. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze empirical evidence published between 2019 and 2025. Searches were performed in Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Dialnet databases. Inclusion criteria focused on open-access, peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish addressing the integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education. From 1,457 records initially retrieved, 24 empirical studies were selected for full analysis. Results The studies reviewed indicate that mathematical competencies, defined as the ability to model, interpret, and solve problems through logical reasoning, are reinforced when integrated with critical thinking skills such as evaluation, argumentation, and evidence-based decision-making. Active methodologies, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Based Learning (PjBL), STEM, and gamification, were identified as the most effective strategies to foster this integration. However, their implementation is often constrained by structural barriers such as limited teacher training, rigid curricula, and insufficient technological infrastructure. Conclusion Integrative, student-centered approaches supported by active learning methodologies enhance higher-order cognitive development and prepare learners to meet the demands of 21st-century education. Future research should address methodological standardization, teacher preparation, and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainable and equitable implementation of these strategies.

                In this issue of Neuron, Gleichman et al. reveal that astrocytes exhibit region-specific features after stroke. Cortical astrocytes, but not white matter astrocytes, leverage Lamc1 to promote vascular remodeling, highlighting the complexity of harnessing astrocytes for neurorepair.

                Winner effects, where past victories enhance success, shape competition. In this issue of Neuron, Zheng et al. show that female mice form hierarchies with weaker winner effects because prefrontal interneurons limit thalamic-prefrontal synaptic strengthening, revealing a framework for sex differences in social dominance.

                Ripples support memory consolidation via neuronal replay. Castelli et al. identify two ripple types with distinct inputs and dynamics. This Preview discusses their findings in the context of current views on ripple diversity and hypothesizes that such diversity reflects a replay grammar.

                In this issue of Neuron, Choi et al. demonstrate that stroke disrupts cortical state transitions underlying reach-to-grasp control. Recovery depends on restoring separability between beta bursts and execution-related co-firing, a process enhanced by low-frequency stimulation that promotes motor recovery.

                Over the past decade, the PsychENCODE Consortium has transformed psychiatric genomics—from static maps of genetic risk to dynamic, cell-resolved models of the human brain—linking DNA sequence to neural circuitry and behavior and laying the foundation for precision approaches to mental illness.

                Variable spiking is a ubiquitous neuronal feature. Pattadkal et al. show that physiological spiking variability is reflective of input drive characteristics. They demonstrate that weak input synchrony induces physiological variability and identify synchrony timescales to be critical in regulating variability shifts, using in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches.

                Oelschlegel et al. report that the schizophrenia-risk gene calneuron-1 is elevated in schizophrenia, elicits schizophrenia-like behavior, and impairs network communication in mice. Calneuron-1 is an accessory subunit of muscarinic M1R that inhibits G-protein coupling and shuts off M1R signaling in schizophrenia. The M1R agonist xanomeline interrupts calneuron-1/M1R interaction and rescues schizophrenia-related deficits.
