                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. Fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01966">Alignment between Brains and AI: Evidence for Convergent Evolution across Modalities, Scales and Training Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms -- a form of convergent evolution. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal representations of over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains, from 1.33M to 72B parameters. Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain alignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing markedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p<7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53, p<2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment consistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that developing brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward higher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit strongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models show progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers converge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment systematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions. These findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task performance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational strategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent information processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01967">Ghost in the Machine: Examining the Philosophical Implications of Recursive Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether contemporary AI architectures employing deep recursion, meta-learning, and self-referential mechanisms provide evidence of machine consciousness. Integrating philosophical history, cognitive science, and AI engineering, it situates recursive algorithms within a lineage spanning Cartesian dualism, Husserlian intentionality, Integrated Information Theory, the Global Workspace model, and enactivist perspectives. The argument proceeds through textual analysis, comparative architecture review, and synthesis of neuroscience findings on integration and prediction. Methodologically, the study combines conceptual analysis, case studies, and normative risk assessment informed by phenomenology and embodied cognition. Technical examples, including transformer self-attention, meta-cognitive agents, and neuromorphic chips, illustrate how functional self-modeling can arise without subjective experience. By distinguishing functional from phenomenal consciousness, the paper argues that symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain unresolved barriers to attributing sentience to current AI. Ethical analysis explores risks of premature anthropomorphism versus neglect of future sentient systems; legal implications include personhood, liability, authorship, and labor impacts. Future directions include quantum architectures, embodied robotics, unsupervised world modeling, and empirical tests for non-biological phenomenality. The study reframes the "hard problem" as a graded and increasingly testable phenomenon, rather than a metaphysical impasse. It concludes that recursive self-referential design enhances capability but does not entail consciousness or justify moral status. Keywords: Recursive algorithms; self-reference; machine consciousness; AI ethics; AI consciousness

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02064">REMI: Reconstructing Episodic Memory During Intrinsic Path Planning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position. In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals maintain grid and place representations together to support planning. Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02264">NLP4Neuro: Sequence-to-sequence learning for neural population decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience. NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide neural circuit dissection.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02304">Nonlinear Network Reconstruction by Pairwise Time-delayed Transfer Entropy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing network structural connectivity is crucial for understanding dynamics and functions of complex networks across disciplines. In many networks, structural connectivity is not observable, which requires to be inferred via causal inference methods. Among them, transfer entropy (TE) is one of the most broadly applied causality measure due to its model-free property. However, TE often faces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional probability estimation, and the relation between the inferred causal connectivity and the underlying structural connectivity remains poorly understood. Here we address these issues by proposing a pairwise time-delayed transfer entropy (PTD-TE) method. We theoretically establish a quadratic relationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths, and demonstrate its immunity to dimensionality issues and broad applicability. Tests on biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and electrophysiological data show PTD-TE achieves consistent, high-performance reconstructions. Compared to a bunch of existing approaches for network connectivity reconstruction, PTD-TE outperforms these methods across various network systems in accuracy and robustness against noise. Our framework provides a scalable, model-agnostic tool for structural connectivity inference in nonlinear real-world networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02450">Network structural change point detection and reconstruction for balanced neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics and functions critically depends on knowledge of the network connectivity among neurons. However, the complexity of brain structural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by synaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly challenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal recordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and requires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them unsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes. To fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural changes, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed correlation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in balanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes in structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time series. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network using spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show the effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale network simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method accommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic coupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled subnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in real experimental situations. Our CPD-TDCC framework addresses the critical gap in network reconstruction by accounting connectivity-induced changes points, potentially offering a valuable tool for studying structure and dynamics in the cortical brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02614">A Dopamine-Serotonin Theory of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness grounded in mathematical formalism and supported by clinical data analysis. The framework developed herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous, non-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with dopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as the complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the full spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the ultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena such as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary persistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration of classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious medical events (< 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess proves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from 242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for system integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The analysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p<.0001), confirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103">What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Abstract: Conscious experience permeates our daily lives, yet general consensus on a theory of consciousness remains elusive. In the face of such difficulty, an alternative strategy is to address a more general (meta-level) version of the problem for insights into the original problem at hand. Category theory was developed for this purpose, i.e. as an axiomatic (meta-)mathematical theory for comparison of mathematical structures, and so affords a (formally) formal approach towards a theory of consciousness. In this way, category theory is used for comparison with Information Integration Theory (IIT) as a supposed axiomatic theory of consciousness, which says that every conscious state involves six axiomatic properties: the IIT axioms for consciousness. All six axioms are shown to follow from the categorical notion of a universal mapping property: a unique-existence condition for all instances in the domain of interest. Accordingly, this categorical approach affords a formal basis for further development of a (meta-)mathematical theory of consciousness, whence the slogan, ``Consciousness is a universal property.''

                arXiv:2507.01433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, making its early detection essential. This study investigates the neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in MCI patients using EEG and behavioral data during an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task. A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks with congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels. During these tasks, EEG data were analyzed for alpha band coherence's functional connectivity, focusing on Global Efficiency (GE), while Reaction Time (RT) and Hit Rate (HR) were also collected.
  Our findings reveal significant interactions between congruency, saliency, and cognitive status on GE, RT, and HR. In HCs, congruent conditions resulted in higher GE (p = 0.0114, multivariate t-distribution correction, MVT), faster RTs (p < 0.0001, MVT), and higher HRs (p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions. HCs also showed increased GE in salient conditions for incongruent trials (p = 0.0406, MVT). MCIs exhibited benefits from congruent conditions with shorter RTs and higher HRs (both p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions but showed reduced adaptability in GE, with no significant GE differences between conditions.
  These results highlight the potential of alpha band coherence and GE as early markers for cognitive impairment. By integrating GE, RT, and HR, this study provides insights into the interplay between neural efficiency, processing speed, and task accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into cognitive load management and interference effects, indicating benefits for interventions aimed at improving attentional control and processing speed in MCIs.

                arXiv:2504.16342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.

Abstract: Neuronal circuits of the cerebral cortex are the structural basis of mammalian cognition. The same qualitative components and connectivity motifs are repeated across functionally specialized cortical areas and mammalian species, suggesting a single underlying algorithmic motif. Here, we propose a perspective on current knowledge of the cortical structure, from which we extract two core principles for computational modeling. The first principle is that cortical cell types fulfill distinct computational roles. The second principle is that cortical connectivity can be efficiently characterized by only a few canonical blueprints of connectivity between cell types. Starting with these two foundational principles, we outline a general framework for building functional and mechanistic models of cortical circuits.

                arXiv:2507.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions. Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges. This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization challenges.

                arXiv:2507.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional. These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations, offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally, we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms, revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

                arXiv:2507.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D, AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

                arXiv:2507.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights, a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of ($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

                arXiv:2507.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08290">Reconsidering the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise higher energy efficiency over conventional Quantized Artificial Neural Networks (QNNs) due to their event-driven, spike-based computation. However, prevailing energy evaluations often oversimplify, focusing on computational aspects while neglecting critical overheads like comprehensive data movement and memory access. Such simplifications can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the true energy benefits of SNNs. This paper presents a rigorous re-evaluation. We establish a fair baseline by mapping rate-encoded SNNs with $T$ timesteps to functionally equivalent QNNs with $\lceil \log_2(T+1) \rceil$ bits. This ensures both models have comparable representational capacities, as well has similar hardware requirement, enabling meaningful energy comparisons. We introduce a detailed analytical energy model encompassing core computation and data movement (sparse and dense activations, weights). Using this model, we systematically explore a wide parameter space, including intrinsic network characteristics ($T$, spike rate $s_r$, QNN sparsity $\gamma$, model size $N$, weight bit-level) and hardware characteristics (memory system and network-on-chip). Our analysis identifies specific operational regimes where SNNs genuinely offer superior energy efficiency. For example, under typical neuromorphic hardware conditions, SNNs with moderate time windows ($T \in [5,10]$) require an average spike rate ($s_r$) below 6.4% to outperform equivalent QNNs. These insights guide the design of genuinely energy-efficient neural network solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168">Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for Comprehensive GPU Acceleration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.17168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP still remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for comprehensive GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Comprehensive experiments show that EvoGP achieves up to 140x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementations, while maintaining competitive accuracy and significantly improving scalability under large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840">Beyond Scale: The Diversity Coefficient as a Data Quality Metric for Variability in Natural Language Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2306.13840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current trends in pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on the scaling of model and dataset size. While the quality of pre-training data is considered an important factor for training powerful LLMs, it remains a nebulous concept that has not been rigorously characterized. To this end, we propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes (51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads to improved evaluation performance.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Individuals with cerebral visual impairment (CVI) often demonstrate difficulties with visual selective attention; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether structural and functional connectivity between and within the attention networks, thalamus, and early visual areas is differentially associated with performance on a conjunction search task in participants with CVI as compared to controls. Data from 26 participants was collected and analyzed (10 CVI, four female, 17.4 years, 5.38 s.d., 16 control, 10 female, 22.25 years, 4.25 s.d.). White matter tracts associated with the dorsal and ventral attention networks as well as structural and functional connectivity matrices of the dorsal and ventral attention networks were generated for each participant. Group differences in conjunction search outcomes, tract volume, and network connectivity strength were evaluated. General linear models were used to investigate the relationship between neuroimaging predictor variables and each of the four conjunction search primary outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for age and verbal cognition. In the CVI group impaired visual search was associated with weaker structural and stronger functional connectivity, while in the control group the opposite effect was observed. Together, these results suggest that functional over-recruitment may be a maladaptive compensatory mechanism.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Agreement and disagreement are essential brain processes that enable effective communication and decision-making. However, a clear neurophysiological framework explaining their organization is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify EEG correlates of implicit agreement and disagreement, developing a novel experimental paradigm to model these internal responses. Participants were tasked with mentally responding to binary (“yes” or “no”) questions and evaluating the accuracy of a computer system’s attempts to “guess” their responses. Event-related potentials (ERP) revealed distinct patterns associated with agreement and disagreement in two key contexts: when participants read the final word of a question and when they observed the computer’s “guess.” Disagreement, compared to agreement, elicited larger ERP amplitudes, specifically an enhanced N400 component in the first context and increased feedback-related negativity in the second. Considering the associations of these ERP components with cognitive processes, this research offers robust evidence linking agreement and disagreement to the brain’s effort in reconciling personal beliefs and expectations with new information. Furthermore, the experimental framework and findings provide a foundation for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) capable of detecting “yes” and “no” commands based on their intrinsic EEG predictors, offering promising applications in assistive technologies and neural communication systems.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to proficiently play a musical instrument requires a fine-grained synchronization between several sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes functional changes with musical training, identifiable also in resting-state data. These studies analyzed functional MRI or electrophysiological frequency-specific brain networks in isolation. While the analysis of such “mono-layer” networks has proven useful, it fails to capture the complexities of multiple interacting networks. To this end, we applied a multilayer network framework for analyzing publicly available data (Open MEG Archive) obtained with magnetoencephalography. We investigated resting-state differences between participants with musical training (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31) and those without (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31). While single-layer analysis did not demonstrate any group differences, multilayer analysis revealed that musicians show a modular organization that spans visuo-motor and fronto-temporal areas, known to be involved in musical performance execution, which is significantly different from non-musicians. Differences between the two groups are primarily observed in the theta (6.5 to 8 Hz), alpha1 (8.5 to 10 Hz), and beta1 (12.5 to 16 Hz) frequency bands. We demonstrate that the multilayer method provides additional information that single-layer analysis cannot. Overall, the multilayer network method provides a unique opportunity to explore the pan-spectral nature of oscillatory networks, with studies of brain plasticity as a potential future application.</span>

                <p>We have documented the early embryonic development of hypothalamic neurons expressing &beta;-endorphin, &alpha;-melanocyte&ndash;stimulating hormone, neuropeptide Y, and kisspeptin in rhesus macaques, an animal model that is very similar to humans. Neurons expressing both &beta;-End and &alpha;MSH are the first to develop and are initially located in the lateral basal hypothalamus (LBH) as early as day 32&ndash;34 of gestation. By day 45 of gestation, these neurons have migrated into the medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) area as their final destination. NPY neurons within the ARH develop later and first appear at day 44 of fetal life, at which time a cluster of neurons is present within the ARH&ndash;MBH area. NPY neurons continue to be expressed within the ARH area at all of the later fetal ages analyzed. Similarly, kisspeptin neurons develop later compared with &beta;-End, although only a few cells are present in the ARH by day 44 of gestation, at which time kisspeptin is also expressed in the developing anterior lobe of the pituitary. By day 70 of gestation, the rostral to caudal distribution and cell size of Kiss1 neurons within the MBH are similar in females and males. In addition, Kiss1 fibers are also expressed in the POA by day 70. By day 130 of gestation, Kiss1 neurons exhibit a wider dorsal and lateral distribution within the MBH, with highly increased fiber distribution. Therefore, the development of these neurons is much earlier than what had been described previously for &alpha;MSH and NPY in primates.</p>

                Background Early and accurate prediction of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is essential for reducing mortality and enabling timely intervention. Misdiagnosis can lead to severe health outcomes, emphasizing the need for robust and intelligent predictive models. Deep learning approaches have shown strong potential in identifying hidden patterns in medical data and aiding clinical decision-making. Methods This study proposes a novel Hybrid Residual Attention with Echo State Network (HRAESN) model that integrates Attention Residual Learning (ARL) with Echo State Networks (ESN) to enhance feature extraction and temporal data learning. The hybrid model is designed to refine feature attention through residual learning while leveraging ESN for efficient time-series prediction. Two publicly available benchmark datasets were used for evaluation: the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset comprising 70,000 instances and the UCI Heart Disease dataset containing 303 instances. Missing values in both datasets were handled using a multiple imputation technique tailored for ischemic heart disease. Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure. Results The proposed HRAESN model demonstrated superior classification performance compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on the Kaggle dataset and 97.7% on the UCI dataset. Additionally, the model showed high sensitivity and specificity, indicating strong diagnostic capability and reliability in identifying both diseased and non-diseased cases. Conclusions The HRAESN model effectively combines the strengths of residual attention mechanisms and echo state networks, resulting in improved accuracy and stability for ischemic heart disease prediction. Its strong performance on benchmark datasets confirms its potential as a valuable clinical decision support tool for early detection of IHD. Future work may focus on optimizing model complexity and integrating real-time medical IoT data to enhance practical deployment in healthcare systems.

                Background Complications during the puerperium present abnormal conditions that can jeopardize the health and well-being of both mother and newborn. These complications are significant contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the factors associated with postpartum disease complications. Methods This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251013692). A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases, including Scopus and PubMed, to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. Eligible studies included full-text, peer-reviewed articles that used quantitative or qualitative designs and addressed postpartum complications in accordance with the PEO framework. Descriptive analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results A total of 907 records were identified, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings highlight a range of factors significantly associated with postpartum complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, maternal age >35 years, depressive and anxiety disorders, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, type of vaginal delivery, infant-related health concerns, childhood trauma, low social support, low educational attainment of both mothers and husbands, perceived social isolation, and marital dissatisfaction. While early detection and intervention were not directly evaluated in these studies, the identification of these risk factors suggests that targeted screening and supportive strategies may be beneficial in mitigating postpartum complications. Conclusions This review identifies multiple psychosocial, demographic, and clinical factors associated with postpartum complications. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and comprehensive postpartum care to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-648/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Heart-shape sign in bilateral medial medullary infarction: a case report and review of the litterature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Introduction Bilateral medial medullary infarction (BMMI) is a rare ischemic lesion that typically presents as dysarthria, dysphagia, tetraplegia, and respiratory failure. It is known for its characteristic « heart-shaped » appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The etiological profile of this disease has not been studied previously. Considering the unfavorable outcome of BMMI, it is crucial to investigate the clinical and etiological profile to optimize the management of these patients. Case presentation A 49-year-old north-african smoker male patient was admitted to the neurology department of the military hospital of Tunis-Tunisia 24 hours after acute-onset slurred speech, weakness and impaired sensation in all four limbs, predominantly in the lower limb. His family history was remarkable for young-onset brainstem ischemic stroke (IS) in a brother. Neurological examination a right hemiparesis with tactile hemihypoesthesia and right astereognosia (modified Rankin scale of 2). Cerebral MRI showed radiological aspect compatible with diagnosis of « heart-shaped » BMMI. A heterozygous mutation R506 of Leiden Factor V was identified. The patient’s condition remained stable at 15 months follow-up (Modified Rankins Scale at 2) and no recurrence of IS was noted under anticoagulation to date. Conclusions BMMI is a rare case of medial medullary infarction, accounting for less than 1% of IS cases. To our knowledge, this is the first case of « heart-shaped » BMMI linked to Leiden Factor V mutation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-647/v1?src=rss">The influence of self-esteem and emotional intelligence on addiction to social networks in Peruvian university students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background The digital age has brought numerous technological advances that have transformed our way of living and relating. Among them, Social media have revolutionized how we communicate and share information. However, there is a silent danger behind this seemingly harmless tool: Social media addiction. For this reason, the objective of this re-search was to determine if emotional intelligence and self-esteem predict addiction to Social media in Peruvian university students. Methods Therefore, a cross-sectional predictive design study was developed, in which 289 Peruvian university students participated voluntarily, whose ages fluctuated between 23.61 years with a standard deviation of 5.88 years, of which 54.06% were female and 45.94% were male. In addition, to measure the variables, the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale – EAR, and the Social media addiction questionnaire (ARS) were used. Results Linear regression results show that self-esteem (SELF) is the strongest predictor across all models, with beta coefficients of -0.293 for Social Media Obsession (SMO), -0.225 for Lack of Control, and -0.153 (LAU) for Excessive Social Media Use (USO). Regarding the emotional intelligence dimensions, it is observed that Appraisal of Own Emo-tions (SEA) and Use of Own Emotions (UEO) have weak negative effects on SMO addiction, with beta coefficients ranging from -0.072 to -0.136. Conclusions It is concluded that the models explain 17.2% of the variance in SMO, 14.8% in LAU, and 9.2% in USO. These values suggest that, while self-esteem and emotional intelligence influence SMO addiction, other additional factors may also play an important role.

                <p>by Boyu Jiang, Nick Quinn-Bohmann, Christian Diener, Vignesh Bose Nathan, Yu Han-Hallett, Lavanya Reddivari, Sean M. Gibbons, Priyanka Baloni</p>

The colonic epithelium plays a key role in the host-microbiome interactions, allowing uptake of various nutrients and driving important metabolic processes. To unravel detailed metabolic activities in the human colonic epithelium, our present study focuses on the generation of the first cell-type specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of human colonic epithelial cells, named iColonEpithelium. GEMs are powerful tools for exploring reactions and metabolites at the systems level and predicting the flux distributions at steady state. Our cell-type-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic reconstruction captures genes specifically expressed in the human colonic epithelial cells. iColonEpithelium is also capable of performing metabolic tasks specific to the colonic epithelium. A unique transport reaction compartment has been included to allow for the simulation of metabolic interactions with the gut microbiome. We used iColonEpithelium to identify metabolic signatures associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We used single-cell RNA sequencing data from Crohn’s Diseases (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples to build disease-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic networks in order to predict metabolic signatures of colonocytes in both healthy and disease states. We identified reactions in nucleotide interconversion, fatty acid synthesis and tryptophan metabolism were differentially regulated in CD and UC conditions, relative to healthy control, which were in accordance with experimental results. The iColonEpithelium metabolic network can be used to identify mechanisms at the cellular level, and we show an initial proof-of-concept for how our tool can be leveraged to explore the metabolic interactions between host and gut microbiota.

                <p>by Shayna A. Sura, James O. Lloyd-Smith, Peggy Fong</p>

Ecological communities globally are shifting to degraded states, motivating research into attributes supporting resilience or leading to alternative stable states. Coral reef communities are particularly vulnerable as they are facing myriad anthropogenic impacts that contribute to shifts away from coral dominance, motivating much research on whether these shifts are gradual and reversible transitions versus alternative stable states. Empirical studies demonstrate functionally-diverse herbivorous fish communities support coral reef resilience to anthropogenic impacts. However, few coral reef models incorporate herbivore and algal functional groups and quantify their effects on reef resilience and alternative stable states. We built a coral reef model that includes herbivorous fish functional groups and their algal targets and explored how this expansion affects predictions of resilience and alternative stable states under different scenarios of human impacts. We found evenness across the functional groups of herbivores is increasingly important for reef recovery as fishing pressure increases, and recovery is promoted when algal communities begin with more turf than macroalgae. Our findings also highlight that models omitting functional groups that comprise real communities will miss crucial phenomena, such as loss of alternative stable states for browser-dominated communities, or continued presence of alternative stable states in grazer-dominated communities even when fishing pressure is removed entirely. This work advances our ability to understand and predict coral reef resilience and alternative stable states in the Anthropocene, and provides guidance for conservation policy on fishing practices.

Nucleotide recoding RNA sequencing methods (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) are powerful approaches for assaying transcript population dynamics. In addition, these methods have been extended to probe a host of regulated steps in the RNA life cycle. Current bioinformatic tools significantly constrain analyses of NR-seq data. To address this limitation, we developed EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/EZbakR), an R package to facilitate a more comprehensive set of NR-seq analyses, and fastq2EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/fastq2EZbakR), a Snakemake pipeline for flexible preprocessing of NR-seq datasets, collectively referred to as the EZbakR suite. Together, these tools generalize many aspects of the NR-seq analysis workflow. The fastq2EZbakR pipeline can assign reads to a diverse set of genomic features (e.g., genes, exons, splice junctions), and EZbakR can perform analyses on any combination of these features. EZbakR extends standard NR-seq mutational modeling to support multi-label analyses (e.g., s<sup>4</sup>U and s<sup>6</sup>G dual labeling), and implements an improved hierarchical model to better account for transcript-to-transcript variance in metabolic label incorporation. EZbakR also generalizes dynamical systems modeling of NR-seq data to support analyses of premature mRNA processing and flow between subcellular compartments. Finally, EZbakR implements flexible and well-powered comparative analyses of all estimated parameters via design matrix-specified generalized linear modeling. The EZbakR suite will thus allow researchers to make full, effective use of NR-seq data.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) significantly affects morbidity and mortality rates. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) play a crucial role in managing AF but often exhibit gender-specific complications. Our study aims to identify gender-specific Class III AADs by integrating in vitro measurements, in silico models, and machine learning (ML). By simulating drug effects on a diverse cardiomyocyte model population (5,663 males and 6,184 females), we classified drugs based on changes in action potentials and calcium transients. Using sex-dependent Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, we achieved high prediction accuracy (>89%) and F1 score (>87%). Key features included changes in resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude, duration and area. Gender differences in drug responses were attributed to lower IK1, INa, and Ito in females.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012156">Cooperative coding of continuous variables in networks with sparsity constraint</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Züge, Natalie Schieferstein, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer</p>

A hallmark of biological and artificial neural networks is that neurons tile the range of continuous sensory inputs and intrinsic variables with overlapping responses. It is characteristic for the underlying recurrent connectivity in the cortex that neurons with similar tuning predominantly excite each other. The reason for such an architecture is not clear. Using an analytically tractable model as well as spiking neural networks, we show that it can naturally arise from a cooperative coding scheme. In this scheme neurons with similar responses specifically support each other by sharing their computations to obtain the desired population code. This sharing allows each neuron to effectively respond to a broad variety of inputs, while only receiving few feedforward and recurrent connections. Few strong, specific recurrent connections then replace many feedforward and less specific recurrent connections, such that the resulting connectivity optimizes the number of required synapses. This suggests that the number of required synapses may be a crucial constraining factor in biological neural networks. Synaptic savings increase with the dimensionality of the encoded variables. We find a trade-off between saving synapses and response speed. The response speed improves by orders of magnitude when utilizing the window of opportunity between excitatory and delayed inhibitory currents that arises if, as found in experiments, spike frequency adaptation is present or strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong, shortly-lagged inhibition.

                <p>by Alex S. Nicholson, David A. Priestman, Robin Antrobus, James C. Williamson, Reuben Bush, Shannon J. McKie, Henry G. Barrow, Emily Smith, Kostantin Dobrenis, Nicholas A. Bright, Frances M. Platt, Janet E. Deane</p>

Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are important bioactive membrane components. GSLs containing sialic acids, known as gangliosides, are highly abundant in the brain and diseases of ganglioside metabolism cause severe early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is processed by β-hexosaminidase A and when non-functional GM2 accumulates causing Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed i3Neuron-based disease models demonstrating storage of GM2 and severe endolysosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the plasma membrane (PM) is significantly altered in its lipid and protein composition. These changes are driven in part by lysosomal exocytosis causing inappropriate accumulation of lysosomal proteins on the cell surface. There are also significant changes in synaptic protein abundances with direct functional impact on neuronal activity. Lysosomal proteins are also enriched at the PM in GM1 gangliosidosis supporting that lysosomal exocytosis is a conserved mechanism of PM proteome change in these diseases. This work provides mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunction in gangliosidoses highlighting that these are severe PM disorders with implications for other lysosomal and neurodegenerative diseases.

                <p>by Hyunwoo Kim, Joon-Goon Kim, Jueun Sim, Hoyeon Nam, In Cho, Hyejin Shin, Junyoung Kwon, Dae-Hyeon Song, Seoungbin Bae, Young-Gyu Yoon, Taeyun Ku, Jae-Byum Chang</p>

Multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels has been extensively studied to visualize numerous biomolecules at a nanoscale resolution in situ. Previous studies have employed sparse labels, such as DAPI or lectin staining, as registration markers. However, these sparse labels do not adequately capture the full extent of deformation across the entire region of interest. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of dense labels, specifically fluorophore <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester staining, as registration markers to achieve highly accurate image registration. We first tested several NHS-functionalized fluorophores as fiducial markers and identified the proper candidates for three-dimensional (3D) multiplexed cyclic imaging. We analyzed the registration accuracy between DAPI and NHS-ester staining and illustrated that dense label-based registration provides a more accurate registration performance. In the multiplexed imaging of expanded specimens, we observed that repetitive expansion/shrinking processes and chemical treatments for signal elimination can induce 3D nonlinear distortion. This sample distortion can be mitigated by re-embedding the tissue gel or replacing the chemical de-staining process with photobleaching-based signal removal or computational signal unmixing. With such an optimized experimental setup, we demonstrated 3D multiplexed cyclic imaging with nanoscale precision image registration. Finally, we prove that dense biological structures, such as actin, can be used as registration markers to achieve high registration accuracy. We anticipate that the proposed dense labeling strategy will overcome the technical limitations of multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels, offering high-precision registration. We expect it to be widely adopted by the biological and medical communities.

                <p>by Sumedha Ravishankar, Samantha M. Tuohey, Nicole O. Ramos, Satoshi Uchiyama, Megan I. Hayes, Kalisa Kang, Victor Nizet, Cressida A. Madigan</p>

To cause meningitis, bacteria move from the bloodstream to the brain, crossing the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier. Most studies on how bacteria cross the blood–brain barrier have been performed in vitro using cultured endothelial cells, due to a paucity of animal models. Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and is primarily thought to cross the blood–brain barrier by transcytosis through endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis <i>in vivo</i>, we used optically transparent zebrafish larvae. Time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed that GBS forms extracellular microcolonies in brain blood vessels and causes perforation and lysis of blood–brain barrier endothelial cells, which promotes bacterial entry into the brain. Vessels infected with GBS microcolonies were distorted and contained thrombi. Inhibition of clotting worsened brain invasion, suggesting a host-protective role for thrombi. The GBS lysin cylE, implicated in brain invasion <i>in vitro</i>, was found dispensable <i>in vivo</i>. Instead, pro-inflammatory mediators associated with endothelial cell damage and blood–brain barrier breakdown were specifically upregulated in the zebrafish head upon GBS entry into the brain. Therefore, GBS crosses the blood–brain barrier <i>in vivo</i> not by transcytosis, but by endothelial cell lysis and death. Given that we observe the same invasion route for a meningitis-associated strain of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, our findings suggest that streptococcal infection of brain blood vessels triggers endothelial cell inflammation and lysis, thereby facilitating brain invasion.

<p>The influence of P2X7R activation on the biological behavior of glioma and its potential value as a therapeutic target for glioma.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, characterized by high invasiveness and poor prognosis. The purinergic ligand-gated ion channel 7 receptor (P2X7R), an ion channel-type purinergic receptor with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as its ligand, is widely expressed in various tumor cells, including glioma. Moreover, it plays crucial biological functions in the progression of glioma. P2X7R promotes the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of glioma by activating multiple signaling pathways, facilitating epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioma. However, the activation of P2X7R by high concentrations of ATP can induce cell necrosis or pyroptosis, exerting an anti-glioma effect. The bidirectional nature of its functions may be related to differences in the subtypes of P2X7R, cell types, as well as the TME. P2X7R antagonists can inhibit its effect in glioma, while the expression of P2X7R can enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this review, the structure and function of P2X7R, its role in tumor, especially its mechanism of action in glioma, and its latent capacity value as a target for therapeutic of glioma were reviewed in detail.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-646/v1?src=rss">Comparison of effects of 0.5 % levobupivacaine with buprenorphine and nalbuphine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block- A Randomised Control Trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The brachial plexus block is one of the most commonly used anaesthesia techniques for upper limb surgeries. The supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBB) has been a frequently performed technique because it provides excellent quality of blockade, faster onset, and dense blockade. Different adjuvants and local anaesthetics are used to improve the onset and quality of the blockade. In our study, the local anaesthetic used was 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the adjuvants used were buprenorphine and nalbuphine. Materials and Methods Our study, a randomised, prospective double-blinded investigation, was conducted on 60 patients scheduled for elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries. We performed the Supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 25 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine plain (Group L) or with buprenorphine (Group LB) or with nalbuphine (Group LN) as adjuvants. We recorded the onset, duration of blockade (motor and sensory), sedation score, and time for rescue analgesia. Results The onset of sensorimotor blockade was notably faster in Group LB than in Group LN or Group L. The sensorimotor blockade duration was significantly prolonged in Group LB compared to LN and L. Group LB also had a delayed time after 12 hrs for rescue analgesia compared to the other two groups. Conclusion Buprenorphine as an adjuvant to 0.5% levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly shortens the onset of sensorimotor blockade and enhances the duration of blockade when compared to nalbuphine. Both the adjuvants delayed the time for request of rescue analgesia compared to plain levobupivacaine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-645/v1?src=rss">Technology Support Fraud Analysis for the Elderly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Older adults often fall victim to technology (tech) support fraud, with criminals leveraging on psychological manipulation and perceived authority to exploit victims. Often unfamiliar with evolving digital threats, they may be particularly susceptible due to cognitive aging, social isolation, and trust in perceived authoritative figures. Despite growing awareness of cyber fraud, there are insufficient tailored fraud preventive strategies that address the specific vulnerabilities of older victims. This study investigates how psychological manipulation tactics influence compliance and reporting behavior among elderly victims of tech support fraud, filling a critical gap in fraud prevention research. Method The authors conducted a literature search on Google’s scholar to identify research papers related to elderly fraud and tech support scams. In addition, using qualitative analysis, the authors analyzed tech support fraud cases sourced from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to identify recurring themes in victim experiences. Three dominant themes emerged: emotional manipulation, perceived authority, and barriers to reporting. Scammers exploit fear and legitimacy, posing as trusted entities to gain compliance. Results Findings reveal that financial loss, shame, and family support affect victims’ likelihood of reporting these incidents. Victims who do not suffer monetary harm often refrain from reporting due to shame, embarrassment, or skepticism about law enforcement response. Family involvement appears to positively influence reporting behavior, reinforcing the importance of social networks in fraud prevention. Conclusion This study underscores the urgent need for targeted education programs that equip elderly individuals to recognize fraud tactics and report incidents irrespective of financial impact. It calls for fraud prevention strategies that incorporate accessible training materials, social network engagement, and multi-channel awareness campaigns. Future research should incorporate diverse data sources to expand and refine these findings and explore intervention strategies that mitigate psychological barriers to report fraud among elderly victims.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-644/v1?src=rss">Implementation of didactic strategies for assurance of learning with students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assurance of Learning is a process focused on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of education. It involves implementing practices, policies, and procedures intended to ensure the development of skills, competencies, and knowledge expected in a specific educational program or course. In the subjects Chemistry and General Chemistry I at the Universidad de La Sabana, persistent issues with low academic performance have resulted in rising course repetition rates, lack of motivation, and student dropout. Methods The present study examines targeted didactic strategies for students at risk of academic failure in these subjects, representing an innovation in the field of education and contributing to the domain of learning assurance in Chemistry. It was conducted under a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional design. A predictive trend analysis was carried out, and strategies were identified, selected, and implemented with consideration for students’ perceptions and assessments. Two samples were analyzed: a characterization sample of 411 students who took the subjects between the second semester of 2020 and the first semester of 2023, and an experimental sample comprising students from the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Results The results revealed that participation in the implemented strategies led to improved academic performance, particularly for students with lower Saber 11 scores. Strategy 1 (leveling course) showed the greatest positive impact, with statistically significant differences in performance. Moreover, students reported high satisfaction with the strategies, especially regarding their usefulness, engagement, and relevance. Conclusions These findings suggest that personalized and contextualized didactic strategies are effective in supporting students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry courses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-643/v1?src=rss">Vietnam's foreign policy (1945-1946): Proactive in a fragile independence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The August Revolution of 1945 established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the nascent government immediately faced immense challenges from external forces like French colonialists and Chiang Kai-shek’s army, alongside internal difficulties. In this precarious situation, diplomacy emerged as a crucial strategic tool for the Vietnamese revolution during the 1945-1946 period, demonstrating a skillful blend of struggle and negotiation to safeguard independence. Methods This study is grounded in the principles of dialectical and historical materialism, consistent with the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The main methods include: the historical method (systematic examination of events and policies), the logical method (reconstructing diplomatic strategies), intertextual analysis (comparing Party directives with diplomatic actions), critical discourse analysis (Ho Chi Minh’s statements), and comparative assessment (with other decolonization movements). Data were collected from declassified archival materials, legal texts, diplomatic records, and contemporary press. Results During 1945-1946, Vietnam implemented an independent, self-reliant, and open foreign policy based on principles of equality and mutual assistance, with the core objective of protecting independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This policy demonstrated strategic flexibility by conciliating Chiang Kai-shek’s forces to free up resources against the French, and by signing the Preliminary Accord and Provisional Agreement with France to gain time for resistance preparation. Vietnamese diplomacy also proactively established friendly relations with neighboring countries and major powers, sought international recognition, and committed to multilateral cooperation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. Conclusion In an extremely challenging situation, foreign affairs activities, under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, successfully protected Vietnam’s independence and enhanced the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s prestige. The strategic lessons on foreign policy thinking from 1945-1946 have become a firm foundation for Vietnam’s modern foreign policy. They emphasize the harmonious combination of national independence, socialism, genuine patriotism, and internationalism, striving towards the ultimate goal of building a “prosperous people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization” in Vietnam.

                Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

     alt="Cellular Organization and Migration Pathways of the Ventricular–Subventricular Zone in the Juvenile Swine Brain (Sus scrofa domesticus)"/>
<p>A detailed structural analysis of the juvenile swine ventricular–subventricular zone reveals four distinct cellular layers and diverse neuroblast migration routes, including pathways toward the olfactory bulb and cortical regions. These features underscore the swine brain's value as a translational model for studying postnatal neurogenesis in large-brained, gyrencephalic mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ), lining the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, is a major neurogenic region in the adult brain of many mammals. This study investigates the structural organization and cellular composition of the V-SVZ in the juvenile swine brain (3–5 months), providing novel insights into neuroblast migration in gyrencephalic species. Using immunohistochemistry combined with transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we redefined the cytoarchitecture of the swine V-SVZ, identifying four distinct cellular layers. Layer 1 consists of a pseudostratified epithelium of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive ependymal cells, whose cilia and microvilli extend into the ventricular lumen, frequently surrounding supraependymal axons. Beneath it, layer 2 is composed of astrocytic and radial glia processes and contains occasional clusters of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells with prominent microtubules and elongated cytoplasm, indicative of a migratory phenotype. Layer 3 is further subdivided into a low-cell-density sublayer 3a, enriched with myelinated axons and scattered DCX<sup>+</sup> clusters, and a high-cell-density sublayer 3b, characterized by large groups of DCX<sup>+</sup> migratory cells. In sagittal sections, these cells form long chains oriented parallel to the ventricular surface. Neuroblasts emerging from the dorsal V-SVZ migrate caudorostrally through the rostral migratory stream toward the olfactory bulb. The layered organization of the swine V-SVZ resembles that of humans, where DCX<sup>+</sup> chains persist up to 18 months of age, positioning the swine as a valuable model for investigating postnatal plasticity and neurogenic potential in gyrencephalic brains. The persistence of immature neurons in the V-SVZ of gyrencephalic mammals, including infant humans, underscores the relevance of this region for neurogenesis and plasticity in large-brained species.</p>

                Wu et al. developed a graph deep learning-based algorithm, “DeepMeta,” that can accurately predict the metabolic vulnerability of cancer patients based on the transcriptome and metabolic network information. DeepMeta can reveal metabolic dependency and provide new strategies for targeting cancer with undruggable driver mutations.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 03 July 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01710-4">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01710-4</a></p>Programmable nonlinearities — including control over the response order up to high orders — can now be realized on-chip at ultralow power via field programmability. This advance paves the way for more scalable and energy-efficient photonic computing in applications such as machine learning, optical signal processing and communications, analogue computing and quantum photonics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96414">The human cytomegalovirus-encoded pUS28 antagonizes CD4+ T cell recognition by targeting CIITA</a></h4>

              
                Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a relevant pathogen, especially for individuals with impaired immunity. Harnessing potent immune antagonists, HCMV circumvents sterile immunity. Given that HCMV prevents the upregulation of <i>human leukocyte antigen</i> (HLA)-DP and HLA-DR, we screened a library of HCMV genes by co-expression with the HLA class II (HLA-II)-inducing transcription coordinator <i>class II transactivator</i> (CIITA). We identified the latency regulator pUS28 as an interaction factor and potent viral antagonist of CIITA-driven expression of CD74, HLA-DR, HLA-DM, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. Both wt-pUS28 and a mutant incapable of inducing G protein-coupled signaling (R129A), but not a mutant lacking the C-terminus, drastically reduced the CIITA protein abundance post-transcriptionally. While control CD4 + T cells from HCMV-seropositive individuals vigorously responded to CIITA-expressing cells decorated with HCMV antigens, pUS28 expression was sufficient to inhibit HLA-II induction and immune recognition by HCMV-specific CD4 + T cells. Our data uncover pUS28 to be employed by HCMV to evade HLA-II-mediated recognition by CD4 + T cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104996">Intrinsic dynamic shapes responses to external stimulation in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of ‘functional connectivity’ and ‘encoding models’, to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas have mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103636">Elucidating the selection mechanisms in context-dependent computation through low-rank neural network modeling</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals exhibit a remarkable ability to selectively filter out irrelevant information based on context. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this context-dependent selection process remain elusive. Recently, the issue of discriminating between two prevalent selection mechanisms—input modulation versus selection vector modulation—with neural activity data has been highlighted as one of the major challenges in the study of individual variability underlying context-dependent decision-making (CDM). Here, we investigated these selection mechanisms through low-rank neural network modeling of the CDM task. We first showed that only input modulation was allowed in rank-one neural networks and additional dimensions of network connectivity were required to endow neural networks with selection vector modulation. Through rigorous information flow analysis, we gained a mechanistic understanding of why additional dimensions are required for selection vector modulation and how additional dimensions specifically contribute to selection vector modulation. This new understanding then led to the identification of novel neural dynamical signatures for selection vector modulation at both single neuron and population levels. Together, our results provide a rigorous theoretical framework linking network connectivity, neural dynamics, and selection mechanisms, paving the way towards elucidating the circuit mechanisms when studying individual variability in context-dependent computation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101830">C-C chemokine receptor 4 deficiency exacerbates early atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation via dysregulation of T cell immune responses is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Improving the balance between proinflammatory T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis. Although C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to mediate the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues, its role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype. This was associated with the augmentation of proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic lymph nodes, and atherosclerotic aorta. Mechanistically, CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their suppressive function and tended to inhibit their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta, and subsequently augmented Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through defective regulation of dendritic cell function, which accelerated aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development. Thus, we revealed a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in controlling the early stage of atherosclerosis via Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99752">Heterogeneous efflux pump expression underpins phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial peptides</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance threatens the viability of modern medical interventions. There is a dire need to develop novel approaches to counter resistance mechanisms employed by starved or slow-growing pathogens that are refractory to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been advocated as potential therapeutic solutions due to the low levels of genetic resistance observed in bacteria against these compounds. However, here we show that subpopulations of stationary phase <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> survive tachyplesin treatment without acquiring genetic mutations. These phenotypic variants display enhanced efflux activity to limit intracellular peptide accumulation. Differential regulation of genes involved in outer membrane vesicle secretion, membrane modification, and protease activity was also observed between phenotypically resistant and susceptible cells. We discovered that the formation of these phenotypic variants could be prevented by administering tachyplesin in combination with sertraline, a clinically used antidepressant, suggesting a novel approach for combatting antimicrobial-refractory stationary phase bacteria.

                Membrane potential plays a crucial role in various cellular functions. However, existing techniques for measuring membrane potential are often invasive or have limited recording depth. In contrast, MRI offers noninvasive imaging with desirable spatial resolution over large areas. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing MRI to detect responses of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortex to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions by measuring magnetic resonance parameters. Our findings reveal that depolarizing (or hyperpolarizing) ionic solutions increase (or decrease) the <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> relaxation time, while the ratio of bound to free water protons shows the opposite trend. These findings also suggest a potential approach to noninvasively detect changes in membrane potential using MRI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101850">Assemblies, synapse clustering, and network topology interact with plasticity to explain structure-function relationships of the cortical connectome</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity underlies the brain’s ability to learn and adapt. While experiments in brain slices have revealed mechanisms and protocols for the induction of plasticity between pairs of neurons, how these synaptic changes are coordinated in biological neuronal networks to ensure the emergence of learning remains poorly understood. Simulation and modeling have emerged as important tools to study learning in plastic networks, but have yet to achieve a scale that incorporates realistic network structure, active dendrites, and multi-synapse interactions, key determinants of synaptic plasticity. To rise to this challenge, we endowed an existing large-scale cortical network model, incorporating data-constrained dendritic processing and multi-synaptic connections, with a calcium-based model of functional plasticity that captures the diversity of excitatory connections extrapolated to in vivo-like conditions. This allowed us to study how dendrites and network structure interact with plasticity to shape stimulus representations at the microcircuit level. In our exploratory simulations, plasticity acted sparsely and specifically, firing rates and weight distributions remained stable without additional homeostatic mechanisms. At the circuit level, we found plasticity was driven by co-firing stimulus-evoked functional assemblies, spatial clustering of synapses on dendrites, and the topology of the network connectivity. As a result of the plastic changes, the network became more reliable with more stimulus-specific responses. We confirmed our testable predictions in the MICrONS datasets, an openly available electron microscopic reconstruction of a large volume of cortical tissue. Our results quantify at a large scale how the dendritic architecture and higher-order structure of cortical microcircuits play a central role in functional plasticity and provide a foundation for elucidating their role in learning.

">Ptbp1 is not required for retinal neurogenesis and cell fate specification.</a></h4>

              
                The RNA-binding protein Ptbp1 has been proposed as a master regulator of neuronal fate, repressing neurogenesis through its effects on alternative splicing and miRNA maturation. While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following Ptbp1 loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted Ptbp1 in retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and Muller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-Seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in Ptbp1 mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-Seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of Ptbp1 in mature glia. Our findings demonstrate that Ptbp1 is dispensable for retinal development and suggest that its proposed role as a central repressor of neurogenesis should be reevaluated.

">AxoMetric: A Rapid and Unbiased Tool for Automated Quantification of Axon Regeneration in Tissue Sections</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in experimental strategies that promote axon regeneration in adult mammals lay the foundation for future therapies. Reliable and unbiased quantification of regenerated axons is challenging, yet essential for comparing the efficacy of individual treatments and identification of most efficacious combinatorial therapies. Here, we introduce AxoMetric, a user-friendly and freely available software for the rapid quantification of regenerated axons in longitudinal nerve tissue sections. AxoMetric automatically identifies and traces regenerated axons, generating quantitative measurements that closely match conventional manual quantification but with significantly greater speed. Key features include length-dependent axon quantification at defined intervals from the injury site and normalization of axon density to nerve diameter to account for anatomical variability. To facilitate high-throughput analysis, the software includes an image queuing function. Additional features of AxoMetric allow quantification of a range of labeled cellular structures. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate accurate quantification of regenerated axons in the optic nerve, retinal ganglion cells density in retinal flat-mounts, and regenerated axon bundles in injured sciatic nerves. Collectively, we introduce a new platform that is expected to streamline and standardize regenerative outcome assessments across diverse experimental conditions and laboratories.

">Piccolo Regulates Secretion of the Extracellular Matrix Components Brevican and Tenascin R from Astrocytes to Drive Synapse Formation: Implications for Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 (PCH3)</a></h4>

              
                Background: Astrocytes are crucial for CNS health, for instance via the secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that are vital for synapse formation and maturation. While the scaffolding protein Piccolo is known for its role at synapses, its function in astrocytes and contribution to neurodegenerative disorders like Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 (PCH3) are largely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is key to elucidating PCH3 pathology. Methods: We used a multi-faceted approach with a Pclogt/gt rat model. Methods included RNA-sequencing for gene expression and GO analysis. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry assessed Piccolo localization, ECM component (Brevican [Bcan], Tenascin-R [TNR]) levels, distribution, and secretion in brain sections and primary astrocytes. Golgi morphology was evaluated via GM130 staining. Neuronal network formation and function were investigated by co-culturing wild-type neurons with Pclowt/wt or Pclogt/gt astrocytes in a Banker setup, assessing synapse density (immunostaining, RRP electrophysiology) and spontaneous activity (mEPSCs, mIPSCs). Astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) experiments determined secreted factor roles. Results: RNA-seq showed significant DEG increases in older versus young Pclogt/gt rats (P25 vs. P5), which were strongly enriched in cell communication, signaling, and ECM GO terms. We identified a novel astrocyte-specific Piccolo isoform that partially localizes at the Golgi. Piccolo gene trap transposon mutation led to impaired ECM secretion (reduced extracellular Bcan, altered TNR) from astrocytes, correlating with a fragmented Golgi in Pclogt/gt astrocytes. Functionally, Pclogt/gt astrocytes significantly reduced synapse density and altered intrinsic activity (increased mEPSC frequency) in neuronal networks. This synaptic deficit was substantially rescued by Pclowt/wt astrocyte conditioned media (ACM). Conclusion: Our findings reveal a critical, unrecognized role for Piccolo in regulating astrocytic ECM secretion, essential for proper neuronal network formation and activity. Astrocytic Piccolo dysfunction disrupts this process, causing impaired synaptogenesis and altered intrinsic network activity, providing a novel cellular and molecular mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases like PCH3 and highlights astrocytes as potential therapeutic targets.

">Simultaneous cortical tracking of competing speech streams during attention switching</a></h4>

              
                Successful speech communication in multi-talker scenarios requires a skilful combination of sustained attention and rapid attention switching. While the neurophysiology literature offers detailed insights into the neural underpinnings of sustained attention, there remains considerable uncertainty on how attention switching takes place. In this study, using EEG recordings from normal-hearing adults in an immersive multi-talker environment, we measured the neural encoding of two competing speech streams amid background babble. Participants were cued to switch attention between streams every 15-30 seconds. Neural tracking was assessed via Temporal Response Functions (TRF), confirming reliable decoding of attentional focus. Our results indicate asymmetric disengagement and engagement processes during attention switches, where the neural tracking of the new target stream emerges before disengaging from the previous target, revealing a transient simultaneous encoding of two speech streams. That transition was closely mirrored by a reduction in EEG alpha power, informing on the cognitive effort during different phases of the attention switch. We then isolated cortical activity reflecting lexical prediction mechanisms to determine how lexical context is updated after an attention switch, comparing four numerical hypotheses that were constructed using Large Language Models. Our findings elucidate both the temporal and contextual mechanisms underlying auditory attention shifts, pointing to the possibility that listeners carry out a reset in lexical context after switching attention. By focusing on dynamic attentional reallocation, this study offers insights into the brain's capacity for flexible speech processing in complex listening environments.

">Distinct neural architectures underlie motor skill acquisition and transfer in human sensorimotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning typically emerges from repetitive practice but can also arise through transfer or generalization, where improvements extend to untrained actions. While training-based (training effect) and transfer/generalization-based (transfer effect) learning often result in comparable motor performance, little is known about the extent to which they share similar neural underpinnings or if they are two separate phenomena that rely on distinct cortical architecture. Here, we employed between-subject multivariate decoding of hyperaligned functional data obtained with high-field (7 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the universal neural codes underlying the training and transfer effects, and compared their resultant motor engrams in the sensorimotor cortex. We found that both learning mechanisms have reliable neural representations that are shared across individual brains, highlighting similar representational geometry despite idiosyncratic functional topographies. While their codes are embedded in overlapping cortical areas, the training effect has a more stable representation centered in the primary sensorimotor cortex, indicative of execution-level learning. In contrast, transfer effects elicited more abstract, variable codes in adjacent premotor and postcentral areas, suggesting flexible recombination of motor chunks. Moreover, the resultant cortical engrams shaped by them are particularly distinct in the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus, and in the right side of the superior part of the precentral sulcus, postcentral gyrus and postcentral sulcus. Our findings support the notion that motor skill learning is hierarchically organized in the sensorimotor cortex, and extend current models by revealing how training and transfer encode distinct, mechanism-dependent, and high-dimensional representations embedded in a neural code that is shared across brains.

">Causal inference shapes crossmodal postdictive perception within the temporal window of multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                In our environment, stimuli from different sensory modalities are processed within a temporal window of multisensory integration that spans several hundred milliseconds. During this window, the processing and perception of stimulus are influenced not only by preceding and current information, but also by input that follows the presentation of the stimulus. To date, the computational mechanisms underlying crossmodal backward processing, which we refer to as crossmodal postdiction, are not well understood. In this study, we examined crossmodal postdiction in the audiovisual (AV) rabbit illusion, in which postdiction occurs when flash-beep pairs are presented shortly before and shortly after a single flash or a single beep. We collected behavioral data from 32 human participants and fitted four competing models: a Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model, a forced-fusion (FF) model, forced-segregation (FS) model, and a non-postdictive BCI (BCI-NP) model. The BCI model fit the data well and outperformed the other models. Building on previous findings demonstrating causal inference during non-postdictive multisensory integration, our study shows that the BCI framework is also an effective means of explaining crossmodal postdiction. Observers accumulate causal evidence that can retroactively influence the crossmodal perception of preceding sensory stimuli following the causal decision. Our study demonstrates that the AV rabbit illusion forms within a temporal window of multisensory integration that encompasses past, present, and future sensory inputs, and that this integration can be effectively explained by the Bayesian causal inference framework.

">Developmental and Aging Changes in Brain Network Switching Dynamics Revealed by EEG Phase Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior depends on the brains capacity to vary its activity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, how distinct facets of this variability evolve from childhood to older adulthood remains poorly understood, limiting mechanistic models of neurocognitive aging. Here, we characterize lifespan neural variability using an integrated empirical-computational approach. We analyzed high-density EEG cohort data spanning 111 healthy individuals aged 9-75 years, recorded at rest and during passive and attended auditory oddball stimulation task. We extracted scale-dependent measures of EEG fluctuations amplitude and entropy, together with millisecond-resolved phase-synchrony networks in the 2-20 Hz range. Multi-condition partial least squares decomposition analysis revealed two independent lifespan trajectories. First, slow-frequency power, variance and complexity at longer timescales declined monotonically with age, indicating a progressive dampening of low-frequency fluctuations and large-scale coherence. Second, the temporal organization of phase-synchrony reconfigurations followed an inverted U-trend: young adults exhibited the slowest yet most diverse switching--characterized by low mean but high variance and low kurtosis of jump lengths at 2-6 Hz and the opposite pattern at 8-20 Hz--whereas children and older adults showed faster, more stereotyped dynamics. To mechanistically account for these patterns, we fitted a ten-node phase-oscillator model constrained by the human structural connectome. Only an intermediate, metastable coupling regime reproduced the empirical combination of reduced low-frequency variability and maximally heterogeneous synchrony dynamics observed in young adults, while deviations toward weaker or stronger coupling mimicked the childrens and older adults profiles. Our results demonstrate that development and aging entail changes in the switching dynamics of EEG phase synchronization, by differentially sculpting stationary and transient aspects of neural variability. This establishes time-resolved phase-synchrony metrics as sensitive, mechanistically grounded markers of neurocognitive status across the lifespan.

">Timing, movement, and reward contributions to prefrontal and striatal ramping activity</a></h4>

              
                Across species, prefrontal and striatal neurons exhibit time-dependent ramping activity, defined as a consistent monotonic change in firing rate across temporal intervals. However, it is unclear if ramping activity is related to the cognitive process of estimating time, or to other behavioral factors such as anticipating reward or regulating movements. Here, we harnessed two novel approaches to determine how these factors contribute to prefrontal and striatal ramping activity in mice performing an interval timing task. First, to determine how movement contributes to ramping activity, we tracked movement velocity using DeepLabCut as well as task-specific movements while recording prefrontal or striatal ensembles during interval timing. We found that time was more accurately decoded by ramping neurons than movement-modulated neurons, with the exception of prefrontal velocity-modulated neurons. Second, to disambiguate temporal signals from anticipatory reward signals we compared activity patterns in neurons that were recorded during interval timing to the same neurons recorded during a Pavlovian conditioning task. We found more ramping activity and more accurate temporal decoding by neuronal ensembles during interval timing compared to Pavlovian conditioning. Together, these data quantify contributions of time estimation, movement, and reward anticipation in prefrontal and striatal ensembles, and they suggest that ramping is a cognitive signal that estimates time. Our results provide insight into how prefrontal and striatal ensembles multiplex information to effect temporal control of action.

">Prior Information Shapes Perceptual Evidence Accumulation Dynamics Differentially in Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Humans rely on prior information to navigate sensory uncertainty: Such priors could shape the decision process before sensory evidence is gathered (origin model), or could amplify sensory evidence dynamically (gain model). Dysfunctionalities in the utilisation of priors may underlie hallucinatory percepts and delusional ideation in psychosis, yet their impact on decision-making across sensory modalities has remained unclear. Using a perceptual target-detection task across auditory and visual domains in laboratory and online samples, we applied hierarchical drift diffusion modelling to examine how prior probabilities shape evidence accumulation in clinical and non-clinical populations. We show that in healthy individuals, prior information enhances sensory gain and decision flexibility, as represented by drift criterion and rate, consistent with the gain model. In contrast, individuals with psychosis exhibit diminished sensory gain, relying instead on pre-evidence biases, consistent with the origin model. Notably, greater positive symptom severity predicted a reduction in traditional criterion decision bias. These results suggest that sensory gain deficits may serve as a computational marker for psychosis progression, linking dysfunctional prior use to perceptual aberrancies. By demonstrating how prior information modulates evidence accumulation across sensory modalities, our study advances the understanding of psychotic perception and decision-making, offering insights for computational psychiatry and fine-tuned clinical diagnostics.

">REMI: Reconstructing Episodic Memory During Intrinsic Path Planning</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position. In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals maintain grid and place representations together to support planning. Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.

">Early Detection of Neuroinflammation and White Matter Damage Following Dorsal Spinal Nerve Root Sectioning in a Nonhuman Primate Model</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Dorsal rhizotomy, or spinal dorsal nerve root lesioning, is a surgical procedure used to treat intractable nerve pain by selectively severing sensory afferent nerve roots. This study aimed to evaluate whether multiparametric MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT), and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), can sensitively detect structural and biochemical changes in the intact spinal cord following a focal dorsal nerve root section in a non-human primate model. Methods: In four squirrel monkeys, unilateral dorsal nerve roots at cervical segments C4 and C5 were surgically transected. MRI data were collected using a 9.4 T scanner with a custom saddle-shaped transmit-receive quadrature coil before and one week after lesioning. DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD); qMT-derived pool size ratio (PSR); and CEST and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effects were quantified across seven regions of interest. CEST and NOE effects were extracted using five-pool Lorentzian fitting of Z-spectra. Results: At the lesioned dorsal nerve root bundles, FA, PSR, and NOE(-1.6 ppm) values decreased, while RD and CEST(3.5 ppm) increased, consistent with fiber degeneration, demyelination, and inflammation. Similar, though less pronounced, changes were observed in the dorsal root entry zone, particularly within the first week post-lesion. Conclusion: Multiparametric MRI enables region-specific detection of early spinal cord pathology as soon as one week following dorsal nerve root injury. These findings support its potential as a noninvasive tool for monitoring secondary degeneration due to spinal nerve damage and for evaluating outcomes of therapeutic interventions.

">Neural mechanisms underlying reward processing and social cognition: a replication study with a Japanese sample</a></h4>

              
                Neural functions underlying reward processing and social cognition play a critical role in everyday decision-making. Given that these processes may be shaped by cultural factors, it is essential to examine their cross-cultural generalizability. In this study, we used functional MRI to scan native Japanese speakers as they performed two well-established experimental paradigms: the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task for reward processing and the Theory of Mind (ToM) task for social cognition. We successfully replicated previous findings. Specifically, in the MID task, reward expectation and reward outcome were associated with neural activity in the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In the ToM task, social cognition was linked to activation in the temporoparietal junction. Notably, the posterior cingulate cortex was engaged in both tasks, suggesting its integrative role across cognitive domains. Together, these results replicate and extend earlier work, supporting the cross-cultural generalizability of the neural mechanisms underlying reward and social cognition, and further validating our fMRI protocol for future research.

">Characterization of mice with cell type-specific Gnal loss of function provides insights on GNAL-linked dystonia</a></h4>

              
                Isolated dystonia can be caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GNAL gene (DYT-GNAL). This gene encodes the olf heterotrimeric G protein subunit, which, together with {beta}2{gamma}7 subunits, mediates the stimulatory coupling of dopamine D1 and adenosine A2A receptors to adenylyl-cyclase. These receptors are expressed in distinct striatal projection neurons (SPNs) with complementary functions on motor behavior. To dissect the specific roles of Golf in each subpopulation of SPNs, we generated and characterized mouse models in which Gnal was conditionally deleted in neurons expressing either D1 receptors (D1-SPNs) or A2A receptors (A2A-SPNs). Our results confirmed the critical role of Golf in regulating adenylyl-cyclase 5 and its coupling with D1 and A2A receptors. Mice with a selective loss of Golf in D1-SPNs showed nocturnal hyperactivity, deficits in motor performances, but no overt abnormal movements or generalized motor disability. Our experiments also revealed that Golf in D1-SPNs is not systematically required for locomotor responses induced by D1 agonists or psychostimulants. Selective loss of Golf in A2A-SPNs did not affect motor abilities nor learning. However, this loss strikingly increased spontaneous locomotor activity that was not further enhanced by psychostimulant drugs (cocaine, D-amphetamine, methylphenidate) or a selective A2 agonist, KW6002, and was paradoxically reduced by caffeine Our study identified specific roles of Golf downstream of D1 and A2A receptors in the control of motor behavior and drug responses, highlighting their respective individual contribution in diseases associated with dysfunctional striatal signaling, including dystonia.

">MoMo - Combining Neuron Morphology and Connectivity forInteractive Motif Analysis in Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, reconstructs structural and functional brain maps at synapse-level resolution. These complex spatial maps consist of tree-like neurons interconnected by synapses. Motif analysis is a widely used method for identifying recurring subgraph patterns in connectomes. These motifs, thus, potentially represent fundamental units of information processing. However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies. In this paper, we introduce MoMo, a novel interactive visualization framework for analyzing neuron morphology-aware motifs in large connectome graphs. First, we propose an advanced graph data structure that integrates both neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. This enables highly efficient, parallel subgraph isomorphism searches, allowing for interactive morphological motif queries. Second, we develop a sketch-based interface that facilitates the intuitive exploration of morphology-based motifs within our new data structure. Users can conduct interactive motif searches on state-of-the-art connectomes and visualize results as interactive 3D renderings. We present a detailed goal and task analysis for motif exploration in connectomes, incorporating neuron morphology. Finally, we evaluate MoMo through case studies with four domain experts, who asses the tools usefulness and effectiveness in motif exploration, and relevance to real-world neuroscience research. The source code for MoMo is available here: https: //github.com/VCG/momo

">Neural trajectories improve motor precision</a></h4>

              
                Populations of neurons in motor cortex signal voluntary movement. Most classic neural encoding models and current brain-computer interface decoders assume individual neurons sum together along a neural dimension to represent movement features such as velocity or force. However, large population neural analyses continue to identify trajectories of neural activity evolving with time that traverse multiple dimensions. Explanations for these neural trajectories typically focus on how cortical circuits processes learn, organize, and implement movements. However, descriptions of how these neural trajectories might improve performance, and specifically motor precision, are lacking. In this study, we proposed and tested a computational model that highlights the role of neural trajectories, through the selective co-activation and selective timing of firing rates across the neural populations, for improving motor precision. Our model uses experimental results from a center-out reaching task as inspiration to create several physiologically realistic models for the neural encoding of movement. Using a recurrent neural network to simulate how a downstream population of neurons might receive such information, like the spinal cord and motor units, we show that movements are more accurate when neural information specific to the phase and/or amplitude of movement are incorporated across time instead of an instantaneous, velocity-only tuning model. Our finding suggests that precise motor control arises from spatiotemporal recruitment of neural populations that create distinct neural trajectories. We anticipate our results will significantly impact not only how neural encoding of movement in motor cortex is described but also future understating for how brain networks communicate information for planning and executing movements. Our model also provides potential inspiration for how to incorporate selective activation across a neural population to improve future brain-computer interfaces.

">Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein interaction networks of the synapto-nuclear messenger CRTC1 in neurons reveal cooperative chromatin binding between CREB1 and CRTC1, MEF2C and RFX3</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic stimulation of excitatory neurons triggers the synapto-nuclear translocation of the cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), resulting in the transcription of CREB1 target genes. Whether and how CRTC1 and CREB1 interact with other transcription factors to regulate activity-dependent transcription, and what the role of CRTC1 is in neurons beyond the activation of CREB1 regulated transcription, remains unknown. To address these questions in an unbiased manner, we used proximity labeling to identify CRTC1-proximal proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of rodent forebrain neurons. The cytoplasmic CRTC1 proxisome included a variety of signaling pathways and downstream cellular processes involved in synaptic plasticity. In contrast, the nuclear CRTC1 proxisome included transcription factors that mediate activity-dependent transcription, chromatin factors, and splicing factors. Our data revealed that CRTC1 and CREB1 interact with MEF2C and RFX3 transcription factors in an activity-dependent manner. Thus, in chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments, CREB1 was prebound to chromatin regions containing bZIP motifs in a manner that was unchanged by neuronal activity, while glutamatergic stimulation triggered the recruitment of CRTC1 and CREB1 to activity-dependent enhancers enriched in motifs for MEF2C and RFX3. Collectively, these results not only enhance our understanding of the role of cytoplasmic and nuclear CRTC1 in neurons, but also reveal a role for CRTC1 in promoting cooperativity of CREB1 with other transcription factors in response to synaptic activity.

">Advancing Inter-brain Synchrony Measurement: A Comparative Hyperscanning Study of High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography and Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Inter-brain synchrony (IBS), measured by hyperscanning, refers to the synchronization of multiple individuals' brain activities during social interactions. Traditional fNIRS-based hyperscanning suffers shortcomings like low spatial resolution and high susceptibility to superficial interference, causing imprecise estimation of IBS in complex social tasks. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap by comprehensively assessing how high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an enhanced alternative to fNIRS, can benefit hyperscanning studies of complex social interactions. Sixteen dyads were engaged in both collaborative and individual tangram puzzle tasks, and their brain activities were recorded simultaneously using HD-DOT and fNIRS. We found that HD-DOT demonstrated significantly stronger IBS and identified more brain regions with significant IBS compared to fNIRS during the collaborative task. Specifically, while fNIRS detected IBS only in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), HD-DOT revealed additional IBS in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Additionally, compared to the individual task, the collaborative task showed increased IBS in HD-DOT, not only in the DLPFC but also in the SMG, frontal eye fields (FEF), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). By highlighting the superior spatial resolution and sensitivity of HD-DOT in capturing detailed and extensive neural activity during complex social interactions, our findings for the first time clarified the potential strengths of HD-DOT in measuring IBS over traditional fNIRS. These advances provide a stronger empirical foundation for investigating the neural basis of social interaction, paving the way for future research on real-world, dynamic group behaviors.

">Temporal and cell-specific changes to cellular iron sequestration and lipid peroxidation in a murine model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation are pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Characterization of spatiotemporal changes in these processes will help elucidate their role in ischemic neuronal injury as an initial step towards developing targeted interventions. Methods: HI was induced in post-natal day 9 mice using the modified-Vannucci model. Hippocampal tissue from ipsilateral HI exposed, contralateral hypoxia exposed and sham animals was collected at 6h, 24h, 72h and 7d post-HI. Tissue was subsequently evaluated for markers of cell death (TUNEL), intracellular iron changes (FerroOrange, fluorescent in situ and immunofluorescence), and lipid peroxidation (real time PCR, Gpx4 immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry). Mass spectrometry measured isoprostanes (15-F2t-IsoP) and neuroprostanes (4-F4t-NP) as lipid peroxidation markers of arachidonic (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively. Results: Compared to sham, the HI hippocampus showed increased intracellular labile iron levels that was maximal at 6h post-HI with subsequent elevation in only neuroprostanes at 24h post-HI. TUNEL labeling peaked at 24h post-HI. At 72h, labile iron levels and lipid peroxidation declined corresponding with peak infiltration of ferritin positive microglia/macrophages and the start of TUNEL staining decline. In addition, surviving neurons had increased expression of Gpx4 peaking at 72h post-HI that normalized by 7d post-HI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that following HI, an acute increase in labile iron and DHA peroxidation are correlated with markers of cell death that peak at 24h post-HI. Microglial/macrophage iron sequestration and neuronal antioxidant responses may ameliorate further injury and represent targets for neuroprotective therapies.

">Connectome analysis of a cerebellum-like circuit for sensory prediction</a></h4>

              
                Stable and accurate perception involves comparing incoming sensory input with internally-generated predictions. A mechanistic understanding of this process has been elusive due to the size and complexity of the relevant brain regions in mammals. Here we leverage connectomics to comprehensively map the cell types and synaptic connections underlying a well-characterized and ecologically relevant form of predictive sensory processing in the cerebellum-like electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric fish. Connectome analysis reveals highly-structured feedforward and recurrent synaptic connectivity mediating the cancellation of predictable electrosensory input. A computational model constrained by prior electrophysiological recordings shows how this connectivity supports the formation of predictions at multiple sites within the network and how the ELL solves a continual learning problem by maintaining fast and accurate predictions despite noise and changes in environmental context. Overall, these findings provide a blueprint for using connectomics to elucidate learning in vertebrate nervous systems.

">Dynamics of sensorimotor plasticity during exoskeletal finger augmentation</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain integrate artificial body extensions into its somatosensory representation? While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users' fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body-augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation. These results have direct implications for the design of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies aimed at extending human physical capacity.

">CACNA1C TS-II variants alter single-cell dynamics in computational models of cortical pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Timothy Syndrome (TS) is a rare multi-system disorder and a monogenic calcium channelopathy. Previous computational work on this disorder has focused on the myocardium, ignoring the effects of TS on neural development and its strong association with autism spectrum disorder. Variation in the TS-causative gene, CACNA1C, is indeed also associated with a variety of complex neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We apply computational methods, drawing on experimental data, to understand the mechanisms of calcium dysregulation in TS, and validate our findings in four well-established multi-compartmental neuronal models. CACNA1C encodes the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav1.2, which modulates neuronal excitability and several activity-dependent pathways. We investigate two mutations in CACNA1C causative of TS type II, G402R and G406R. Both variants show a loss of voltage-dependent inactivation and changes in their voltage dependence of activation. We incorporate the altered steady-state activity of these variants with additional morphological data indicating a significant increase in activity-dependent dendritic retraction of layer II/III pyramidal cells in TS mutant neurones. Our findings replicate experimental work suggesting that increased calcium flux reduces firing frequency but does not affect the rheobase current for action potential initiation. Furthermore, models expressing dendritic Cav1.2 current show altered apical-somatic signal integration in mutant neurones. All models with shortened dendrite morphology show hyperexcitability, denoted by reduced rheobase current and increased responsiveness to current injection compared to their full-length counterparts. Importantly, our approach identifies robust and testable predictions on the impacts of TS on single-cell dynamics. We also discuss the broader implications of our findings for other calcium channel-related neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">A single NPFR neuropeptide F receptor neuron that regulates thirst behaviors in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Thirst is a strongly motivated internal state that is represented in central brain circuits that are only partially understood. Water seeking is a discrete step of the thirst behavioral sequence that is amenable to uncovering the mechanisms for motivational properties such as goal-oriented behavior, value encoding, and behavioral competition. In Drosophila water seeking is regulated by the NPY-like neuropeptide NPF, however the circuitry for NPF-dependent water seeking is unknown. To uncover the downstream circuitry, we identified the NPF receptor NPFR and the neurons it is expressed in as being acutely critical for thirsty water seeking. Refinement of the NPFR pattern uncovered a role for a single neuron, the L1-l, in promoting thirsty water seeking. The L1-l neuron increases its activity in thirsty flies and is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons in long-term memory formation. Thus, NPFR and its ligand NPF, already known for its role in feeding behavior, are also important for a second ingestive behavior.

">Pre-stimulus alpha power modulates trial-by-trial variability in theta rhythmic multisensory entrainment strength and theta-induced memory effect</a></h4>

              
                Binding multisensory information into episodic memory depends partly on the timing of the hippocampal theta rhythm which provides time windows for synaptic modification. In humans, theta rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) enhances episodic memory when the stimuli are synchronised across the visual and auditory domain compared to when they are out-of-synchrony. However, recent studies show mixed evidence if the improvement in episodic memory is the result of modulating hippocampal theta activity. In the current study, we investigated whether pre-stimulus brain state could explain part of this variance in the neural and behavioural effects induced by the RSS, via recording participants' brain activity with MEG during a multisensory theta RSS memory paradigm. Our findings suggest that pre-stimulus alpha power modulates entrainment strength in sensory regions, which in turn predicts subsequent memory formation. These findings suggest that for non-invasive brain stimulation tools to be effective it is crucial to consider brain-state dependent effects.

">Inter-brain functional connectivity: Are we measuring the right thing?</a></h4>

              
                Hyperscanning - the simultaneous recording of brain activity from multiple individuals - and the study of inter-brain synchronization is gaining popularity in social neuroscience. MEG/EEG hyperscanning studies often estimate inter-brain functional connectivity using phase-based metrics applied to oscillatory brain signals, assuming matching peak frequencies between the individuals studied. However, in reality, peak frequencies typically differ between subjects and between brain regions. Using simulated MEG/EEG signals, we systematically assessed how inter-individual frequency differences affect commonly used connectivity measures. Phasebased metrics were highly sensitive to frequency differences across individuals, whereas amplitude envelope correlation remained robust, offering more reliable connectivity estimates. Our results underscore the need for connectivity metrics specifically tailored to inter-brain analyses. These findings are relevant to a range of disciplines that are increasingly integrating hyperscanning into their methodological toolkits.

">Boundary homogenization and numerical modeling of solute transport across the blood-brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                Effective clearance of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) from the brain is essential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. A significant portion of this clearance occurs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via receptor-mediated transport. However, current models fail to capture the complex kinetics and spatial heterogeneity of receptors at the BBB. In this study, we derive a novel boundary condition that accounts for finite receptor kinetics, receptor density, and bidirectional transport across the BBB. Specifically, we develop a nonlinear homogenized boundary condition that ensures mass conservation and incorporates receptor-mediated Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We then implement this boundary condition in a cylindrical geometry representing a capillary surrounded by brain tissue. After verifying that the model matches an analytical steady state solution that we derive and that it yields realistic blood A{beta} concentrations, we explore how realistic variations in parameter values drive changes in both steady state A{beta} concentration and transient dynamics. Simulations and analytical results reveal that A{beta} concentrations in the brain are sensitive to receptor number ratios, while concentrations in the blood are primarily affected by the blood clearance rate. Additionally, we use the model to investigate A{beta} clearance during sequential sleep cycles and due to a pathological phenomenon, spreading depolarization. This work presents the first biophysically consistent boundary condition for A{beta} transport across the BBB, offering a powerful tool for studying brain waste clearance under both physiological and pathological conditions.

">Parkinsons disease microglia induce endogenous alpha-Synuclein pathology in patient-specific midbrain organoids.</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons are hallmarks of Parkinsons disease (PD), contributing to the development of synucleinopathies. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding -synuclein's role in PD pathology, the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear. Human midbrain organoids (hMOs) have emerged as valuable models for studying PD, yet the lack of microglia limits the ability to investigate neuroimmune interactions. Recent studies show that integrating microglia into hMOs enhances neuronal maturation and functionality. Here, we generated a human midbrain assembloid model by incorporating iPSC-derived microglia into midbrain organoids from healthy control individuals and a PD patient carrying the SNCA triplication (3xSNCA) mutation. Our results show that 3xSNCA microglia alone are sufficient to induce early, endogenous formation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (pS129) pathology in the absence of exogenous fibril seeding. This PD-pathology emerged as early as day 50 of culture and was not observed in models lacking microglia. These findings highlight a critical role for patient-derived microglia in driving -synuclein pathology and provide a physiologically relevant platform for studying early neuroimmune mechanisms in PD and testing potential therapeutic strategies.

">Tonotopically distinct OFF responses arise in the mouse auditory midbrain following sideband suppression</a></h4>

              
                The parsing of sensory information into discrete topographic domains is a fundamental principle of sensory processing. In the auditory cortex, these domains evolve during a stimulus, with the onset and offset of tones evoking distinct spatial patterns of neural activity. However, it is not known where in the auditory system this spatial segregation occurs or how these dynamics are affected by hearing loss. Using widefield single photon neuronal Ca2+ imaging in the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake mice, we found that pure tone stimuli elicited both spatially constrained neural activity within isofrequency bands and simultaneous sideband suppression. At cessation of the stimulus, offset responses emerged within the region of sideband suppression, demonstrating that simple stimuli elicit spatiotemporally distinct neural activity patterns to represent the presence of sound and sound termination. Because sound frequency is spatially encoded in the IC, this spatial shift creates a tonotopically distinct offset (tdOFF) response relative to sound onset. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging confirmed that tdOFF neuron activity in the sideband region was suppressed during sound and elevated above baseline after stimulus termination, raising the possibility that rebound excitation could contribute to this post-stimulus activation. Loud noise exposure, a common model of hearing loss, abolished both sideband suppression and tdOFF responses. These results show that hearing loss profoundly reshapes the spatiotemporal pattern of sound processing by altering sideband activity. This preferential loss of sideband suppression and tdOFF activation after sound-induced injury in the auditory midbrain may contribute to hyperacusis and tinnitus by promoting neuronal hyperactivity.

">Comparison of AAV9-driven motor neuron transduction following different CNS-directed delivery methods in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gene therapies are promising for diseases previously considered incurable. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) demonstrates remarkable tropism for motor neurons (MNs) and represents an exciting candidate to target genetic causes of motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, systemic delivery risks immunogenicity and off-target effects, therefore localised delivery to the CNS is advantageous. New method: We assessed MN transduction in wild-type mice using AAV9-controlled, cytomegalovirus-promoter driven, enhanced GFP expression. Intra-cisterna magna (ICM) and intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) methods were compared. Four weeks post-delivery, GFP positivity in MN and astrocytes were quantified via immunohistochemical approaches and viral genome copy number determined by qPCR. Results: All delivery methods achieved high MN transduction in lumbar spinal cord (>68%). Unilateral ICV delivery provided the highest and most consistent levels (89 {+/-} 3%), and minimal peripheral viral copies. ICV delivery resulted in higher astrocytic transduction, most notably in the cortex. Brainstem MN transduction was high with all methods (>55%). We failed to find evidence of neuronal transduction in motor cortex. Viral genome copies trended higher in spinal cord and brainstem with ICV approaches, however further work is required to understand how bilateral delivery leads to such profound increases. Comparison to existing methods: Whilst several routes of administration into cerebrospinal fluid exist, direct comparisons for targeting MNs in vivo remain limited. Conclusions: Overall, consideration of gene therapy delivery methods is critical to ensure that the most appropriate administration route is chosen to reach MNs effectively, selectively, and at high levels to exact biological effects.

">The Contribution of Audition and Proprioception in Unisensory and Multisensory Target Reaching</a></h4>

              
                Everyday actions often involve reaching for targets sensed by auditory and proprioceptive senses (reaching a ringing smartphone in the dark or tapping on it while holding it with the other hand). However, it is still unclear whether reaching performance toward auditory and proprioceptive targets is modality-specific and whether performance improves under multisensory compared to unisensory conditions. Here, we addressed these questions by measuring reaching performance toward auditory, proprioceptive, and combined audio-proprioceptive targets. Accuracy was generally similar across conditions, but precision was lower for auditory targets compared to proprioceptive and audio-proprioceptive targets. A second experiment investigated whether providing additional proprioceptive information while reaching for an auditory target could improve precision in subsequent auditory-only trials. A slight improvement was observed, indicating that proprioceptive cues may help reduce spatial variability in auditory-guided actions, though not to the level seen in the multisensory condition. Overall, the results suggest that while the target modality slightly impacts movement accuracy, it has a significant impact on movement precision, with proprioceptive input playing a crucial role in enhancing precision. The concurrent availability of auditory and proprioceptive target information does not enhance precision beyond that achieved with proprioceptive information alone, whereas proprioception can modestly improve subsequent auditory-guided reaching.

">Inferior Reinnervation of Reverse End-to-Side Nerve Transfer in a Delayed Nerve Repair Rat Model</a></h4>

              
                Objective Reverse end-to-side (RETS) nerve transfer is a recent surgical technique to augment injured nerve function by supplying a dispensable donor motor nerve to the side of the distal injured nerve. Although clinical studies have suggested advantages of RETS transfer for upper extremity repairs, uncertainties remain regarding its underlying mechanism. Furthermore, our recent clinical studies using electrophysiological examinations revealed no contribution from the donor nerve. Given that most experimental studies were conducted on acutely injured nerves, our objective is to reassess the effectiveness of reverse end-to-side nerve transfer in a model of chronic nerve injury and repair. Methods Obturator and femoral nerve were used as donor and recipient nerves, respectively. Electromyogram (EMG), retrograde labeling of regenerated motoneurons and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation were used to compare regenerative ability of donor nerve in acute and delayed RETS transfer where the femoral nerve in the latter group was injured 8 weeks prior. Nerve- babysitting effect on injured nerve was investigated by 1) no intervention; 2) perineurial window creation; and 3) RETS transfer to femoral nerve in delayed repair model. The effects of availability of regeneration tracks, i.e. bands of bungner, were investigated by severing proximal femoral nerve with subsequent acute and delayed repairs. Results EMG and motoneuron quantification confirmed inferiority of donor nerve regeneration into recipient nerve in delayed RETS transfer compared to acute repair, yet donor axons reached target muscle and formed NMJs in both conditions. Same functional assessments revealed nerve baby-sitting effects did not significantly contribute to repair success but availability of regeneration tracks in the recipient nerve may influence the final outcomes. Conclusions Our study offered insights into the effectiveness of RETS nerve transfer in clinically relevant settings, underscoring the compounded impact of delayed intervention and native nerve regeneration which both negatively affect the efficacy of RETS nerve transfer.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Nonhuman primates, particularly rhesus macaques, have served as crucial animal models for investigating complex brain functions. While previous studies have explored neural activity features in macaques, the gyro-sulcal functional dissociation characteristics are largely unknown. In this study, we employ a deep learning model named one-dimensional convolutional neural network to differentiate resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals between gyri and sulci in macaque brains, and further investigate the frequency-specific dissociations between gyri and sulci inferred from the power spectral density of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Experimental results based on a large cohort of 440 macaques from two independent sites demonstrate substantial frequency-specific dissociation between gyral and sulcal signals at both whole-brain and regional levels. The magnitude of gyral power spectral density is significantly larger than that of sulcal power spectral density within the range of 0.01 to 0.1 Hz, suggesting that gyri and sulci may play distinct roles as the global hubs and local processing units for functional activity transmission and interaction in macaque brains. In conclusion, our study has established one of the first power spectrum maps of gyro-sulcal functional activity dissociation in macaque brains, providing a novel perspective for systematically exploring the neural mechanism of functional dissociation in mammalian brains.</span>

However, its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Using a novel shyness-induction paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain activation and connectivity patterns associated with state shyness in 41 healthy adults (25 females; M<sub>age</sub> = 21.41 ± 2.56). State shyness elicited increased activity in social processing regions, including the bilateral superior temporal, left middle temporal, and medial superior frontal regions. On the network level state shyness decreased connectivity within a regulatory frontal network encompassing dorsomedial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, superior, and inferior frontal systems. No effect on amygdala activation or connectivity was observed. These findings highlight distinct neural correlates of state shyness, emphasizing its reliance on prefrontal and temporal regions for immediate emotion regulation and social cognitive control. Moreover, the results differentiate state shyness from trait shyness, with the latter more closely linked to sustained interactions between the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, especially the amygdala. By elucidating the neural underpinnings of state shyness, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the situational and transient nature of shy responses in dynamic social contexts.</span>

However, the mediating role of this affective component in declining TP in MCI and the influence of structural brain alterations on reduced TP via affect warrant further investigation. We conducted multiple mediation analyses to assess whether differences in TP between MCI and normal healthy controls (NHCs) were mediated by affect, motivation, executive function, and social cognition. Whole-brain mediation analyses identified neural substrates and moderated mediation analyses examined whether structural brain changes influenced TP via affect differently between the two groups. Our results revealed a significant mediating effect of affect on the group difference in TP. Atrophy within the thalamus and anterior insula (AI) in the MCI group was found to contribute to their diminished TP. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis showed that the influence of the thalamus and AI on TP was mediated by affect within the MCI group but not NHCs. These findings suggest that reduced TP in MCI is primarily driven by the increased sensitivity to betrayal, which is underpinned by structural alterations within salience network regions rather than alterations in other trust-related cognitive domains.</span>

                <p>The altered function of peripheral sensory neurons is an emerging mechanism for symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Visual sensitivities are common in autism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities is not well understood. This includes fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common syndromic cause of autism. We explored retinal function in the <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out mouse model of FXS. We focused on a specific type of retinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the "sustained On alpha" retinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular vision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in male <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out mice. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E&ndash;I balance. The change in E&ndash;I balance supports the maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in the cortex. However, this maintenance also reshapes the tuning of this retinal ganglion cell type. These results show that loss of <I>Fmr1</I> in the mouse retina affects the sensory function of one retinal neuron type. As other retinal cell types also express Fmr1, FXS may affect the tuning of retinal cells more broadly. Our findings suggest that the retina may be relevant for understanding visual function in FXS.</p>

                <p>Cocaine is an addictive psychostimulant, and the risk of developing cocaine use disorder (CUD) is highly heritable. Little is known about the specific genes and mechanisms that lead to the development of CUD, and there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies that can treat it. <I>Drosophila</I> has proven an effective model organism to identify genes and mechanisms underlying addiction, especially alcohol use disorder. While flies exposed to cocaine display features of acute intoxication like those observed in mammals, including hyperactivity and reduced sleep, to date, there is no model of preferential cocaine self-administration in flies. Here, we assayed cocaine consumption in <I>Drosophila</I> males, as well as preference in a two-choice paradigm. We also investigated mechanisms involved in cocaine taste sensing using genetic and imaging tools. We show that cocaine is innately aversive to flies and that this avoidance depends on bitter sensing. Gustatory sensory neurons expressing the Gr66a bitter receptor are activated upon exposure to cocaine. Silencing of these bitter-sensing neurons or mutation of <I>Gr66a</I> reduces cocaine avoidance. In a longitudinal choice assay, these flies develop preference for cocaine-containing solutions within 12&ndash;18&nbsp;h, whereas control flies do not. Our findings show that bitter sensation protects flies from developing cocaine self-administration preference. Conversely, silencing bitter perception enables us to use <I>Drosophila</I> as a model for experience-dependent cocaine self-administration preference. This opens the door to testing human variants associated with CUD for their causative role in cocaine self-administration in this highly tractable model organism.</p>

                <p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamatergic neurons participate in reward, aversion, drug-seeking, and stress. Subsets of these neurons cotransmit glutamate and GABA (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons), transmit glutamate without GABA (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons), or cotransmit glutamate and dopamine (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons), but whether these molecularly distinct subpopulations show behavior-related differences is not wholly understood. We identified in male and female mice that VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulations are sensitive to the reward value in unique ways. VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons increased maximum activity with increased sucrose concentration, whereas VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons increased maximum and sustained activity with increased sucrose concentration, and VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons increased sustained but not maximum activity with increased sucrose concentration. VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulations also uniquely signaled consumption of sweet/noncaloric (saccharine) and nonsweet/high-calorie rewards (fat). VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons uniquely signaled lower-calorie sucrose over fat, whereas both VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons and VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons showed a signaling preference for higher-calorie fat over sucrose but in temporally distinct ways. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by prefeeding, and not dependent on caloric content. Additionally, aversive stimuli increased activity for each VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulation, but VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons during low-intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion. About half of VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> sucrose-sensitive neurons were transcriptionally activated by footshock. We interpret these data such that VTA glutamatergic subpopulations signal different elements of rewarding and aversive experiences and highlight the unique role of VTA VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons in salience signaling. </p>

                <p>Early dorsal telencephalon development is coordinated by an interplay of transcription factors that exhibit a graded expression pattern in neural progenitors. How they function together to orchestrate cortical development remains largely unknown. The <I>Emx2</I> and <I>Dmrta2</I> genes encode transcription factors that are expressed in a similar caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient in the ventricular zone of the developing dorsal telencephalon with, in the medial pallium, <I>Dmrta2</I> but not <I>Emx2</I> expressed in the developing choroid plexus (ChP). Their constitutive loss has been shown to impart similar cortical abnormalities, and their combined deletion exacerbates the phenotypes, suggesting possible cooperation during cortex development. In this study, using embryos of both sexes, we utilized molecular and genetic approaches to dissect how Emx2 functions with Dmrta2 during mouse cortical development. Our results show that while they regulate a similar set of genes, their common direct targets are limited but include key regulators of cortical development. The identification of the interaction partners of Emx2 suggests that it coordinates with the LIM domain-binding protein Ldb1 to execute the activation and repression of some of its downstream targets. Finally, while <I>Emx2</I> is known to suppress ChP development, we also provide evidence that <I>Dmrta2</I> is, in contrast, required for ChP since in its absence in medial telencephalic progenitors, mice develop hydrocephalus postnatally, a phenotype that appears to be due to a compromised cytoarchitecture. Together, these data indicate that Emx2 and Dmrta2 have similar but also distinct functions in telencephalon development and provide the first insights into Emx2 mechanism of action.</p>

                <p>Aberrant signaling within cortical inhibitory microcircuits has been identified as a common signature of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interneuron (IN) activity is precisely regulated by neuromodulatory systems that evoke widespread changes in synaptic transmission and principal cell output. Cortical interneurons express high levels of opioid receptors, positioning opioid signaling as a critical regulator of inhibitory transmission; however, we lack a complete understanding of how classical opioid receptor systems regulate prefrontal cortex (PFC) microcircuitry. Here, we combine whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, and viral tools to provide an extensive characterization of how the Mu opioid receptor (MOR), Delta opioid receptor (DOR), and Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) regulate inhibitory transmission in male and female mice. We show that across these receptor systems, DOR activation is more effective at suppressing spontaneous inhibitory transmission in layer 2/3 of the prelimbic PFC, while MOR causes a greater acute suppression of electrically evoked GABA release, and KOR plays a minor role in inhibitory transmission. Cell type-specific optogenetics revealed that MOR and DOR differentially regulate inhibitory transmission from parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing INs. Finally, we demonstrate that DOR regulates inhibitory transmission through simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic modifications to IN physiology, whereas MOR function varies between somato-dendritic or presynaptic signaling depending on cell type.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/27/e2032242025?rss=1">Brain-Behavior Differences in Premodern and Modern Lineages of Domestic Dogs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although domestic dogs were the first domesticated species, the nature of dog domestication remains a topic of ongoing debate. In particular, brain and behavior changes associated with different stages of the domestication process have been difficult to disambiguate. Most modern Western breed dogs possess highly derived physical and behavioral traits because of intense artificial selection for appearance and function within the past 200&nbsp;years. In contrast, premodern dogs, including primitive/ancient breeds, village dogs, and New Guinea Singing Dogs, have undergone less intensive artificial selection and retain more ancestral characteristics. Consequently, comparisons between modern and premodern dogs can shed light on brain and behavior changes that have occurred recently in the domestication process. Here, we addressed this question using a voxel-based morphometry analysis of structural MRI images from 72 modern breed dogs and 13 premodern dogs (32 females). Modern breed dogs show widespread expansions of neocortex and reductions in the amygdala and other subcortical regions. Furthermore, cortical measurements significantly predicted individual variation in trainability, while amygdala measurements significantly predicted fear scores. These results contrast with the long-standing view that domestication consistently involves reduction in brain size and cognitive capacity. Rather, our results suggest that recent artificial selection has targeted higher-order brain regions in modern breed dogs, perhaps to facilitate behavioral flexibility and close interaction and cooperation with humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/27/e2084242025?rss=1">Neurophysiological Evidence of Sensory Prediction Errors Driving Speech Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human sensorimotor system has a remarkable ability to learn movements from sensory experience. A prominent example is sensorimotor adaptation, learning that characterizes the sensorimotor system's response to persistent sensory errors by adjusting future movements to compensate for those errors. A component of sensorimotor adaptation is implicit (i.e., the learner is unaware of the learning) which has been suggested to result from sensory prediction errors&mdash;discrepancies between predicted sensory consequences of motor commands and actual sensory feedback. However, neurophysiological evidence that sensory prediction errors drive adaptation has never been directly demonstrated. Here, we examined prediction errors via magnetoencephalography imaging of the auditory cortex during sensorimotor adaptation of speech to altered auditory feedback, an entirely implicit adaptation task. Specifically, we measured how speaking-induced suppression (SIS)&mdash;a neural representation of auditory prediction errors&mdash;changed over the trials of the adaptation experiment. In both male and female speakers, reduction in SIS (reflecting larger prediction errors) during the early learning phase compared with the initial unaltered feedback phase positively correlated with behavioral adaptation extents, suggesting larger prediction errors were associated with more learning. In contrast, such a reduction in SIS was not found in a control experiment in which participants heard unaltered feedback and thus did not adapt. In addition, in some participants who reached a plateau in the late learning phase, SIS increased, demonstrating that prediction errors were minimal when there was no further adaptation. Together, these findings provide the first direct neurophysiological evidence for the hypothesis that prediction errors drive sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

                <p>Stress profoundly affects sleep and memory processes. Stress impairs memory consolidation and, similarly, disruptions in sleep compromise memory functions. Yet, the neural circuits underlying stress-induced sleep and memory disturbances are still not fully understood. Here, we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH<sup>PVN</sup>), similar to acute restraint stress, decreases sleep and impairs memory in a spatial object recognition task in male mice. Conversely, inhibiting CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neurons during stress reduces stress-induced memory deficits while slightly increasing the amount of sleep. We found that both stress and stimulation of CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neurons activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and that CRH<sup>PVN</sup> projections to the LH regulate stress-induced memory deficits and sleep disruptions. Our results suggest that CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neuronal pathways regulate the adverse effects of stress on memory and sleep&mdash;an important step toward improving sleep and ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>Autapses are self-synapses formed by a single neuron. They selectively form in a subpopulation of neocortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells (PCs) where autaptic transmission provides strong feedback regulation of self-activity in individual neurons. PCs in the hippocampal formation (HPF) possess morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to neocortical PCs; it remains unclear, however, whether they form functional autapses. We performed whole-cell recording from HPF PCs in acute slices obtained from mice of either sex and found surprisingly that none of the recorded PCs in CA1&ndash;3 show autaptic responses; only a subpopulation of PCs (~50%) in the subiculum forms functional autapses, particularly those targeting to the nucleus accumbens. Further experiments reveal that the autaptic responses in subicular PCs are mediated solely by AMPA receptors but not NMDA receptors and occur much earlier than those of the medial prefrontal cortex during early development. Together, the results indicate that functional autapses selectively form in a considerable subset of subicular PCs but are completely absent from PCs in the hippocampus proper, suggesting a key role of autapses in regulating the self-activity of subicular PCs and thus the main output signals of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>by Albert J. Qü, Lung-Hao Tai, Christopher D. Hall, Emilie M. Tu, Maria K. Eckstein, Karyna Mishchanchuk, Wan Chen Lin, Juliana B. Chase, Andrew F. MacAskill, Anne G. E. Collins, Samuel J. Gershman, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal the difference between observed and predicted reward, known as reward prediction error, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches stochastically. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals that reflect dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison among a wide set of cognitive models based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched mesolimbic dLight measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation contributes to instrumental task performance in mice and is reflected in mesolimbic dopamine signaling.

                <p>by Seth R. Berke, Kanika Kanchan, Mary L. Marazita, Eric Tobin, Ingo Ruczinski</p>

As the biomedical data ecosystem increasingly embraces the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles to publish multimodal datasets to the cloud, opportunities for cloud-based research continue to expand. Besides the potential for accelerated and diverse biomedical discovery that comes from a harmonized data ecosystem, the cloud also presents a shift away from the standard practice of duplicating data to computational clusters or local computers for analysis. However, despite these benefits, researcher migration to the cloud has lagged, in part due to insufficient educational resources to train biomedical scientists on cloud infrastructure. There exists a conceptual lack especially around the crafting of custom analytic pipelines that require software not pre-installed by cloud analysis platforms. We here present three fundamental concepts necessary for custom pipeline creation in the cloud. These overarching concepts are workflow and cloud provider agnostic, extending the utility of this education to serve as a foundation for any computational analysis running any dataset in any biomedical cloud platform. We illustrate these concepts using one of our own custom analyses, a study using the case-parent trio design to detect sex-specific genetic effects on orofacial cleft (OFC) risk, which we crafted in the biomedical cloud analysis platform CAVATICA.

                <p>by Probir Kumar Ghosh, Md. Aminul Islam, Md. Ahshanul Haque, Md. Tariqujjaman, Novel Chandra Das, Mohammad Ali, Md. Rasel Uddin, Md. Golam Dostogir Harun</p>
Background <p>Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries. In Bangladesh, the Health Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program has shown effectiveness in resource-limited settings. Estimating causal relationships on hypertension while adjusting for nonlinear observed confounders in adult population is complex. This study aims to identify predictors of hypertension, and explore observational causal inference on hypertension.</p> Methods <p>The hypertension data was analyzed using Bangladesh Demographic and Health surveys data from the 2011 and 2022. We used 11,815 individuals aged 34 years and above. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of > 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mm Hg and/or having a history of hypertension. We used logistic regression, Random forest model, Double Machine Learning (DML), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) based on a pre-defined causal structure.</p> Results <p>The dataset included 11,815 individuals, and the prevalence of hypertension was 38.40%. The average age of individuals was 52.76 years (SD: 12.97), and 6826 (58.77%) were male. The Random forest model achieved 93% accuracy, with evaluation f1-scores of 95% for non-hypertension and 91% for hypertension, and identified older age, female gender, urban residency, workers, wealthier, self-awareness, and excessive body weight as key predictors of hypertension. The individual conditional expectation and SHAP plots reveal that age, and body mass index (BMI) are nonlinear relation with hypertension. The crude OR between excessive body weight and hypertension was 2.24 (95%CI: 2.07 – 2.42). Adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-awareness, the OR was 1.97 (95%CI: 1.79 – 2.17), and using de-biased method, it was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17 – 1.43).</p> Conclusion <p>The study highlights important predictors of hypertension, including age, sex, residency, and socioeconomic status (SES), self-awareness and body weight. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting hypertension. The de-biased methods provided a more refined risk estimate. Age and excessive body weight were found to significantly contributed to hypertension, demonstrating complex interactions and varying marginal effects across different levels of these factors. Awareness programs and targeted interventions are vital to effectively reduce excessive body weight and prevent hypertension.</p>

                Background Recently, prosthodontic utilization of zirconia-based materials has increased. There is insufficient research on the impact of MDP primers on zirconia bonding. This research was conceptualized to understand the impact of various surface preparation techniques, utilizing different abrasive powders and MDP primers, on the adhesive strength offered by zirconia copings. Methods Discs composed of 3Y-TZP zirconia measuring 18 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness were fabricated by milling fully sintered zirconia blanks that had been isostatically pressed. The samples were then classified into three categories. Group A, MDP primer; Group B, sandblasting with aluminum oxide; Group C, MDP priming and sandblasting with aluminum oxide. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, shear bond strength tests, and mode of failure analyses were performed. Results Thirty samples were analyzed. The shear bond strength test results showed that Group A had an average score of 8.62 ± 3.18 Group B had a lower value of 5.50 ± 1.78, and Group C had the highest value of 16.05 ± 8.91. The mode of failure among the three groups was found to have no statistically significant changes. Conclusion The application of MDP primers after air abrasion markedly enhanced the shear bond strength and surface roughness of zirconia, as opposed to the effects of each isolated method.

                Background University dropout among indigenous students is a multifactorial phenomenon that significantly impacts education and equity. This systematic review aimed to consolidate global evidence on risk and protective factors associated with university dropout among indigenous populations. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 criteria, encompassing ten databases (Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, Dialnet, PubMed/MEDLINE, Redalyc, Scielo, DOAJ, Latindex, and CLASE) from October 29, 2024, to November 30, 2024. Out of 23,403 initial records, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, analyzing indigenous university students and their educational trajectories. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction, ensuring minimized bias. Variables included demographic characteristics, geographic context, academic field, dropout rates, and related factors. Results were synthesized through descriptive analysis, focusing on quantitative data. Results Among the 226,049 participants across 21 studies, only 2,340 (1.03%) were indigenous university students, predominantly from South America (9/21 studies). The average dropout rate was 33.59%, ranging from 20% to 66%, with the highest rates reported among female students in six studies (28.57%). However, three studies highlighted higher dropout rates among male students (14.29%). Economic barriers were the primary risk factor (85.7%), followed by linguistic challenges (47.6%) and geographic limitations (33.3%). Protective factors included financial support (76.2%), academic mentorship (47.6%), and social support (42.8%). Public universities accounted for most participants (17/21 studies), with limited representation from private institutions. Despite significant dropout rates, only seven studies provided detailed prevalence data. Conclusion This review highlights systemic inequities contributing to indigenous university dropout, emphasizing economic, linguistic, and geographic barriers. While financial support and mentorship are effective interventions, their implementation remains inconsistent. Addressing these disparities through targeted policies, culturally inclusive curricula, and equitable resource distribution is essential to reducing dropout rates and fostering academic retention among indigenous students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-640/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Case report: Catheter rupture and migration into the pulmonary artery: A surgical intervention following failed percutaneous retrieval [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Port catheters are commonly used in oncology for chemotherapy, but they can sometimes rupture and migrate, leading to serious complications. Early detection and management are crucial, and surgical intervention may be required when less invasive approaches fail. This report highlights these rare but significant complications. A 57-year-old male, with no significant medical history, underwent surgery for sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and planned chemotherapy. His port catheter became nonfunctional, and on presentation, he was hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs. Chest radiography revealed catheter rupture, and thoracic angio-CT confirmed the fragment’s migration into the left pulmonary artery. After a failed percutaneous attempt, emergency surgery was performed via median sternotomy, successfully retrieving the catheter fragment. Catheter rupture and migration are rare complications, with an incidence of less than 1%. The clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic to severe, requiring a high index of suspicion. Imaging, including chest radiography and thoracic angio-CT, is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Management options include percutaneous retrieval, but surgery may be necessary when complications arise, as in this case. Preventive strategies, such as proper insertion and regular surveillance, are key in minimizing risks. Catheter rupture with migration is a life-threatening complication that requires urgent diagnosis and intervention. This case underscores the importance of vigilance in monitoring oncology patients with implantable devices and emphasizes the critical role of surgical intervention when less invasive approaches fail.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1504/v2?src=rss">The first mitochondrial genome of Haemagogus equinus from Jamaica [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In the Americas, the expansion in incidence of arboviral infections including Mayaro virus (MAYV) has drawn attention to the resurgence of viruses associated with understudied arthropods. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Haemagogus are generally geographically restricted to the forests of Central and South America and the Caribbean and are the known sylvan vectors for yellow fever virus and emerging MAYV. With an established population in Jamaica, Haemagogus equinus has been reported to be well-adapted to oviposition in artificial containers close to human populations. Its role in arboviral transmission however is not fully understood. Given the dearth of genetic information and the difficulty in morphologically identifying cryptic features in species belonging to this genus, we report the first mitochondrial genome of Hg. equinus. Using a genome skimming approach, two Hg. equinus mosquito specimens were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. A representative mitogenome of 16,471 bp, 80.7% AT and 37 genes was assembled using NOVOplasty. Phylogenetic analysis placed Hg. equinus in the Albomaculatus section of the Haemagogus subgenus supporting previously described taxonomic studies.
