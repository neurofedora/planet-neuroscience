	<p>The brain lesions images of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients are slightly different from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging of normal people, and the classification effect of general image recognition technology is not ideal. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s datasets are small, making it difficult to train large-scale neural networks. In this paper, we propose a network model (WS-AMN) that fuses weak supervision and an attention mechanism. The weakly supervised data augmentation network is used as the basic model, the attention map generated by weakly supervised learning is used to guide the data augmentation, and an attention module with channel domain and spatial domain is embedded in the residual network to focus on the distinctive channels and spaces of images respectively. The location information enhances the corresponding features of related features and suppresses the influence of irrelevant features.The results show that the F1-score is 99.63%, the accuracy is 99.61%. Our model provides a high-performance solution for accurate classification of AD.</p>

	<p>Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of risk factors in predicting the variation in carotid atherosclerosis at ultrasonographic follow-up and, therefore, its role in the progression of large-vessel disease. Methods: This retrospective population study included all the outpatients that underwent at least two carotid ultrasonographies at our laboratory from 2001 to 2017. Demographic data, vascular risk factors, and the results at follow-up were analysed to determine if correlations exist between these risk factors and variation in carotid atherosclerosis. Results: Data from 600 patients (327 males and 273 females with a mean age of 67 years) were collected. The mean follow-up period was 49 months (range: 1&amp;amp;ndash;195). We analysed each demographic variable and risk factor to assess its correlation with a worsening of carotid atherosclerosis; previous myocardial infarction (2.594), previous carotid surgical treatment (2.368), and hypertension (1.85) were found to have the highest odds ratios, respectively. Furthermore, the sample was divided into specific subpopulations (diabetes, hypertension, and smoking), and an association was found between age and worsening stenosis. Discussion and conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of carotid ultrasonographic follow-up in the monitoring and managing of large-vessel disease. Myocardial infarction, previous stroke, and previous surgical treatment were the strongest predictors of a worsening of carotid atherosclerosis. These findings suggest a strict follow-up is needed, even in the absence of significant carotid atherosclerosis at baseline.</p>

     alt="Cortical synapses of the world's smallest mammal: An FIB/SEM study in the Etruscan shrew"/><p>The present work provides a quantitative dataset of synapses from the Etruscan shrew (the smallest known terrestrial mammal). We have identified common and differing principles of synaptic organization compared to other mammalian species.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The main aim of the present study was to determine if synapses from the exceptionally small brain of the Etruscan shrew show any peculiarities compared to the much larger human brain. We analyzed the cortical synaptic density and a variety of structural characteristics of 7,239 3D reconstructed synapses, using using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM). We found that some of the general synaptic characteristics are remarkably similar to those found in the human cerebral cortex. However, the cortical volume of the human brain is about 50,000 times larger than the cortical volume of the Etruscan shrew, while the total number of cortical synapses in human is only 20,000 times the number of synapses in the shrew, and synaptic junctions are 35% smaller in the Etruscan shrew. Thus, the differences in the number and size of synapses cannot be attributed to a brain size scaling effect but rather to adaptations of synaptic circuits to particular functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chatbot to predict need of a stent in cardiac treatment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Every year, across the globe about 1,800,000 people suffers with heart attack and India has the highest rate in the world with almost 25% families having a member who suffered heart attack at least once. One of the solutions to reduce the heart attacks in patients is placing a stent. Once the blockage is identified, it is suggested that a stent with the required size is inserted into the coronary artery. The invasive device and its associated cost automatically leads to a dilemma for both the doctors as well as patients. The young practitioners of cardiology may face a dilemma sometimes whether to go for stent or not. The patients undergoing treatment for cardiac issues would be in a two state mind whether to go for stent or not. The above two dilemmas can be mitigated and confidence of both doctors and patients in decision making can be enhanced with the help of a technology driven application that suggests requirement of stent with a degree of confidence.  Methods: The chatbot in our project shall help in taking textual and image based inputs of the information of the heart and coronary artery of a patient and predicts the requirement of stent being placed. The real time data of 50 patients was used in training the model with a data set consisting of 349 scanned images of angiogram. The model developed consists of sequential CNN model with 5 convolutional 2D layers and 5 Maxpool layers.  Results: The model could achieve an accuracy of 81%. Conclusions: The authors have successfully developed and tested a machine learning based chatbot model to predict the need of a stent in cardiac treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study among final year medical students at the University of Zambia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Since the globe was faced with the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, numerous adjustments have been made in all sectors to curtail the spread of infection. Most elementary and tertiary schools were closed or suspended until the transmission rates dropped. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, medical schools in Zambia have sought ways to replace face-to-face medical learning with virtual clinical teaching. The objectives of this study were to explore the perceptions of online learning among University of Zambia medical students and understand the barriers and facilitators to effective online learning. Methods A qualitative descriptive approach was used, enrolling final year medical students from the University of Zambia; the consenting participants were sampled purposively and interviewed through virtual platforms until data saturation was reached upon interviewing the 11th participant. A total of 14 participants were interviewed, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and data was analyzed using six steps of thematic analysis. Results Three broad themes arose from the interviews: online learning perceptions, facilitators and barriers to online learning. Regarding perceptions of online learning, they highlighted that the delivery was simple to understand, with convenient scheduling and the benefit of being able to refer back to the recorded lectures. Some barriers encountered during the online learning were poor network connection, frequent power outages, lack of patient-student interaction and challenges with learning space in their homes. The facilitators were self-paced learning, availability of lecturers and the desire to complete their training despite the lockdown being in effect. Conclusions Most medical students had positive perceptions of online learning despite its challenges. With the improvement in technology, online education should be incorporated into the traditional training of medical students to get the best outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">IL1B gene variants, but not TNF, CXCL8, IL6 and IL10, modify the course of cystic fibrosis in Polish patients. [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether selected polymorphic variants in genes from the inflammatory pathway can be predictors of pulmonary or digestive manifestation of cystic fibrosis, as well as of severity of lung disease. Materials and methods: Using pyrosequencing and sequencing we have genotyped 12 variants in TNF (rs361525, rs1800629), CXCL8 (rs4073, rs2227306, rs2227307, rs188378669), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143634, rs1142639, rs1143627), IL6 (rs1800795) and IL10 (rs1800896) genes in a cohort of 55 Polish patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis and controls. In our study group, a pulmonary manifestation of disease revealed 44 of subjects (80%), and digestive symptoms dominated in 11 (20%) of analyzed individuals. Severe lung dysfunction has occurred in 20 (36.4%) of patients. Results: We proved, that two promoter variants of IL1B, rs1143627 (c.-118G > A) and rs16944 (c.-598T > C) are presented significantly more often  in patients with severe character of lung disease compared to mild (82.5% vs. 62.8%, p-value 0.030, and 87.5% vs. 64.3%, p-value 0.008, respectively) in cystic fibrosis course. Haplotype AC formed by both changes had also a higher frequency (80%) in patients with severe course compared to the mild character (61.4%) of disease. However, the frequency of promoter variant TNF c.-308C > T (rs1800629) was presented at a significantly lower level in the patient’s group compared to healthy controls (2.7% vs. 15%, p-value 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlated with the lower FEV1% in patients (p-value 0.01). Conclusions: Genetic variants, rs1143627 and rs16944, of IL1B are promising candidates as predictors of the severe character of lung disease in Polish patients with cystic fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that has rapidly spread across the world with a detrimental effect on the global population. Several reports have highlighted an increased mortality rate and a higher severity of COVID-19 infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals. Upon the development of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, mRNA vaccines including BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were deemed safe, with a high efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in the general population. This review investigates whether  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are as effective in triggering an immune response in Dialysis Patients (DPs) and Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs) and if a third dose is required in this  population. Methods: A systematic search employing the PRISMA criteria was conducted in several major databases, with the data being extracted from publications for the period January 2021 to May 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022338514, June 15, 2022). Results: 80 studies were included in this analysis with a total cohort number of 15,059 participants. Overall, 85.29% (OR = 17.08, 95% CI = 15.84-18.42, I2 = 98%) and 41.06% (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.48-0.5, I2 = 95%) of DPs and KTRs included in this review showed positive seroconversion after two doses of either mRNA vaccine, respectively. A total 76% (OR = 6.53, 95% CI = 5.63-7.5, I2 = 96%) of the cohort given a third dose of an mRNA vaccine demonstrated positive seroconversion, with 61.86% (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.95-2.75 I2 = 95%) of the cohort that was assessed for a cellular response displaying a positive response. Conclusions: This data emphasises a reduced incidence of a positive immune response in DPs and KTRs compared to healthy controls, albeit a better response in DPs than when compared to KTRs alone was observed. A third dose  appears to increase the occurrence of an immune response in the overall DP/KTR cohort.

                Background: Accounting practices, profit bubbles, information manipulation and deception, and earning management are all examples of fraudulent financial statement cases. Companies create fraudulent financial statements for a variety of reasons, including financial challenges and debt payment delays. Financial fraud is created by five factors: pressure, opportunity, rationalization, capability, and arrogance. Methods: The purpose of this study is to see whether audit quality (AQ) has a moderating effect on the relationship between financial distress (FD) and earning management (EM) to financial statement fraud (FSF) in infrastructure, utility, and transportation companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the years 2015 to 2019. The data sources are the www.idx.go.id and the company’s annual reports. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from thirty companies over the course of five years, totaling 150 observations. Moderating regression analysis (MRA) was used in data analysis. Result and conclusions: The hypothesis testing revealed that FD and EM have a significant impact on FSF.  AQ is able to moderate the relationship between FD to FSF but unable to moderate the relationship between EM to FSF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Reversal and subsequent return of optic disc cupping in a myocilin (MYOC) gene-associated severe Juvenile Open-Angle Glaucoma (JOAG) patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                To our knowledge, this case report describes the first instance of reversal of glaucomatous optic nerve cupping in a young adult with a rare form of juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) associated with a novel variant of the myocilin gene (MYOC). This 25-year-old woman with severe-stage MYOC-associated JOAG presented with blurry vision and intermittent pain in her left eye. She had a strong family history of glaucoma in multiple first-degree relatives with an identified novel variant of MYOC. Examination revealed intraocular pressures (IOPs) of 10 mmHg OD and 46 mmHg OS, with cup-to-disc ratios of 0.90 and 0.80. The patient experienced substantial reversal of optic disc cupping OS following dramatic IOP reduction with trabeculectomy, and subsequently experienced a return of cupping after an IOP spike 15 months postoperatively. The reversal of cupping did not correspond to any changes in the patient’s visual field. After an initial decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, RNFL remained stable for over 2 years after trabeculectomy as seen on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). This case suggests reversal of cupping can occur well into adulthood in a MYOC-associated JOAG patient, and it demonstrates the potential bidirectionality of this phenomenon. Moreover, it suggests that these structural changes may not correspond to any functional changes in visual fields or RNFL thickness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Exploring the mono-/bistability range of positively autoregulated signaling systems in the presence of competing transcription factor binding sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rong Gao, Samantha E. Brokaw, Zeyue Li, Libby J. Helfant, Ti Wu, Muhammad Malik, Ann M. Stock</p>

Binding of transcription factor (TF) proteins to regulatory DNA sites is key to accurate control of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Theoretical modeling of transcription regulation is often focused on a limited set of genes of interest, while binding of the TF to other genomic sites is seldom considered. The total number of TF binding sites (TFBSs) affects the availability of TF protein molecules and sequestration of a TF by TFBSs can promote bistability. For many signaling systems where a graded response is desirable for continuous control over the input range, biochemical parameters of the regulatory proteins need be tuned to avoid bistability. Here we analyze the mono-/bistable parameter range for positively autoregulated two-component systems (TCSs) in the presence of different numbers of competing TFBSs. TCS signaling, one of the major bacterial signaling strategies, couples signal perception with output responses via protein phosphorylation. For bistability, competition for TF proteins by TFBSs lowers the requirement for high fold change of the autoregulated transcription but demands high phosphorylation activities of TCS proteins. We show that bistability can be avoided with a low phosphorylation capacity of TCSs, a high TF affinity for the autoregulated promoter or a low fold change in signaling protein levels upon induction. These may represent general design rules for TCSs to ensure uniform graded responses. Examining the mono-/bistability parameter range allows qualitative prediction of steady-state responses, which are experimentally validated in the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> CusRS system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Look twice: A generalist computational model predicts return fixations across tasks and species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengmi Zhang, Marcelo Armendariz, Will Xiao, Olivia Rose, Katarina Bendtz, Margaret Livingstone, Carlos Ponce, Gabriel Kreiman</p>

Primates constantly explore their surroundings via saccadic eye movements that bring different parts of an image into high resolution. In addition to exploring new regions in the visual field, primates also make frequent return fixations, revisiting previously foveated locations. We systematically studied a total of 44,328 return fixations out of 217,440 fixations. Return fixations were ubiquitous across different behavioral tasks, in monkeys and humans, both when subjects viewed static images and when subjects performed natural behaviors. Return fixations locations were consistent across subjects, tended to occur within short temporal offsets, and typically followed a 180-degree turn in saccadic direction. To understand the origin of return fixations, we propose a proof-of-principle, biologically-inspired and image-computable neural network model. The model combines five key modules: an image feature extractor, bottom-up saliency cues, task-relevant visual features, finite inhibition-of-return, and saccade size constraints. Even though there are no free parameters that are fine-tuned for each specific task, species, or condition, the model produces fixation sequences resembling the universal properties of return fixations. These results provide initial steps towards a mechanistic understanding of the trade-off between rapid foveal recognition and the need to scrutinize previous fixation locations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Effective resistance against pandemics: Mobility network sparsification for high-fidelity epidemic simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Mercier, Samuel Scarpino, Cristopher Moore</p>

Network science has increasingly become central to the field of epidemiology and our ability to respond to infectious disease threats. However, many networks derived from modern datasets are not just large, but dense, with a high ratio of edges to nodes. This includes human mobility networks where most locations have a large number of links to many other locations. Simulating large-scale epidemics requires substantial computational resources and in many cases is practically infeasible. One way to reduce the computational cost of simulating epidemics on these networks is <i>sparsification</i>, where a representative subset of edges is selected based on some measure of their importance. We test several sparsification strategies, ranging from naive thresholding to random sampling of edges, on mobility data from the U.S. Following recent work in computer science, we find that the most accurate approach uses the <i>effective resistances</i> of edges, which prioritizes edges that are the only efficient way to travel between their endpoints. The resulting sparse network preserves many aspects of the behavior of an SIR model, including both global quantities, like the epidemic size, and local details of stochastic events, including the probability each node becomes infected and its distribution of arrival times. This holds even when the sparse network preserves fewer than 10% of the edges of the original network. In addition to its practical utility, this method helps illuminate which links of a weighted, undirected network are most important to disease spread.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpreting and de-noising genetically engineered barcodes in a DNA virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sylvain Blois, Benjamin M. Goetz, James J. Bull, Christopher S. Sullivan</p>

The concept of a nucleic acid barcode applied to pathogen genomes is easy to grasp and the many possible uses are straightforward. But implementation may not be easy, especially when growing through multiple generations or assaying the pathogen long-term. The potential problems include: the barcode might alter fitness, the barcode may accumulate mutations, and construction of the marked pathogens may result in unintended barcodes that are not as designed. Here, we generate approximately 5000 randomized barcodes in the genome of the prototypic small DNA virus murine polyomavirus. We describe the challenges faced with interpreting the barcode sequences obtained from the library. Our Illumina NextSeq sequencing recalled much greater variation in barcode sequencing reads than the expected 5000 barcodes–necessarily stemming from the Illumina library processing and sequencing error. Using data from defined control virus genomes cloned into plasmid backbones we develop a vetted post-sequencing method to cluster the erroneous reads around the true virus genome barcodes. These findings may foreshadow problems with randomized barcodes in other microbial systems and provide a useful approach for future work utilizing nucleic acid barcoded pathogens.

     alt="Thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of multiple functional domains in posterior parietal cortex of galagos"/>
<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos contains a series of domains where electrical stimulation evokes different types of complex movements. The medial domains have more connections with the motor thalamus, whereas the lateral domains connect more densely with the posterior thalamus that involves in somatosensory processing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In prosimian galagos, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into a number of functional domains where long-train intracortical microstimulation evoked different types of complex movements. Here, we placed anatomical tracers in multiple locations of PPC to reveal the origins and targets of thalamic connections of four PPC domains for different types of hindlimb, forelimb, or face movements. Thalamic connections of all four domains included nuclei of the motor thalamus, ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, as well as parts of the sensory thalamus, the anterior pulvinar, posterior and ventral posterior superior nuclei, consistent with the sensorimotor functions of PPC domains. PPC domains also projected to the thalamic reticular nucleus in a somatotopic pattern. Quantitative differences in the distributions of labeled neurons in thalamic nuclei suggested that connectional patterns of these domains differed from each other.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<i>PmCRH</i>) and the CRH-binding protein (<i>PmCRHBP</i>) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae, and adults of the sea lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with antityrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization, or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. <i>PmCRH</i> expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing toward the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord mainly come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. <i>PmCRH</i>- and <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lungfish are the fish related most closely to tetrapods. The olfactory organ of lungfish contains two distinct sensory epithelia: the lamellar olfactory epithelium (OE) and the recess epithelium (RecE). Based on their ultrastructural and histological characteristics, the lamellar OE and the RecE are considered to correspond respectively to the teleost OE and a primitive vomeronasal organ (VNO). In tetrapods, the OE and VNO have been shown to express different families of olfactory receptors; for example, in mammals, the OE expresses odorant receptors and trace amine-associated receptors, while the VNO expresses type 1 (V1Rs) and type 2 (V2Rs) vomeronasal receptors. In the present study, we examined the expression of V1Rs in the olfactory organs of two African lungfish, <i>Protopterus annectens</i> and <i>Protopterus amphibius</i>. RNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses identified 29 V1R genes in <i>P. annectens</i> and 50 V1R genes in <i>P. amphibius</i>. Most V1Rs identified in these lungfish were classified as the tetrapod-type V1Rs initially found in tetrapods and distinct from fish-type V1Rs. In teleost, which all lack a VNO, all olfactory receptors are expressed in the OE, while in <i>Xenopus</i> V1Rs are expressed exclusively in the OE, and not in the VNO. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that lungfish V1Rs were expressed mainly in the lamellar OE and rarely in the RecE. These results imply that V1R expression in lungfish represents an intermediate step toward the complete segregation of V1R expression between the OE and VNO, reflecting the phylogenetic position of lungfish between teleosts and amphibians.</p>

     alt="Subclass-specific expression patterns of MET receptor tyrosine kinase during development in medial prefrontal and visual cortices"/>
<p>Percentage of MET-expressing neurons in medial prefrontal and primary visual (V1) cortices varies between layer and age in mice. The predominant subclass of MET<sup>+</sup> projection neurons in mPFC is subcortical, including corticothalamic, whereas it is intratelencephalic in V1, demonstrating stark heterogeneity between cortical regions. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Met</i> encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) that is expressed during development and regulates cortical synapse maturation. Conditional deletion of <i>Met</i> in the nervous system during embryonic development leads to deficits in adult contextual fear learning, a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent cognitive task. MET also regulates the timing of critical period plasticity for ocular dominance in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the underlying circuitry responsible remains unknown. Therefore, this study determines the broad expression patterns of MET throughout postnatal development in mPFC and V1 projection neurons (PNs), providing insight into similarities and differences in the neuronal subtypes and temporal patterns of MET expression between cortical areas. Using a transgenic mouse line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in <i>Met<sup>+</sup>
</i> neurons, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize MET-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell bodies and PN subclass-specific protein markers. Analyses reveal that the MET expression is highly enriched in infragranular layers of mPFC, but in supragranular layers of V1. Interestingly, temporal regulation of the percentage of MET<sup>+</sup> neurons across development not only differs between cortical regions but also is distinct between lamina within a cortical region. Further, MET is expressed predominantly in the subcerebral PN subclass in mPFC, but the intratelencephalic PN subclass in V1. The data suggest that MET signaling influences the development of distinct circuits in mPFC and V1 that underlie subcerebral and intracortical functional deficits following <i>Met</i> deletion, respectively.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The melanocortin system is a key regulator of appetite and food intake in vertebrates. This system includes the neuropeptides neuropeptide y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). An important center for appetite control in mammals is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, with neurons that coexpress either the orexigenic NPY/AGRP or the anorexigenic CART/POMC neuropeptides. In ray-finned fishes, such a center is less characterized. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) has multiple genes of these neuropeptides due to whole-genome duplication events. To better understand the potential involvement of the melanocortin system in appetite and food intake control, we have mapped the mRNA expression of <i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> in the brain of Atlantic salmon parr using in situ hybridization. After identifying hypothalamic mRNA expression, we investigated the possible intracellular coexpression of <i>npy/agrp</i> and <i>cart/pomc</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The results showed that the neuropeptides were widely distributed, especially in sensory and neuroendocrine brain regions. In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>. This is the first demonstration of coexpression of <i>cart2b/pomca</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus of a teleost. Collectively, our data suggest that the lateral tuberal nucleus is the center for appetite control in salmon, similar to that of mammals. Extrahypothalamic brain regions might also be involved in regulating food intake, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain.</p>

     alt="In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development"/><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to generate a KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence reporter zebrafish line and characterized KCC2b regional distribution and dynamics in vivo during early brain development. We demonstrate KCC2b expression in postmigration stage neurons and suppression of KCC2b expression by exposure to bisphenol-A. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing this protein's complex dynamics during brain development and screening compounds aimed at modulating chloride homeostasis through KCC2b.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuronal chloride (Cl−) exporter, KCC2, regulates neuron excitability and development and undergoes a stereotypical pattern of delayed upregulation as neurons mature. KCC2 upregulation favors neural inhibition by establishing a negative Cl− gradient, ensuring GABA-induced Cl− currents are inward and inhibitory. We developed a zebrafish fluorescent reporter line, KCC2b:mCitrine, to track KCC2 expression in vivo during early brain development. KCC2b:mCitrine was first detected at 16 h postfertilization and by day 6 labeled most central and peripheral neurons and processes. At 20 h, expression was greatest in the soma-dense basal neuroepithelium but largely absent in apical and mantle zones where differentiation and migration primarily occur, and time lapse imaging at this stage supports a postmigration upregulation of KCC2b. Central dopamine neurons showed low KCC2b expression as observed in other species. KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence was stable over minutes in most neurons, but brightness transients observed in single cells fit our expectation for real-time tracking of KCC2b upregulation in new neurons. To further assess whether fluorescence brightness tracks KCC2b expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), which is known to suppress KCC2 expression. Fluorescence decreased after 6 days of BPA exposure but not after 2 or 4 days, suggesting that it is an accurate but delayed indicator of KCC2b expression. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing KCC2b's complex dynamics during brain development, and potentially screening compounds aimed at modulating KCC2 expression.</p>

     alt="Convergence of bilateral auditory midbrain inputs on neurons in the auditory thalamus of chicken"/><p>In chicken, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis projects to bilateral nucleus ovoidalis (Ov), and ipsilateral projection is stronger than the contralateral one. A subpopulation of Ov neurons receive input from both sides of Ov. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the avian ascending auditory pathway, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd; the auditory midbrain center) receives inputs from virtually all lower brainstem auditory nuclei and sends outputs bilaterally to the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov; the auditory thalamic nucleus). Axons from part of the MLd terminate in a particular domain of Ov, thereby suggesting a formation of segregated pathways point-to-point from lower brainstem nuclei via MLd to the thalamus. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether any spatial clustering of thalamic neurons that receive inputs from specific domains of MLd exists. Ov neurons receive input from bilateral MLds; however, the degree of laterality has not been reported yet. In this study, we injected a recombinant avian adeno-associated virus, a transsynaptic anterograde vector into the MLd of the chick, and analyzed the distribution of labeled postsynaptic neurons on both sides of the Ov. We found that fluorescent protein-labeled neurons on both sides of the Ov were clustered in domains corresponding to subregions of the MLd. The laterality of projections was calculated as the ratio of neurons labeled by comparing ipsilateral to contralateral projections from the MLd, and it was 1.86 on average, thereby indicating a slight ipsilateral projection dominance. Bilateral inputs from different subdomains of the MLd converged on several single Ov neurons, thereby implying a possibility of a de novo binaural processing of the auditory information in the Ov.</p>

     alt="Adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive direct somatosensory inputs from ipsi- and contralateral primary afferents and from brainstem motor nuclei"/>
<p>Monosynaptic tracing analysis demonstrates the direct connectivity of Dmrt3 neurons to proprioceptors and brain centers involved in motor control, suggesting a sensorimotor integrative role for Dmrt3 interneurons in a neuronal path for motion and locomotion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the spinal cord, sensory-motor circuits controlling motor activity are situated in the dorso–ventral interface. The neurons identified by the expression of the transcription factor Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (Dmrt3) have previously been associated with the coordination of locomotion in horses (<i>Equus caballus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), and zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, F. Hamilton, 1822). Based on earlier studies, we hypothesized that, in mice, these neurons may be positioned to receive sensory and central inputs to relay processed commands to motor neurons. Thus, we investigated the presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons using monosynaptic retrograde replication-deficient rabies tracing. The analysis showed that lumbar Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from intrasegmental neurons, and intersegmental neurons from the cervical, thoracic, and sacral segments. Some of these neurons belong to the excitatory V2a interneurons and to plausible Renshaw cells, defined by the expression of Chx10 and calbindin, respectively. We also found that proprioceptive primary sensory neurons of type Ia2, Ia3, and Ib, defined by the expression of calbindin, calretinin, and Brn3c, respectively, provide presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons. In addition, we demonstrated that Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from brain areas involved in motor regulation, including the red nucleus, primary sensory–motor cortex, and pontine nuclei. In conclusion, adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from motor-related brain areas as well as proprioceptive primary sensory neurons and have been shown to connect directly to motor neurons. Dmrt3 neurons are thus positioned to provide sensory–motor control and their connectivity is suggestive of the classical reflex pathways present in the spinal cord.</p>

This study provides the first description of FMRP distribution pattern in the developing and mature auditory inner ear of rodents and birds.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein that is essential for neural circuit assembly and synaptic plasticity. Loss of functional FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory dysfunction including abnormal auditory processing. While the central mechanisms of FMRP regulation have been studied in the brain, whether FMRP is expressed in the auditory periphery and how it develops and functions remains unknown. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of FMRP immunoreactivity in the inner ear of mice, rats, gerbils, and chickens. Across species, FMRP was expressed in hair cells and supporting cells, with a particularly high level in immature hair cells during the prehearing period. Interestingly, the distribution of cytoplasmic FMRP displayed an age-dependent translocation in hair cells, and this feature was conserved across species. In the auditory ganglion (AG), FMRP immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal cell bodies as well as their peripheral and central processes. Distinct from hair cells, FMRP intensity in AG neurons was high both during development and after maturation. Additionally, FMRP was evident in mature glial cells surrounding AG neurons. Together, these observations demonstrate distinct developmental trajectories across cell types in the auditory periphery. Given the importance of peripheral inputs to the maturation of auditory circuits, these findings implicate involvement of FMRP in inner ear development as well as a potential contribution of periphery FMRP to the generation of auditory dysfunction in FXS.</p>

Therefore, we conducted in-depth neuropathological examinations of resective specimens from corresponding patients to provide insights as to the underlying disease processes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study, cases with significant cognitive deterioration following a previous postoperative assessment were extracted from the neuropsychological database of a longstanding epilepsy surgical programme. An extensive re-analysis of available specimens was performed using current, state-of-the-art neuropathological examinations. Patients without cognitive deterioration but matched in regard to basic pathologies served as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 355 operated patients who had undergone more than one postoperative neuropsychological examination, 30 (8%) showed significant cognitive decline in the period after surgery. Of the 24 patients with available specimens, 71% displayed further neuropathological changes in addition to the typical spectrum (i.e. hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasias, vascular lesions and low-grade tumours) indicating (a) a secondary, putatively epilepsy-independent neurodegenerative disease process; (b) limbic inflammation; or (c) the enigmatic pathology pattern of ‘hippocampal gliosis’ without segmental neurodegeneration. In the controls the matched individual principal epilepsy-associated pathologies were not found in combination with the secondary pathology patterns of the study group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that patients who unexpectedly displayed an unfavourable cognitive development beyond any direct surgical effects show rare and very particular pathogenetic causes or parallel, presumably independent, neurodegenerative alterations. A multicentre collection of such cases would be appreciated in order to discern presurgical biomarkers which help with surgical decision making.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Probing top-down information in neocortical layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Accurate perception of the environment is a constructive process that requires integration of external bottom-up sensory signals with internally generated top-down information. Decades of work have elucidated how sensory neocortex processes physical stimulus features. By contrast, examining how top-down information is encoded and integrated with bottom-up signals has been challenging using traditional neuroscience methods. Recent technological advances in functional imaging of brain-wide afferents in behaving mice have enabled the direct measurement of top-down information.

                The heterogeneity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) makes it a versatile platform for a broad range of homeostatic processes, ranging from calcium regulation to synthesis and trafficking of proteins and lipids. It is not surprising that neurons use this organelle to fine-tune synaptic properties and thereby provide specificity to synaptic inputs. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that enable activity-dependent ER recruitment into dendritic spines, with a focus on molecular mechanisms that mediate transport and retention of the ER in spines.

                Neuroscience has a long history of investigating the neural correlates of brain functions. One example is fear, which has been studied intensely in a variety of species. In parallel, unease about definitions of brain functions has existed for over 100 years. Because the translational impact of basic research hinges on how we define these functions, these definitions should be carefully considered.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Continuously changing memories: a framework for proactive and non-linear consolidation</a></h4>

              
                The traditional view of long-term memory is that memory traces mature in a predetermined 'linear' process: their neural substrate shifts from rapidly plastic medial temporal regions towards stable neocortical networks. We propose that memories remain malleable, not by repeated reinstantiations of this linear process but instead via dynamic routes of proactive and non-linear consolidation: memories change, their trajectory is flexible and reversible, and their physical basis develops continuously according to anticipated demands.

                Zemla et al. demonstrate that mice develop different neuronal spatial representations depending on task rules. With learning, place maps become more different. Initially unstable maps stabilize with experience during memory recall. These findings identify the importance of behavior and task demands on stability of neuronal activity patterns supporting long-term memory.

Conditional genetics and bone morphology analyses indicate En1 or Lmx1b do not alter regenerated digit DV patterning, refuting the hypothesis that embryonic limb patterning pathways are re-used during regeneration.

                The establishment of a functional vasculature requires the quiescence entry of endothelial cells (ECs) when development is completed, otherwise, pathological overgrowth occurs. In this study, Yu et al. identify Zeb1, which acts upstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, to govern the quiescence of EC progenitors and the transition into homeostasis.

                Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a main pathogenicity factor of α<i>-</i> and β<i>-</i>coronaviruses. Nsp1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suppresses the host gene expression by sterically blocking 40S host ribosomal subunits and promoting host mRNA degradation. This mechanism leads to the downregulation of the translation-mediated innate immune response in host cells, ultimately mediating the observed immune evasion capabilities of SARS-CoV-2. Here, by combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations, fragment screening and crystallography, we reveal druggable pockets in Nsp1. Structural and computational solvent mapping analyses indicate the partial crypticity of these newly discovered and druggable binding sites. The results of fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography confirm the druggability of the major pocket of Nsp1. Finally, we show how the targeting of this pocket could disrupt the Nsp1-mRNA complex and open a novel avenue to design new inhibitors for other Nsp1s present in homologous β<i>-</i>coronaviruses.

                We describe a subset of glioblastoma, the most prevalent malignant adult brain tumour, harbouring a bias towards hypomethylation at defined differentially methylated regions. This epigenetic signature correlates with an enrichment for an astrocytic gene signature, which together with the identification of enriched predicted binding sites of transcription factors known to cause demethylation and to be involved in astrocytic/glial lineage specification, point to a shared ontogeny between these glioblastomas and astroglial progenitors. At functional level, increased invasiveness, at least in part mediated by SRPX2, and macrophage infiltration characterise this subset of glioblastoma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bundling and segregation affect pheromone deposition, but not choice, in an ant</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural economists have identified many psychological manipulations which affect perceived value. A prominent example of this is bundling, in which several small gains (or costs) are experienced as more valuable (or costly) than if the same total amount is presented together. While extensively demonstrated in humans, to our knowledge this effect has never been investigated in an animal, let alone an invertebrate. We trained individual <i>Lasius niger</i> workers to two of three conditions in which either costs (travel distance), gains (sucrose reward), or both were either bundled or segregated: (1) both costs and gains bundled, (2) both segregated, and (3) only gains segregated. We recorded pheromone deposition on the ants’ return trips to the nest as measure of perceived value. After training, we offer the ants a binary choice between odours associated with the treatments. While bundling treatment did not affect binary choice, it strongly influenced pheromone deposition. Ants deposited c. 80% more pheromone when rewards were segregated but costs bundled as compared with both costs and rewards being bundled. This pattern is further complicated by the pairwise experience each animal made, and which of the treatments it experiences first during training. This demonstrates that even insects are influenced by bundling effects. We propose that the deviation between binary choice and pheromone deposition in this case may be due to a possible linearity in distance perception in ants, while almost all other sensory perception in animals is logarithmic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of human phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the resting state</a></h4>

              
                Phagocyte oxidase plays an essential role in the first line of host defense against pathogens. It oxidizes intracellular NADPH to reduce extracellular oxygen to produce superoxide anions that participate in pathogen killing. The resting phagocyte oxidase is a heterodimeric complex formed by two transmembrane proteins NOX2 and p22. Despite the physiological importance of this complex, its structure remains elusive. Here we reported the cryo-EM structure of the functional human NOX2-p22 complex in nanodisc in the resting state. NOX2 shows a canonical 6-TM architecture of NOX and p22 has four transmembrane helices. M3, M4, and M5 of NOX2 and M1 and M4 helices of p22 are involved in the hetero-dimer formation. DH domain of NOX2 in the resting state is not optimally docked onto the transmembrane domain (TMD), leading to inefficient electron transfer and NADPH binding. Structural analysis suggests that the cytosolic factors might activate the NOX2-p22 complex by stabilizing the dehydrogenase domain (DH) in a productive docked conformation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The genetic risk of gestational diabetes in South Asian women</a></h4>

              
                South Asian women are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes (GDM). Few studies have investigated the genetic contributions to GDM risk. We investigated the association of a type 2 diabetes (T2D) polygenic risk score (PRS), on its own, and with GDM risk factors, on GDM-related traits using data from two birth cohorts in which South Asian women were enrolled during pregnancy. 837 and 4,372 pregnant South Asian women from the SouTh Asian BiRth CohorT (START) and Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort studies underwent a 75-gram glucose tolerance test. PRSs were derived using GWAS results from an independent multi-ethnic study (~18% South Asians). Associations with fasting plasma glucose (FPG); 2h post-load glucose (2hG); area under the curve glucose; and GDM were tested using linear and logistic regressions. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of the PRS was calculated. Every 1 SD increase in the PRS was associated with a 0.085 mmol/L increase in FPG ([95%CI=0.07-0.10], P=2.85 × 10<sup>-20</sup>); 0.21 mmol/L increase in 2hG ([95%CI=0.16-0.26], P=5.49 × 10<sup>-16</sup>); and a 45% increase in the risk of GDM ([95%CI=32-60%], P=2.27 × 10<sup>-14</sup>), independent of parental history of diabetes and other GDM risk factors. PRS tertile 3 accounted for 12.5% of the population's GDM alone, and 21.7% when combined with family history. A few weak PRS and GDM risk factors interactions modulating FPG and GDM were observed. Together, these results show that a T2D PRS and family history of diabetes are strongly and independently associated with multiple GDM-related traits in women of South Asian descent, an effect that could be modulated by other environmental factors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular basis for the role of disulfide-linked αCTs in the activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and insulin receptor</a></h4>

              
                The insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) control metabolic homeostasis and cell growth and proliferation. The IR and IGF1R form similar disulfide bonds linked homodimers in the apo-state; however, their ligand binding properties and the structures in the active state differ substantially. It has been proposed that the disulfide-linked C-terminal segment of α-chain (αCTs) of the IR and IGF1R control the cooperativity of ligand binding and regulate the receptor activation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the roles of disulfide-linked αCTs in IR and IGF1R activation are still unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of full-length mouse IGF1R/IGF1 and IR/insulin complexes with modified αCTs that have increased flexibility. Unlike the Γ-shaped asymmetric IGF1R dimer with a single IGF1 bound, the IGF1R with the enhanced flexibility of αCTs can form a T-shaped symmetric dimer with two IGF1s bound. Meanwhile, the IR with non-covalently linked αCTs predominantly adopts an asymmetric conformation with four insulins bound, which is distinct from the T-shaped symmetric IR. Using cell-based experiments, we further showed that both IGF1R and IR with the modified αCTs cannot activate the downstream signaling potently. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the certain structural rigidity of disulfide-linked αCTs is critical for optimal IR and IGF1R signaling activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Whole brain correlates of individual differences in skin conductance responses during discriminative fear conditioning to social cues</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis for individual differences in the skin conductance response (SCR) during discriminative fear conditioning may inform on our understanding of autonomic regulation in fear-related psychopathology. Previous region-of-interest (ROI) analyses have implicated the amygdala in regulating conditioned SCR, but whole brain analyses are lacking. This study examined correlations between individual differences in SCR during discriminative fear conditioning to social stimuli and neural activity throughout the brain, by using data from a large functional magnetic resonance imaging study of twins (<i>N</i> = 285 individuals). Results show that conditioned SCR correlates with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior midcingulate cortex, anterior insula, bilateral temporoparietal junction, right frontal operculum, bilateral dorsal premotor cortex, right superior parietal lobe, and midbrain. A ROI analysis additionally showed a positive correlation between amygdala activity and conditioned SCR in line with previous reports. We suggest that the observed whole brain correlates of SCR belong to a large-scale midcingulo-insular network related to salience detection and autonomic-interoceptive processing. Altered activity within this network may underlie individual differences in conditioned SCR and autonomic aspects of psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of perceptual reorganisation from prior knowledge in human development and Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                The use of prior knowledge to guide perception is fundamental to human vision, especially under challenging viewing circumstances. Underpinning current theories of predictive coding, prior knowledge delivered to early sensory areas via cortical feedback connections can reshape perception of ambiguous stimuli, such as 'two-tone' images. Despite extensive interest and ongoing research into this process of perceptual reorganisation in the adult brain, it is not yet fully understood how or when the efficient use of prior knowledge for visual perception develops. Here we show for the first time that adult-like levels of perceptual reorganisation do not emerge until late childhood. We used a behavioural two-tone paradigm to isolate the effects of prior knowledge on visual perception in children aged 4 - 12 years and adults, and found a clear developmental progression in the perceptual benefit gained from informative cues. Whilst photo cueing reliably triggered perceptual reorganisation of two-tones for adults, 4- to 9-year-olds' performed significantly poorer immediately after cueing than within-subject benchmarks of recognition. Young childens' behaviour revealed perceptual biases towards local image features, as has been seen in image classification neural networks. We tested three such models (AlexNet, CorNet and NASNet) on two-tone classification, and while we found that network depth and recurrence may improve recognition, the best-performing network behaved similarly to young children. Our results reveal a prolonged development of prior-knowledge-guided vision throughout childhood, a process which may be central to other perceptual abilities that continue developing throughout childhood. This highlights the importance of effective reconciliation of signal and prediction for robust perception in both human and computational vision systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing brain kynurenic acid synthesis precludes kynurenine-induced sleep disturbances</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives Patients with neurocognitive disorders often battle sleep disturbances. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a tryptophan metabolite implicated in the pathology of these illnesses. Modest increases in KYNA, an antagonist at glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors, result in cognitive impairments and sleep dysfunction. We explored the hypothesis that inhibition of the KYNA synthesizing enzyme, kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), may alleviate sleep disturbances. Methods At the start of the light phase, adult male and female Wistar rats received systemic injections of either i) vehicle, ii) kynurenine (100mg/kg; i.p.), iii) the KAT II inhibitor, PF-04859989 (30 mg/kg; s.c), or iv) PF-04859989 and kynurenine in combination. Kynurenine and KYNA levels were evaluated in the plasma and brain. Separate animals were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) telemetry devices to record polysomnography and evaluate vigilance states wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep following each treatment. Results Kynurenine challenge increased brain KYNA and resulted in reduced REM duration, NREM delta power and sleep spindles. PF-04859989 reduced brain KYNA formation when given prior to kynurenine, prevented sleep disturbances, and enhanced NREM sleep. Conclusion REM sleep was restored when PF-04859989 was administered prior to kynurenine challenge, suggesting that reducing KYNA attenuated the kynurenine-induced decrease in REM. Further, KAT II inhibition may cause mild somnolence. Our findings suggest for the first time that reducing KYNA may serve as a potential strategy for improving sleep dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-session tDCS paired with passive mobilisation increases thalamo-cortical coupling during command following.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Therapeutic options for patients with prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC) are limited. PDOC patients often exhibit a dissociation between their retained level of (covert) cognitive ability and their (overt) behavioural responses (cognitive-motor dissociation; CMD). This is linked to reduced coupling between thalamus and the primary motor cortex. Objective: To assess whether pairing tDCS with a concurrent passive mobilisation protocol (designed to be feasible in PDOC) can influence thalamo-M1 dynamics and whether these changes are enhanced after multiple stimulation sessions. Methods: We used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 22 healthy participants to assess tDCS changes on effective connectivity within motor network areas during command-following. Results: We found that a single anodal tDCS session (paired with passive mobilisation of the thumb) decreased self-inhibition in the motor cortex, with five sessions further enhancing this effect. In addition, anodal tDCS increased thalamo-M1 excitation as compared to cathodal stimulation, with the effects maintained after 5 sessions. In turn, cathodal tDCS had opposing effects on these connections after one session but became more similar to anodal after 5. Conclusions: Together, our results suggest that pairing anodal tDCS with passive mobilisation across multiple sessions may facilitate behavioural command-following in PDOC patients with CMD. More broadly, they offer a mechanistic window into the neural underpinnings of the cumulative effects of multi-session tDCS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-fat diet feeding triggers a regenerative response in the adult zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a range of liver conditions ranging from excess fat accumulation to liver failure. NAFLD is strongly associated with high-fat diet (HFD) consumption that constitutes a metabolic risk factor. While HFD has been elucidated concerning its several systemic effects, there is little information about its influence on the brain at the molecular level. Here, by using a high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding of adult zebrafish, we first reveal that excess fat uptake results in weight gain and fatty liver. Prolonged exposure to HFD induces a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation markers in the liver and brain tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses of the brain tissues disclose stimulation of apoptosis and widespread activation of glial cell response. Moreover, glial activation is accompanied by an initial decrease in the number of neurons and their subsequent replacement in the olfactory bulb and the telencephalon. Long-term consumption of HFD causes activation of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling in the brain tissues. Finally, fish fed an HFD induces anxiety, and aggressiveness and increases locomotor activity. Thus, HFD feeding leads to a non-traumatic brain injury and stimulates a regenerative response. The activation mechanisms of a regeneration response in the brain can be exploited to fight obesity and recover from non-traumatic injuries.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep RNA-seq of male and female murine sensory neuron subtypes after nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons have been well described for their role in driving both acute and pain. Although nerve injury is known to cause transcriptional dysregulation, how this differs across neuronal subtypes and the impact of sex is unclear. Here, we study the deep transcriptional profiles of multiple murine DRG populations in early and late pain states while considering sex. We have exploited currently available transgenics to label numerous subpopulations for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and subsequent transcriptomic analysis. Using bulk tissue samples, we are able to circumvent the issues of low transcript coverage and drop-outs seen with single cell datasets. This increases our power to detect novel and even subtle changes in gene expression within neuronal subtypes and discuss sexual dimorphism at the neuronal subtype level. We have curated this resource into an accessible database for other researchers (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/). We see both stereotyped and unique subtype signatures in injured states after nerve injury at both an early and late timepoint. While all populations contribute to a general injury signature, subtype enrichment changes can also be seen. Within populations, there is not a strong intersection of sex and injury, but previously unknown sex differences in naive states- particularly in AB-RA + Ad-LTMRs - still contribute to differences in injured neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BrainAGE revisited: Keeping up the pace with deep learning methods</a></h4>

              
                Since the introduction of the BrainAGE method (Franke et al., 2010), novel machine learning methods of brain age prediction have continued to emerge. The idea of estimating the chronological age from (different modalities of) magnetic resonance images proved to be an interesting field of research due to the simplicity of its interpretation and its potential use as a biomarker of brain health. With the advancement of deep learning methods that are starting to dominate the field, it may seem like standard machine learning methods are not competitive anymore. Here we present our revised BrainAGE framework that combines multiple weighted BrainAGE models. We employed the analyses on a sample of 36840 T1-weighted images from the UK Biobank. The most accurate prediction with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.02 years was obtained by relevance vector regression weighted model combination. Our results are comparable to those of deep learning methods. We additionally tested the relation of different BrainAGE models and white matter hyperintensities as markers of ageing brain and found no differences in association to biomedical data between models of differing accuracies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG and pupillometric signatures of working memory overload</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the physiological correlates of cognitive overload has implications for gauging the limits of human cognition, for developing novel methods to define cognitive overload, and for mitigating the negative outcomes associated with overload. Most previous psychophysiological studies manipulated verbal working memory load in a narrow range (an average load of 5 items). It is unclear, however. how the nervous system responds to working memory load exceeding typical capacity limits. The objective of the current study was to characterize the central and autonomic nervous system changes associated with memory overload, by means of combined recording of EEG and pupillometry. Eighty-six participants were presented with a digit span task involving the serial auditory presentation of items. Each trial consisted of sequences of either 5, 9, or 13 digits, each separated by 2 seconds. Both theta activity and pupil size, after the initial rise, expressed a pattern of a short plateau and a decrease with reaching the state of memory overload, indicating that pupil size and theta possibly have similar neural mechanisms. Based on the described above triphasic pattern of pupil size temporal dynamics, we concluded that cognitive overload causes physiological systems to reset, and to release effort. Although memory capacity limits were exceeded and effort was released (as indicated by pupil dilation), alpha continued to decrease with increasing memory load. These results suggest that associating alpha with the focus of attention and distractor suppression is not warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A replication study on key neurodevelopmental pathways affected by valproate treatment ofneural precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                Adults with bipolar disorder or epileptic seizures are commonly prescribed sodium valproate. In utero exposure to this drug is linked to a multitude of defects in normal brain development, from neural tube defects to autism spectrum disorders. During the course of brain development, neural precursor cells (NPCs) give rise to neurons and glia, and therefore to understand the valproate-induced defects, it is crucial to understand its effect on NPCs. Two NPC lines, both derived from healthy individuals, were used for all experiments. Cells were treated with 0.7mM valproate for one week. Fresh media (+/- drug) was replenished every alternate day. RNA was extracted on day 7 of drug treatment, and transcriptomics performed. All experiments were performed in biological replicates. Genes that showed >1-fold difference (with FDR adjusted q-value [&le;] 0.05) were considered differentially expressed. We further investigated the interacting partners of the differentially expressed genes using PINOT, as well as cellular pathways using DAVID. Our primary endpoint of analysis were genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) with valproate treatment in both the NPC lines used. We found 21 such genes that were common in the two lines. PINOT revealed 504 interacting partners of the DEGs. Functional annotation analysis showed significant enrichment of four signaling pathways - Wnt, Notch, Rho-GTPase and PI3K-AKT. While the role of Rho-GTPase is a novel finding, we have replicated previously reported findings on Wnt, Notch and PI3K-Akt pathways, which further strengthens their role in mediating neurodevelopmental anomalies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG-LLAMAS: an open source, low latency, EEG-fMRI neurofeedback platform</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a powerful multimodal technique for imaging the brain, but its use in neurofeedback experiments has been limited by EEG noise caused by the MRI environment. Neurofeedback studies typically require analysis of EEG in real time, but EEG acquired inside the scanner is heavily contaminated with ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, a high-amplitude artifact locked to the cardiac cycle. Although techniques for removing BCG artifacts do exist, they are either not suited to real-time, low-latency applications, such as neurofeedback, or have limited efficacy. We propose and validate a new open-source BCG removal software called EEG-LLAMAS (Low Latency Artifact Mitigation Acquisition Software), which adapts and advances existing artifact removal techniques for low-latency experiments. We first used simulations to validate LLAMAS in data with known ground truth. We found that LLAMAS performed better than the best publicly-available real-time BCG removal technique, optimal basis sets (OBS), in terms of its ability to recover EEG waveforms, power spectra, and slow wave phase. To determine whether LLAMAS would be effective in practice, we then used it to conduct real-time EEG-fMRI recordings in healthy adults, using a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) task. We found that LLAMAS was able to recover the SSVEP in real time, and recovered the power spectra collected outside the scanner better than OBS. We also measured the latency of LLAMAS during live recordings, and found that it introduced a lag of less than 50ms on average. The low latency of LLAMAS, coupled with its improved artifact reduction, can thus be effectively used for EEG-fMRI neurofeedback. This platform enables closed-loop experiments which previously would have been prohibitively difficult, such as those that target short-duration EEG events, and is shared openly with the neuroscience community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supramodal Shape Representation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                We can sense an object's shape by vision or touch. Previous studies suggested that the inferolateral occipitotemporal cortex (ILOTC) implements supramodal shape representations as it responds more to seeing or touching objects than shapeless textures. However, such activation in the anterior portion of the ventral visual pathway could be due to the conceptual representation of an object or visual imagery triggered by touching an object. We addressed these possibilities by directly comparing shape and conceptual representations in early blind (who lack visual experience/imagery) and sighted participants. We found that bilateral ILOTC in both groups showed stronger activation during a shape verification task than during a conceptual verification task made on the names of the same manmade objects. Moreover, the distributed activity in the ILOTC encoded shape similarity but not conceptual association among objects. Besides the ILOTC, we also found shape representation in both groups' bilateral ventral premotor cortices and intraparietal sulcus, a frontoparietal circuit relating to object grasping and haptic processing. In contrast, the conceptual verification task activated both groups' left perisylvian brain network relating to language processing, and, interestingly, the cuneus in early blind participants only. The ILOTC had stronger functional connectivity to frontoparietal circuit than to the left perisylvian network, forming a modular structure specialized in shape representation. Our results conclusively support that the ILOTC selectively implements shape representation independently of visual experience, and this unique functionality likely comes from its privileged connection to the frontoparietal haptic circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heard or understood? Neural tracking of language features in a comprehensible story, an incomprehensible story and a word list</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension is a complex neural process on which relies on activation and integration of multiple brain regions. In the current study, we evaluated whether speech comprehension can be investigated by neural tracking. Neural tracking is the phenomenon in which the brain responds in a time-locked fashion to specific features of the speech. These features can be acoustic, i.e., acoustic tracking, or derived from the content of the speech using language properties, i.e., language tracking. We evaluated whether neural tracking of speech differs between a comprehensible story, an incomprehensible story, and a word list. We evaluated the neural responses to speech of 19 participants (6 men). No significant difference regarding acoustic tracking was found. However, significant language tracking was only found for the comprehensible story. The most prominent effect was visible to word surprisal, a language feature at the word level. The neural response to word surprisal showed a prominent negativity between 300 and 400~ms, similar to the N400 in evoked response paradigms. This N400 was significantly more negative when the story was be comprehended, i.e., when words could be integrated in the context of previous words. These results show that language tracking can capture the effect of speech comprehension.

                A key feature of advanced brain aging includes structural defects of intracortical myelin that are associated with secondary neuroinflammation. A similar pathology is seen in specific myelin mutant mice that model 'advanced brain aging' and exhibit a range of behavioral abnormalities. However, the cognitive assessment of these mutants is problematic because myelin-dependent motor-sensory functions are required for quantitative behavioral readouts. To better understand the role of cortical myelin integrity for higher brain functions, we generated mice lacking Plp1, encoding the major integral myelin membrane protein, selectively in ventricular zone stem cells of the mouse forebrain. In contrast to conventional Plp1 null mutants, subtle myelin defects were restricted to the cortex, hippocampus and underlying callosal tracts. Moreover, forebrain-specific Plp1 mutants exhibited no defect of basic motor-sensory performance at any age tested. Surprisingly, several behavioral alterations reported for conventional Plp1 null mice (Gould et al., 2018) were absent and even social interactions appeared normal. However, with novel behavioral paradigms, we determined catatonia-like symptoms and isolated executive dysfunction in both genders. This suggests that loss of myelin integrity has an impact on cortical connectivity and underlies specific defects of executive function. These observations are likewise relevant for human neuropsychiatric conditions and other myelin-related diseases.

                Anopheles mosquitoes, as vectors for the malaria parasite, are a global threat to human health. To find and bite a human, they utilize neurons within their sensory appendages. However, the identity and quantification of sensory appendage neurons are lacking. Here we use a neurogenetic approach to label all neurons in Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. We utilize the Homology Assisted CRISPR Knock-in (HACK) approach to generate a T2A-QF2w knock-in of the synaptic gene bruchpilot. We use a membrane-targeted GFP reporter to visualize the neurons in the brain and to quantify neurons in all major chemosensory appendages (antenna, maxillary palp, labella, tarsi). By comparing labeling of brp>GFP and Orco>GFP mosquitoes, we predict the extent of neurons expressing Ionotropic Receptors or other chemosensory receptors. This work introduces a valuable genetic tool for the functional analysis of Anopheles mosquito neurobiology and initiates characterization of the sensory neurons that guide mosquito behavior.

                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of cck gene (CCK-/-) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation (LTP) upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the motor cortex of CCK-/- mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuronal plasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signalling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivating the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of CCK-/- mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, enables neuroplasticity in the motor cortex leading to motor skill learning.

We previously validated the anatomical fiducial (AFID) placement protocol for point-based assessment of image registration with millimetric (mm) accuracy. In this data descriptor, we release curated AFID placements for some of the most commonly used structural magnetic resonance imaging templates and datasets. The release of our accurate placements allows for rapid quality control of image registration, teaching neuroanatomy, and clinical applications such as disease diagnosis and surgical targeting. We release placements on individual subjects from four datasets (n = 132 subjects for a total of 15,232 fiducials) and more than 10 brain templates (4,288 fiducials), compiling over 300 human rater hours of annotation. We also validate human rater accuracy of released placements to be within 1-2 mm (using a total of 50,336 Euclidean distances), consistent with prior studies. Our data is compliant with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) allowing for facile incorporation into modern neuroimaging analysis pipelines.

However, the molecular basis of these different fates is not understood. Here, we identify small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) as a causal factor in regeneration failure. We demonstrate that the SLRPs Chondroadherin, Fibromodulin, Lumican, and Prolargin are enriched in human, but not zebrafish, CNS lesions. Targeting SLRPs to the zebrafish injury ECM inhibits axon regeneration and functional recovery. Mechanistically, we find that SLRPs confer structural and mechanical properties to the lesion environment that are adverse to axon growth. Our study reveals SLRPs as previously unknown inhibitory ECM factors in the human CNS that impair axon regeneration by modifying tissue mechanics and structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The shadowing effect of initial expectation on learning asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                Evidence for positivity and optimism bias abounds in high-level belief updates. However, no consensus has been reached regarding whether learning asymmetries exists in more elementary forms of updates such as reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, the learning asymmetry concerns the sensitivity difference in incorporating positive and negative prediction errors (PE) into value estimation, namely the asymmetry of learning rates associated with positive and negative PEs. Although RL has been established as a canonical framework in interpreting agent and environment interactions, the direction of the learning rate asymmetry remains controversial. Here, we propose that part of the controversy stems from the fact that people may have different value expectations before entering the learning environment. Such default value expectation influences how PEs are calculated and consequently biases subjects' choices. We test this hypothesis in two learning experiments with stable or varying reinforcement probabilities, across monetary gains, losses and gain-loss mixtures environments. Our results consistently support the model incorporating asymmetric learning rates and initial value expectation, highlighting the role of initial expectation in value update and choice preference. Further simulation and model parameter recovery analyses confirm the unique contribution of initial value expectation in accessing learning rate asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unraveling Spatial-Spectral Dynamics of Speech Categorization Speed using Convolutional Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                The process of categorizing sounds into distinct phonetic categories is known as categorical perception (CP). Response times (RTs) provide a measure of perceptual difficulty during labeling decisions (i.e., categorization). The RT is quasi-stochastic in nature due to individuality and variations in perceptual tasks. To identify the source of RT variation in CP, we have built models to decode the brain regions and frequency bands driving fast, medium, and slow response decision speeds. In particular, we implemented parameter optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify listeners' behavioral RTs from their neural EEG data. We adopted visual interpretation of model response using Guided-GradCAM to identify spatial-spectral correlates of RT. Our framework includes (but is not limited to): (i) a data augmentation technique designed to reduce noise and control the overall variance of EEG dataset; (ii) bandpower topomaps to learn the spatial-spectral representation using CNN; (iii) large-scale Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to find best performing CNN model; (iv) ANOVA and post-hoc analysis on Guided-GradCAM activation values to measure the effect of neural regions and frequency bands on behavioral responses. Using this framework, we observe that  - {beta} (10-20 Hz) activity over left frontal, right prefrontal/frontal, and right cerebellar regions are correlated with RT variation. Our results indicate that attention, template matching, temporal prediction of acoustics, motor control, and decision uncertainty are the most probable factors in RT variation.

                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small region in the pons and the main source of noradrenaline (NA) to the forebrain. While traditional models suggested that all LC-NA neurons project indiscriminately throughout the brain, accumulating evidence indicates that these cells can be heterogeneous based on their anatomical connectivity and behavioral functionality and exhibit distinct coding modes. How LC-NA neuronal subpopulations are endowed with unique functional properties is unclear. Here, we used a viral-genetic approach for mapping anatomical connectivity at different levels of organization based on inputs and outputs of defined cell classes. Specifically, we studied the whole-brain afferent inputs onto two functionally distinct LC-NA neuronal subpopulations which project to amygdala or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We found that the global input distribution is similar for both LC-NA neuronal subpopulations. However, finer analysis demonstrated important differences in inputs from specific brain regions. Moreover, sex related differences were apparent, but only in inputs to amygdala-projecting LC-NA neurons. These findings reveal a cell type and sex specific afferent input organization which could allow for context dependent and target specific control of NA outflow to forebrain structures involved in emotional control and decision making.

                Imbalanced purine metabolism is a key neurological basis for suicide and mood disorders (MD), wherein purinergic receptors in stress-sensitive cerebral regions are thought to be differentially activated. A hippocampal network that links the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex implements an affective sensation of stress. We discovered that the hippocampus encoded fatal suicidal ideations in the dentate gyrus (DG) by a considerable amount of the granule cell nuclei with P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2RX7) expression, irrespective of the underlying MD. Compared to controls, patients with MD showed microglial dyshomeostasis throughout the hippocampal formation. Strikingly, P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2RY12)-expressing microglia with segmented processes were remarkably present in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (mEnt) in individuals with fatal suicidality. In the hypothalamic stress-sensitive nuclei, P2RY12+ microglia were more expressed in the supraoptic nucleus in MD and even higher when fatal suicidality was present. In the prefrontal cortex, P2RX7 transcripts sharply dropped in suicidal individuals, possibly removing the prefrontal inhibition of the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Confounder analysis showed that the suicide-specific molecular features faded when the postmortem delay was prolonged. Our findings imply that fatal suicidality presents with unique neuropathological alterations. The DG and mEnt are two crucial areas for deciphering the suicidal consequences. By including brain samples from legal euthanasia donors, suicide-specific biosignatures can be maximally retained. Decoding the bioactive framework through key genes, brain regions and neurological processes involved in suicide neuropathology may provide novel therapeutic strategies for suicidal individuals who are beyond the reach of mental health care.

                Effort-based decisions, in which people weigh potential future rewards against effort costs required to achieve those rewards, have largely been studied separately for cognitive or physical effort, yet most real world actions incur both cognitive and physical effort costs. What is the relationship between cognitive and physical effort costs? Here we attempt to formalize the mechanisms underlying effort-based decisions and address methodological challenges to isolate and measure the factors contributing to such decisions (including sensitivity to reward and effort costs). Patch foraging is an ecologically valid reward rate maximization problem with well developed theoretical tools to understand choices. We developed the Effort Foraging Task to isolate and quantify the cost of both cognitive and physical effort using a computational model. We embedded cognitive or physical effort costs into a patch foraging sequential decision task. Participants chose between harvesting a depleting patch, or traveling to a new patch that was costly in time and effort. Participants' exit thresholds (reflecting the reward they expected to receive by harvesting when they chose to travel to a new patch) were sensitive to cognitive and physical effort demands, allowing us to quantify the perceived effort cost in monetary terms. Individual differences in cognitive and physical effort costs were positively correlated, suggesting that these are perceived and processed in common terms across different domains. We found patterns of correlation of both cognitive and physical effort costs with self-reported cognitive function, anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. This suggests that our task captures decision mechanisms closely associated with real-world motivation, and can be used to study individual variation in effort-based decisions across different domains of cost.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive biasing of action-selective cortical build-upactivity by choice history</a></h4>

              
                Decisions under uncertainty are often biased by the history of preceding sensory input, behavioral choices, or received outcomes. Behavioral studies of perceptual decisions suggest that such history-dependent biases affect the accumulation of evidence within trials and can be adapted to the correlation structure of the sensory environment. Here, we systematically varied this correlation structure while human participants performed a canonical perceptual choice task. We tracked the trial-by-trial variations of history biases via behavioral modeling and of neural signatures of evidence accumulation via magnetoencephalography (MEG). The history bias was flexibly adapted to the environment, and it exerted a selective effect on the build-up of action-selective motor cortical activity during decision formation, over and above the impact of the current stimulus. We conclude that the build-up of action plans in human motor cortical circuits is shaped by dynamic prior expectations that result from an adaptive interaction with the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior movement of one arm facilitates motor adaptation in the other</a></h4>

              
                Many movements in daily life are embedded in motion sequences that involve more than one limb, demanding the motor system to monitor and control different body parts in quick succession. During such movements, systematic changes in the environment or the body might require motor adaptation of specific segments. However, previous motor adaptation research has focused primarily on motion sequences produced by a single limb, or on simultaneous movements of several limbs. For example, adaptation to opposing force fields is possible in unimanual reaching tasks when the direction of a prior or subsequent movement is predictive of force field direction. It is unclear, however, whether multi-limb sequences can support motor adaptation processes in a similar way. In the present study, we investigated whether reaches can be adapted to different force fields in a bimanual motor sequence when the information about the perturbation is associated with the prior movement direction of the other arm. In addition, we examined whether prior perceptual (visual or proprioceptive) feedback of the opposite arm contributes to force field-specific motor adaptation. Our key finding is that only active participation in the bimanual sequential task supports pronounced adaptation. This result suggests that active segments in bimanual motion sequences are linked across limbs. If there is a consistent association between movement kinematics of the linked and goal movement, the learning process of the goal movement can be facilitated. More generally, if motion sequences are repeated often, prior segments can evoke specific adjustments of subsequent movements.

                Objective: Multiple studies have explored the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to enhance visual function. These studies vary in sample size, outcome measures, and NIBS methodology. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess the effects of NIBS on visual functions in human participants with normal vision. Methods: We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and a review protocol was registered with PROSPERO before study commencement (CRD42021255882). We searched Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, OpenGrey and Web of Science using relevant keywords. The search covered the period from 1st January 2000 until 1st September 2021. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software was used for quantitative analysis. Results: Forty-nine studies were included, of which 19 were included in a meta-analysis (38.8%). Meta-analysis indicated acute (Hedges's g=0.232, 95% CI: 0.023-0.442, p=0.029) and aftereffects (0.590, 95% CI: 0.182-0.998, p=0.005) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES, including three different stimulation protocols) on contrast sensitivity. Visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes were significantly enhanced immediately after tES (0.383, 95% CI: 0.110-0.665, p=0.006). Both tES (0.563, 95% CI: 0.230 to 0.896, p=0.001) and anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) alone (0.655, 95% CI: 0.273 to 1.038, p=0.001) reduced crowding in peripheral vision. The effects of NIBS on visual acuity, motion perception and reaction time were not statistically significant. Conclusions: There are significant effects of visual cortex NIBS on contrast sensitivity, VEP amplitude, an index of cortical excitability, and crowding among normally sighted individuals. Future studies with robust experimental designs are needed to substantiate these findings in populations with vision loss.

                Participant-specific, functionally-defined brain areas are usually mapped with functional localizers and estimated by making contrasts between responses to single categories of input. Naturalistic stimuli engage multiple brain systems in parallel, provide more ecologically plausible estimates of real-world statistics, and are friendly to special populations. The current study shows that cortical functional topographies in individual participants can be estimated with high fidelity from naturalistic stimuli. Importantly, we demonstrate that robust, individualized estimates can be obtained even when participants watched different movies, were scanned with different parameters/scanners, and were sampled from different institutes across the world. Our results create a foundation for future studies that allow researchers to estimate a broad range of functional topographies based on naturalistic movies and a normative database, making it possible to integrate high-level cognitive functions across datasets from laboratories worldwide.

                It is becoming increasingly apparent that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in an array of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to characterize changes in microglial density and morphology associated with neuroinflammation, but these were conducted mostly ex vivo and/or in extreme, non-physiological animal models. Here, we build upon these studies by investigating the utility of well-established dMRI methods to detect neuroinflammation in vivo in a more clinically relevant animal model. We show that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) indicate widespread increases in diffusivity in the brains of rats given a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. These diffusivity changes correlated with histologically measured changes in microglial morphology, confirming the sensitivity of dMRI to neuroinflammatory processes. This study marks a further step towards establishing a noninvasive biomarker of neuroinflammation, which would greatly facilitate early diagnosis and treatment monitoring in various neurological and psychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feedback brings scene information to the representation of occluded image regions in area V1 of monkeys and humans</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) is driven by feedforward input from within the neurons' receptive fields (RFs) and modulated by contextual information in regions surrounding the RF. The effect of contextual information on spiking activity occurs rapidly, and is therefore challenging to dissociate from feedforward input. To address this challenge, we recorded the spiking activity of V1 neurons in monkeys viewing either natural scenes or scenes where the information in the RF was occluded, effectively removing the feedforward input. We found that V1 neurons responded rapidly and selectively to occluded scenes. V1 responses elicited by occluded stimuli could be used to decode scene identity and could be predicted from those elicited by non-occluded images, indicating that there is overlap between visually-driven and contextual responses. We used representational similarity analysis to show that the structure of V1 representations of occluded scenes measured with electrophysiology in monkeys correlates strongly with the representations of the same scenes in humans measured with fMRI. Our results reveal that contextual influences alter the spiking activity of V1 in monkeys across large distances on a rapid time scale, carry information about scene identity and resemble those in human V1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Appetitive cue exposure increases neural reward responses without modulating temporal discounting</a></h4>

              
                When given a choice, humans and many animals prefer smaller but sooner over larger but later rewards, a tendency referred to as temporal discounting. Alterations in devaluation of future rewards have been reported in a range of maladaptive behaviors and clinical conditions. Although temporal discounting is highly stable over time and testing environments (e.g., laboratory vs. virtual reality), it is partly under contextual control. For example, highly appetitive cues such as erotic images might increase preferences for immediate rewards, although overall evidence remains mixed. Dopaminergic circuit activity and striatal dopamine concentrations are often assumed to drive increases in temporal discounting following appetitive cue-exposure, yet this was never explicitly tested. Here we examined cue-reactivity effects (erotic vs. neutral pictures) on subsequent temporal discounting in a pre-registered within-subjects study in healthy male participants (n=38). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessed neural cue-reactivity, value-computations and choice-related effects. Preregistered analyses replicated previous findings of value coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortices, striatum and cingulate cortex. Likewise, as hypothesized, lateral prefrontal cortex activity increased during choices of delayed rewards, potentially reflecting cognitive control. As predicted, erotic vs. neutral cue exposure was associated with increased activity in attention and reward circuits. Contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, temporal discounting was largely unaffected by cue exposure. Likewise, cue-reactivity in key areas of the dopaminergic reward circuit (Nacc, VTA) was not significantly associated with changes in behavior. Our results indicate that behavioral effects of erotic cue exposure on temporal discounting might not be as unequivocal as previously thought and raise doubt on the hypothesis of an upregulated dopaminergic ramping mechanism, that might support myopic approach behavior towards immediate rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion permeation pathway within the internal pore of P2X receptor channels</a></h4>

              
                P2X receptor channels are trimeric ATP-activated ion channels expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal cells that are attractive therapeutic targets for human disorders. Seven subtypes of P2X receptor channels have been identified in mammals that can form both homomeric and heteromeric channels. P2X1-4 and P2X7 receptor channels are cation selective, whereas P2X5 has been reported to have both cation and anion permeability. P2X receptor channel structures reveal that each subunit is comprised of two transmembrane helices, with both N-and C-termini on the intracellular side of the membrane, and a large extracellular domain that contains the ATP binding sites at subunit interfaces. Recent structures of ATP-bound P2X receptors with the activation gate open reveal the unanticipated presence of a cytoplasmic cap over the central ion permeation pathway, leaving lateral fenestrations that may be largely buried within the membrane as potential pathways for ions to permeate the intracellular end of the pore. In the present study we identify a critical residue within the intracellular lateral fenestrations that is readily accessible to thiol reactive compounds from both sides of the membrane and where substitutions influence the relative permeability of the channel to cations and anions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ions can enter or exit the internal pore through lateral fenestrations that play a critical role in determining the ion selectivity of P2X receptor channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Instantaneous antidepressant effect of lateral habenula deep brain stimulation in rats studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                The available treatments for depression have substantial limitations, including low response rates and substantial lag time before a response is achieved. We applied deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the lateral habenula (LHb) of two rat models of depression (Wistar Kyoto rats and lipopolysaccharide-treated rats) and observed an immediate (within seconds to minutes) alleviation of depressive-like symptoms with a high response rate. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) conducted on the same sets of depressive rats used in behavioral tests revealed DBS-induced activation of multiple regions in afferent and efferent circuitry of the LHb. The activation levels of brain regions connected to the medial LHb (M-LHb) was correlated with the extent of behavioral improvements. Rats with more medial stimulation sites in the LHb exhibited greater antidepressant effects than those with more lateral stimulation sites. These results indicated that the antidromic activation of the limbic system and orthodromic activation of the monoaminergic systems connected to the M-LHb played a critical role in the rapid antidepressant effects of LHb-DBS. This study indicates that M-LHb-DBS might act as a valuable, rapid-acting antidepressant therapeutic strategy for treatment-resistant depression and demonstrates the potential of using fMRI activation of specific brain regions as biomarkers to predict and evaluate antidepressant efficacy.

	<p>How speech prosody is processed in the brain during language production remains an unsolved issue. The present work used the phrase-recall paradigm to analyze brain oscillation underpinning rhythmic processing in speech production. Participants were told to recall target speeches aloud consisting of verb&amp;amp;ndash;noun pairings with a common (e.g., [2+2], the numbers in brackets represent the number of syllables) or uncommon (e.g., [1+3]) rhythmic pattern. Target speeches were preceded by rhythmic musical patterns, either congruent or incongruent, created by using pure tones at various temporal intervals. Electroencephalogram signals were recorded throughout the experiment. Behavioral results in 2+2 target speeches showed a rhythmic priming effect when comparing congruent and incongruent conditions. Cerebral-acoustic coherence analysis showed that neural activities synchronized with the rhythmic patterns of primes. Furthermore, target phrases that had congruent rhythmic patterns with a prime rhythm were associated with increased theta-band (4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz) activity in the time window of 400&amp;amp;ndash;800 ms in both the 2+2 and 1+3 target conditions. These findings suggest that rhythmic patterns can be processed online. Neural activities synchronize with the rhythmic input and speakers create an abstract rhythmic pattern before and during articulation in speech production.</p>

	<p>Adolescents tend to experience multiple motor-vehicle crashes (MVCs). Recent literature has thoroughly explored the psychological consequences following an MVC, but prior psychological functioning, the ability to regulate one&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotions and tendencies to impulsivity and aggressive behaviors have been far less explored. This study aims to explore the emotional&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral functioning, measured with the Youth Self-Report (YSR); emotional dysregulation, measured with the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS); impulsivity traits, measured with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11); and the capacity to be mindful, measured with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), in adolescents that have experienced one or more MVCs in a year. N = 295 adolescents who visited an emergency department for MVCs were divided in two groups based on the number of MVCs they had sustained over the course of a year. The adolescents in Group 1 sustained more than three MVCs, and adolescents in Group 2 sustained only one. Participants were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Adolescents showed difficulties in emotional regulation, impulsivity traits, aggressive behaviors and a low capacity to be mindful. These results may be useful in the creation of intervention and prevention programs focused on emotional awareness targets for adolescents.</p>

	<p>The self-perception or self-experience of patients with depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPD) is altered, leading to a profound disruption in self-awareness. The main aim of the study is to explore the characteristics of subliminal self-face processing in DPD patients. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study that has measured and evaluated subliminal self-processing in DPD. To better understand this, we examined the ability of patients with DPD and healthy controls (HC) to identify pictures of faces using an experimental paradigm of breaking continuous flash suppression. There were 23 DPD outpatients from Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University and 23 matched HC who participated in this experiment. The time needed for a face to break into awareness was taken as the measure of participants&amp;amp;rsquo; subliminal processing of that face. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the DPD patients and HC in subliminal reaction times to different faces. Under experimental conditions, the average reaction response of self-face recognition in the HC group was significantly faster than for a famous face. However, this difference was not observed in DPD patients, which means that DPD patients did not show the processing advantage of their own faces as did the HC. The results suggest a deficit in subliminal self-face processing in DPD.</p>

	<p>Background: Anxiety Disorder (AD) is among the most common psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Likewise, parental psychological distress (PPD) was linked to anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD. The aim of this study was to characterise, in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD, anxiety symptoms, the functional impairment associated and the presence of PPD. Methods: Participants were divided into three groups based on their diagnosis: children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD+AD, others with a diagnosis of AD but without a diagnosis of ASD, and others with a diagnosis of ASD but without a diagnosis of AD. Results: Group ASD+AD showed lower global functioning than Group ASD and Group AD. Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobias were more frequent in Group ASD+AD. Our findings also showed higher depressive symptoms in Group ASD+AD, both in the child and parent reports. Finally, parents of the Group ASD+AD revealed higher levels of PPD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that early assessment of AD with functional impairment associated with the role of PPD could define individualised treatments and consequently mean a better prognosis in children and adolescents with ASD and AD.</p>

	<p>The use of cannabinoids as therapeutic drugs has increased among aging populations recently. Age-related changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system could influence the effects of therapies that target the cannabinoid system. At the preclinical level, cannabidiol (CBD) induces anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and Alzheimer. Emerging evidence suggests that CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol have neuroprotective therapeutic-like effects on dementias. In clinical practice, cannabinoids are being used off-label to relieve symptoms of PD and AD. In fact, patients are using cannabis compounds for the treatment of tremor, non-motor symptoms, anxiety, and sleep assistance in PD, and managing responsive behaviors of dementia such as agitation. However, strong evidence from clinical trials is scarce for most indications. Some clinicians consider cannabinoids an alternative for older adults bearing Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s dementia with a poor response to first-line treatments. In our concept and experience, cannabinoids should never be considered a first-line treatment but could be regarded as an adjuvant therapy in specific situations commonly seen in clinical practice. To mitigate the risk of adverse events, the traditional dogma of geriatric medicine, starting with a low dose and proceeding with a slow titration regime, should also be employed with cannabinoids. In this review, we aimed to address preclinical evidence of cannabinoids in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD and AD and discuss potential off-label use of cannabinoids in clinical practice of these disorders.</p>

	<p>Although cladribine induces sustained reductions in peripheral T and B lymphocytes, little is known about its effect on axonal damage reduction in multiple sclerosis (MS), which could be demonstrated by assessing the serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels. We investigated the reduction/reconstitution of different lymphocyte subsets (LS) by verifying the correlation with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) and the variation in sNfL levels during cladribine treatment. We analysed 33 highly active relapsing MS patients and followed them up for 12 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.3 months; blood samples were collected at treatment start (W0) and after 8, 24 and 48 weeks. Seventeen patients (60.7%) showed NEDA during the first treatment. At week 8, we observed a significant decrease in B memory cells, B regulatory 1 CD19+/CD38+ and B regulatory 2 CD19+/CD25+, a significant increase in T regulatory CD4+/CD25+, a slight increase in T cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ and a non-significant decrease in T helper CD3+/CD4+. Starting from week 24, the B subsets recovered; however, at week 48, CD19+/CD38+ and CD19+/CD25+ reached values near the baseline, while the Bmem were significantly lower. The T cell subsets remained unchanged except for CD4+/CD25+, which increased compared to W0. The LS changes were not predictive of NEDA achievement. The sNfL levels were significantly lower at week 24 (p = 0.046) vs. baseline. These results could demonstrate how cladribine, by inflammatory activity depletion, can also reduce axonal damage, according to the sNfL levels.</p>

	<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is an insidious neurodegenerative disease characterised by a precipitous decline in cognition, sleep disturbances, motor impairment and psychiatric features. Recently, criteria for prodromal DLB (pDLB) including clinical features and biomarkers have been put forward to aid the classification and research of this ambiguous cohort of patients. Researchers can use these criteria to classify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) as either possible (either one core clinical feature or one biomarker are present) or probable pDLB (at least two core clinical features, or one core clinical feature and at least one biomarker present). However, as isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) confirmed with polysomnography (PSG) can be included as both a clinical and a biomarker feature, potentially reducing the specificity of these diagnostic criteria. To address this issue, the current study classified a cohort of 47 PSG-confirmed iRBD patients as probable prodromal DLB only in the presence of an additional core feature or if there was an additional non-PSG biomarker. Thirteen iRBD patients demonstrated MCI (iRBD-MCI). In the iRBD-MCI group, one presented with parkinsonism and was thus classified as probable pDLB, whilst the remaining 12 were classified as only possible pDLB. All patients performed three tasks designed to measure attentional deficits, visual hallucinations and visuospatial impairment. Patients also attended clinical follow-ups to monitor for transition to DLB or another synucleinopathy. Findings indicated that the only patient categorised by virtue of having two core clinical features as probable pDLB transitioned over 28 months to a diagnosis of DLB. The performance of this probable pDLB patient was also ranked second-highest for their hallucinatory behaviours and had comparatively lower visuospatial accuracy. These findings highlight the need for more stringent diagnostic research criteria for pDLB, given that only one of the 13 patients who would have satisfied the current guidelines for probable pDLB transitioned to DLB after two years and was indeed the patient with two orthogonal core clinical features.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Rapid review on monkeypox policies among the G20 nations: relevance to policy and practitioner [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Monkeypox has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO Director General (WHO-DG). Most of the G20 nations have reported Monkeypox outbreak. Policies developed and implemented in G20 countries for the prevention and control of monkeypox preparedness and response have global consequences. This rapid review aimed to map the monkeypox prevention and control policies planned and implemented in G20 nations in line with temporary recommendations issued by the WHO-DG. Methods: We mapped monkeypox prevention and control policies in G20 nations based on the WHO-DG recommendations. Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, and ProQuest Health and Medical Complete were searched to understand G20 preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic policies. We also performed an extensive gray literature search through the Ministry of Health websites and newspaper through Google.  The documents/ studies that had an information on prevention, control and management guidelines/policies and published through journal, news articles and health ministry websites of G20 nations on monkeypox were included. We excluded the editorials, opinion, and perspective papers and studies published prior to May 6, 2022. Results: We obtained 671 articles with 10 articles included in the review. Additionally, we identified 55 documents from the gray literature. We included national guidelines of the 18 countries on the control, prevention, and management of monkeypox. National guidelines were compared with the WHO guidelines in terms of implementing coordinated response, engaging and protecting communities, surveillance and public health measures and international travel, clinical management and infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures and medical countermeasures research. Depending on the availability of resources, some recommendations are followed by nations while others are not. Conclusions: Coordinated response among states is key to contain the transmission of monkeypox. To bring a coordinated response, G20 nations are following temporary recommendations that are context specific to their nation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ Satisfaction Of Online Learning In Oman [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to the development facilitated by modern technology, the world has become a small village with instantly changing methods of education. Online education has become an alternative method for course delivery used by colleges and universities globally.   Methods: The population of this study was N=564 students enrolled in asynchronous online learning at the College of Sharia Sciences in the Sultanate of Oman for the academic year 2020-2021. The survey instruments from “The Student Satisfaction Survey” developed by Strachota (2006) were utilized in this study. The survey included items in the following categories: demographics, learner instructor's interaction, learner-peer interaction, and lastly general satisfaction. The researcher reformulated the questions to suit the target group and some questions were changed to suit the target audience.  Results: Remarkably, the data show that there is no direct relationship between demographic factors and student satisfaction with asynchronous online learning. On the other hand, there is a strong and noticeable relationship between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-instructor interaction. There is also a correlation between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-peer interaction.   Conclusions: The students of the College of Sharia Sciences are on the whole very satisfied with asynchronous online learning; they consider it a very successful experience and recommend its use by students in other educational institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Explaining the unexpected COVID-19 trends and potential impact across Africa. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Official COVID-19 case counts and mortality rates across Africa are lower than had been anticipated. Research reports, however, indicate far higher exposure rates than the official counts in some countries. Particularly in Western and Central Africa, where mortality rates are disproportionately lower than the rest of the continent, this occurrence may be due to immune response adaptations resulting from (1) frequent exposure to certain pro-inflammatory pathogens, and (2) a prevalence of low-grade inflammation coupled with peculiar modifications to the immune response based on one’s immunobiography. We suggest that the two factors lead to a situation where post infection, there is a rapid ramp-up of innate immune responses, enough to induce effective defense and protection against plethora pathogens. Alongside current efforts at procuring and distributing vaccines, we draw attention to the need for work towards appreciating the impact of the apparently widespread, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections on Africa’s populations vis a vis systemic inflammation status and long-term consequences for public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of a peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Frequent positional changes and movements during labour is one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent prolonged labour, thereby avoiding cesarean sections. However, labour induction, continuous fetal monitoring in supine position and immobilising the women during labour are standard practices in most private hospitals. To combat these problems and to implement WHO recommendations, the peanut ball is an effective device through which frequent positional changes will be achieved without disrupting the labour procedures. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes and assess the stress response induced by labour in terms of maternal and neonatal cortisol in low-risk primigravid women. The study is a prospective, block randomised controlled trial with parallel arms. A total of 768 study participants will be randomised to the peanut-ball group (intervention) and standard care group (control). The intervention group will receive different peanut ball positions during labour at or after 4 cm of cervical dilatation. The primary outcomes of the study are maternal outcome that includes measurement of duration of the active and the second stage of labour, stress level as measured by serum cortisol level at 3–4 cm and at 10 cm of cervical dilatation, mode of delivery, perception of pain, behavioural response during the active stage of labour and neonatal outcomes, which includes the pattern of fetal heart rate, APGAR score, birth injuries, and umbilical serum and salivary cortisol level. The collected data will be compared between the intervention and control groups.  Trial Registration: This research is registered under the CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry of India) (CTRI/2019/08/020802) (21/8/2019).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of mobile health education messages verses face-to-face consultation for weight reduction among overweight female adolescents in Thailand [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obesity is considered a significant public health problem in Thailand. This study was conducted to compare the impact of mobile health education messages verses face-to-face consultation on weight reduction among overweight female university students. Methods: This Quasi-experimental study comprised three groups: a control group, a group receiving mobile health education, and a group receiving face-to-face consultation. Each group contained 26 participants taking part over a period of 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up thereafter. The data analysis used two-way repeated measures ANOVA with least significant difference testing. The study was ethically approved at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Results: The results revealed that the intervention found significant results in weight reduction among the respondents (p < 0.05). In addition, both intervention groups significantly improved their health belief, social support, and health behavior scores in comparison to the control group (p < 0.001). The results show that the average scores for social support for eating and exercise at baseline were significantly lower than at post-intervention or follow-up (p < 0.001). In addition, the results of both aspects of social support showed that the average social support score at post-intervention was significantly higher than at follow-up. Furthermore, the health behavior score measured post-intervention was higher than at follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in average metabolism during physical activity (p < 0.001) but no statistical difference in average eating behavior score. Conclusion: The study found that the use of mobile health education to deliver health programs facilitates communication between the healthcare provider and individual, and can empower adolescent females in their pursuit of weight loss by improving their attitudes and knowledge, leading to better health behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in prevalence and patterns of use of a heated tobacco product (IQOS™) in Japan: A three-year repeated cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous smoke-free tobacco or nicotine-containing product (TNP) alternatives have been introduced to support individual- and population-level harm reduction relative to continued cigarette smoking. This article details the nationwide prevalence and patterns of TNP use between 2016 and 2019 in Japan following the commercialization of IQOS™, a smoke-free heated tobacco product (HTP). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted over a period of three study years (2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019) in representative samples of the Japanese general adult population and samples of Japanese adult IQOS users registered in the IQOS owner database of Philip Morris International’s affiliate in Japan. Results: Across the three study years (Y1-Y3), the prevalence of overall current TNP use (Y1-Y3: 18.5%, 18.9%, and 18.2%) and overall TNP use by age and sex remained similar. However, there was a growing shift from cigarette smoking to smoke-free TNP use across the three study years. While the cigarette smoking prevalence (Y1-Y3: 17.6%, 17.3%, and 16.0%) decreased, the use prevalence of smoke-free TNPs, including the HTP IQOS™ (Y1-Y3: 1.8%, 3.2%, and 3.3%) and e-cigarettes (Y1-Y3, 0.7%, 1.6%, and 2.0%) increased. At the same time, TNP initiation, TNP relapse, and TNP reinitiation with IQOS were all very low across the three study years. Across Y1-Y3, exclusive use of only one type of TNP (Y1-Y3: 82.3%, 75.0%, and 70.4%) decreased, while dual use of two types of TNPs (Y1-Y3: 14.3%, 17.2%, and 16.7%) increased, and poly-TNP use (Y1-Y3: 2.1%, 6.1%, and 10.0%) increased markedly. Moreover, the majority of adult IQOS users were exclusive IQOS users. Conclusions: These trends in IQOS use behavior suggest that IQOS™ has the potential to switch adult smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free tobacco products, which presents a harm reduction opportunity, and that HTPs are effective tools for complementing current tobacco control measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The circadian clock mediates the response to oxidative stress in a cone photoreceptor‒like (661W) cell line via regulation of glutathione peroxidase activity [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mammalian retina contains an autonomous circadian clock that controls many physiological functions within this tissue. Our previous studies have indicated that disruption of this circadian clock by removing Bmal1 from the retina affects the visual function, retinal circuitry, and cone photoreceptor viability during aging. In the present study, we employed a mouse-derived cone photoreceptor‒like cell, 661W, to investigate which molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock may modulate cone photoreceptor viability during aging. Methods: Bmal1 knockout (BKO) cells were generated from 661W cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. Deletion of Bmal1 from 661W was verified by western blot and monitoring Per2-luc bioluminescence circadian rhythms. To investigate the effect of Bmal1 removal on an oxidative stress challenge, cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2,1 mM) for two hours and then cell viability was assessed. Cells were also cultured and harvested for gene expression analysis and antioxidant assay. Results: Our data indicated that 661W cells contain a functional circadian clock that mediates the response to an oxidative stress challenge in vitro and that such a response is no longer present in the BKO cell. We also hypothesized that the effect was due to the circadian regulation of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Our results revealed that in 661W cells, the antioxidant defense mechanism showed time dependent variation , whereas in BKO cells, there was an overall reduction in this antioxidant defense mechanism, and it no longer showed time dependent variation. Conclusions: Our work supported the notion that the presence of a functional circadian clock and its ability to modulate the response to an oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism that may protect cones during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children,adolescents and adults with CD who followed a gluten free diet an who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 ± 15.64 years) with CD was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets. Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.

                Gaultheria nummularioides D.Don 1825 (Ericaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The complete chloroplast genome of G. nummularioides has been sequenced and assembled. The genome is 176,207 bp in total with one large single copy (LSC: 107,726 bp), one small single copy (SSC: 3,389 bp), and two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb; each 32,546 bp). The chloroplast genome encoded a total of 110 unique genes; the GC content of these genes is 36.6%. The results based on phylogenetic analysis confirmed that G. nummularioides diverged later than G. praticola, and the sister-group relationship between G. nummularioides and the clade comprising G. fragrantissima Wall. 1820 and G. hookeri C.B.Clarke 1882 was strongly supported, revealing the phylogenetic position of G. nummularioides. This work provides additional information for studying the genetic diversity of G. nummularioides and its closely related taxa, as well as further exploration of chloroplast genomes in the Ericaceae family.

                Background: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze the experiences in regard to the application of criminalistic and criminological protocols and procedures, which were used to carry out the intervention in the premises of Thomas Restobar in Peru, in the context of the declaration of sanitary measures to control COVID 19. This police intervention resulted in the death of 13 people. Methods: For the collection of information, we used the focus group technique, for which a script was designed and validated by five experts, considering six major subcategories: C1SC1: Joint investigation and prosecution work, C1SC2: Protocols and guidelines, C1SC3: Chain of custody (police, experts, and prosecutor), C1SC4: Quality of results; C2SC1: Participation of agents of Thomas Restobar and the municipality, C2SC2: Compliance with DIGESA-DIRIS health regulations. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Universidad Norbert Wiener, with approval file N°864-2021. Results: From the criminological analysis it became evident that the deficiencies identified in the six structured subcategories have led to the tragic death of thirteen people from asphyxiation. The people who attended this bar did not comply with the sanitary norms, exposing the health and life of their relatives and other people. The security agents of the premises and of the Municipality of Los Olivos did not comply with the norms of supervision and control, which finally led to the unfortunate death of 13 people from asphyxiation, closely related to the case of Utopia, in 2002. Conclusions: When evaluated by the experts of the focus group, it has generated two emerging categories: creation of a School of Experts and the categorization of the experience, which would prevent cases like Utopia and Thomas Restobar from happening again.

                <p>by Alexander Klug, Joachim Krug</p>

Understanding the benefits and costs of recombination under different scenarios of evolutionary adaptation remains an open problem for theoretical and experimental research. In this study, we focus on finite populations evolving on neutral networks comprising viable and unfit genotypes. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of recombination by jointly considering different measures of evolvability and mutational robustness over a broad parameter range, such that many evolutionary regimes are covered. We find that several of these measures vary non-monotonically with the rates of mutation and recombination. Moreover, the presence of unfit genotypes that introduce inhomogeneities in the network of viable states qualitatively alters the effects of recombination. We conclude that conflicting trends induced by recombination can be explained by an emerging trade-off between evolvability on the one hand, and mutational robustness on the other. Finally, we discuss how different implementations of the recombination scheme in theoretical models can affect the observed dependence on recombination rate through a coupling between recombination and genetic drift.

The field of optimal experimental design uses mathematical techniques to determine experiments that are maximally informative from a given experimental setup. Here we apply a technique from artificial intelligence—reinforcement learning—to the optimal experimental design task of maximizing confidence in estimates of model parameter values. We show that a reinforcement learning approach performs favourably in comparison with a one-step ahead optimisation algorithm and a model predictive controller for the inference of bacterial growth parameters in a simulated chemostat. Further, we demonstrate the ability of reinforcement learning to train over a distribution of parameters, indicating that this approach is robust to parametric uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Social dilemmas of sociality due to beneficial and costly contagion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel B. Cooney, Dylan H. Morris, Simon A. Levin, Daniel I. Rubenstein, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Levels of sociality in nature vary widely. Some species are solitary; others live in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased levels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations and beneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful contagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these contagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an explicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed by contagion remains elusive. We consider a model for the evolution of sociality strategies in the presence of both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study the dynamics of this model at three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model to describe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a replicator equation to study the changing fractions of two different levels of sociality, and an adaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution of the population level of sociality. For a wide range of assumptions about the benefits and costs of infection, we identify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable sociality strategy (ESS) is distinct from the collective optimum—the level of sociality that would be best for all individuals. In particular, the ESS level of social interaction is greater (respectively less) than the social optimum when the good contagion spreads more (respectively less) readily than the bad contagion. Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the evolution of social interaction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily lead populations to social structures that are good for any or all.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused both a health and economic crisis around the world. Its papain-like protease (PLpro) is one of the protein targets utilized in designing new drugs that would aid vaccines in the fight against the virus. Although there are already several potential candidates for a good inhibitor of this protein, the degree of variability of the protein itself is not taken into account. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 can mutate to a high degree, but PLpro variability has not been studied to date. Based on sequence data available in databases, we analyzed the mutational potential of this protein. We focused on the effect of observed mutations on inhibitors’ binding mode and their efficacy as well as protein’s activity. Our analysis identifies five mutations that should be monitored and included in the drug design process: P247S, E263D-Y264H and T265A-Y268C.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HELIOS: High-speed sequence alignment in optics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ehsan Maleki, Saeedeh Akbari Rokn Abadi, Somayyeh Koohi</p>

In response to the imperfections of current sequence alignment methods, originated from the inherent serialism within their corresponding electrical systems, a few optical approaches for biological data comparison have been proposed recently. However, due to their low performance, raised from their inefficient coding scheme, this paper presents a novel all-optical high-throughput method for aligning DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, named HELIOS. The HELIOS method employs highly sophisticated operations to locate character matches, single or multiple mutations, and single or multiple indels within various biological sequences. On the other hand, the HELIOS optical architecture exploits high-speed processing and operational parallelism in optics, by adopting wavelength and polarization of optical beams. For evaluation, the functionality and accuracy of the HELIOS method are approved through behavioral and optical simulation studies, while its complexity and performance are estimated through analytical computation. The accuracy evaluations indicate that the HELIOS method achieves a precise pairwise alignment of two sequences, highly similar to those of Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch, BLAST, MUSCLE, ClustalW, ClustalΩ, T-Coffee, Kalign, and MAFFT. According to our performance evaluations, the HELIOS optical architecture outperforms all alternative electrical and optical algorithms in terms of processing time and memory requirement, relying on its highly sophisticated method and optical architecture. Moreover, the employed compact coding scheme highly escalates the number of input characters, and hence, it offers reduced time and space complexities, compared to the electrical and optical alternatives. It makes the HELIOS method and optical architecture highly applicable for biomedical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Coupling and heterogeneity modulate pacemaking capability in healthy and diseased two-dimensional sinoatrial node tissue models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chiara Campana, Eugenio Ricci, Chiara Bartolucci, Stefano Severi, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Both experimental and modeling studies have attempted to determine mechanisms by which a small anatomical region, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN), can robustly drive electrical activity in the human heart. However, despite many advances from prior research, important questions remain unanswered. This study aimed to investigate, through mathematical modeling, the roles of intercellular coupling and cellular heterogeneity in synchronization and pacemaking within the healthy and diseased SAN. In a multicellular computational model of a monolayer of either human or rabbit SAN cells, simulations revealed that heterogenous cells synchronize their discharge frequency into a unique beating rhythm across a wide range of heterogeneity and intercellular coupling values. However, an unanticipated behavior appeared under pathological conditions where perturbation of ionic currents led to reduced excitability. Under these conditions, an intermediate range of intercellular coupling (900–4000 MΩ) was beneficial to SAN automaticity, enabling a very small portion of tissue (3.4%) to drive propagation, with propagation failure occurring at both lower and higher resistances. This protective effect of intercellular coupling and heterogeneity, seen in both human and rabbit tissues, highlights the remarkable resilience of the SAN. Overall, the model presented in this work allowed insight into how spontaneous beating of the SAN tissue may be preserved in the face of perturbations that can cause individual cells to lose automaticity. The simulations suggest that certain degrees of gap junctional coupling protect the SAN from ionic perturbations that can be caused by drugs or mutations.

                Background: Hemithyroidectomy is one of the most common procedures performed. It is used to treat patients with benign unilateral nodules. Hemithyroidectomy results in fewer risks of hypothyroidism and the need for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The present study was designed to identify potential clinicopathologic risk factors associated with the onset of biochemical hypothyroidism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy between 2004 and 2019. Hypothyroidism was defined as a serum thyrotropin level greater than 5 mIU/L. The patients were analyzed for age, sex, preoperative and postoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), state, side, and volume of the remaining lobe, and histologic diagnosis. Results: Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 30.8% of 214 patients. This complication appeared in the first year in 83.3% of the cases. A preoperative TSH level greater than 1.32 mIU/l, a remaining volume of the lobe less than 3 ml, and the presence of thyroiditis were associated with a significant increase in the risk of developing hypothyroidism (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in age, sex, state, and side of the remaining lobe. The mean thyroxine dose was 57 ± 26 micrograms. Conclusions: The risk of hypothyroidism after hemithyroidectomy should be assessed prior to surgery. Close monitoring is recommended in patients at high risk of developing this complication. However, all patients who undergo hemithyroidectomy should be monitored at least for the first year.

                Cashew apples, although widely available and rich in nutrients are still underutilized after harvest in Tanzania. Approximately 2,327,000 metric tonnes of cashew apples are lost each year. Their counterpart, the cashew nut is highly appreciated and successfully contributes to the national economy. The huge underutilization of cashew apples is a challenge that requires urgent attention in order to achieve both national and global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Improvement of the cashew apple sector could have a positive impact on global SDGs 1, 2, and 3 targets of no poverty, zero hunger, and good health and well-being respectively. At national level, this sector could contribute to the goals of the Tanzania Development Vision (TDV) 2025, namely: high quality livelihood, particularly food self-sufficiency and food security; and a strong and competitive economy, particularly a diversified and semi-industrialized economy with a substantial industrial sector comparable to typical middle-income countries. In addition, the country’s Third Five Year Development Plan III (FYDP III) 2021/22 – 2025/26 has established key strategic interventions, notably those related to competitive industrialization, energy, and food and nutrition security to ultimately achieve the goals of the TDV 2025. To be effective, however, these strategic interventions require continued strong central and local government support and active involvement of stakeholders to ensure program effectiveness yielded towards efficient utilization of widely available natural resources such as cashew apples which has cross-cutting benefits in food, agriculture, health, energy, and economic perspectives. Therefore, the work provides evidence on the utilization status, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in Tanzania.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Nigerian youth and their positive attitude towards the national drive against the spread of COVID-19: A cross-sectional online survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has led to the need to prioritise public health campaign by all stakeholders among diverse population groups. This study investigated the dispositions of Nigerian adolescents towards the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.  Methods: The young adolescents (n=1,529) included in this study, were between the ages of 15 and 26 years from Afe Babalola University. Students were contacted through their various colleges and residential hostels to complete the questionnaire via a shared link. All students included, voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study by completing the adapted COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaire. The collected data were analysed to show the level of knowledge, attitude and preventative practices and also to test for significant association between gender and variables for the study. The study was conducted between March 23-April 25, 2021. Results: The outcome of the findings showed that students with families with 5-10 members showed significant association with knowledge accuracy on COVID-19 (χ2 = 6.077, p = 0.044). There was a significant association between gender and the need to report the suspected case of COVID-19 infection to the health authorities (χ2 = 14.075, p = 0.001) with more females likely to report a suspected case. More females (59.2%) were significantly (χ2 = 8.904, p = 0.012) involved in the practice of social distancing or home quarantine as a preventive measure. Conclusions: This study showed evidence of high prevalence of knowledge related to COVID-19 in majority of the study participants. This is a pointer to the efficacy and success of present public health campaigns in Nigeria.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-angiogenic effect of the combination of low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Sorafenib is a standard drug used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but is often resistant and toxic. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin gallate leads to reduced resistance and toxicity but an equally effective anti-angiogenic effect.Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate. Methods:  We conducted an animal study and double-blind, randomized controlled trials. A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7-weeks-old) were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), a combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. Subsequently, liver tissues were examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and microvascular density expression. Results: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in the level of VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However, the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of microvascular density between groups X1 and X2  was not entirely different. Meanwhile, a significant difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared with the control group. Conclusion: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity effects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the effects of therapeutic exercise with either an educational booklet or vitamin-D3 supplement in the management of chronic low back pain: study protocol for an assessor blinded multicenter randomized clinical trial [version 1; peer review:</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is important to know the best intervention approach to replenish serum vitamin D levels along with therapeutic interventions for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. From the researcher’s knowledge, no study compared “vitamin D supplement” or “booklet education on sun exposure, nutrition and lifestyle” with therapeutic exercise for CLBP cases. Researchers hypothesize that multidimensional comprehensive management of therapeutic exercise and an education booklet (TEB) on sun exposure, nutrition, and lifestyle might be superior to therapeutic exercise and oral vitamin D supplement (TED) for CLBP patients with vitamin D deficiency. Methods: We planned for an assessor-blinded two-arm multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) protocol to compare the efficacy of TEB compared to TED for CLBP patients with vitamin D deficiency at 2 months and 6 months after baseline recruitment in designated centers in Dhaka city. The primary outcome measures will include pain by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and serum vitamin D3 level and secondary outcome measures will include disability by Ronald Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Discussion: This study will provide evidence for an appropriate prescription for the management of CLBP patients having vitamin D deficiency.

                Microbes have disproportionate impacts on the macroscopic world. This is in part due to their ability to grow to large populations that collectively secrete massive amounts of secondary metabolites and alter their environment. Yet, the conditions favoring secondary metabolism despite the potential costs for primary metabolism remain unclear. Here we investigated the biosurfactants that the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> makes and secretes to decrease the surface tension of surrounding liquid. Using a combination of genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling we show that the ability to make surfactants from glycerol varies inconsistently across the phylogenetic tree; instead, lineages that lost this ability are also worse at reducing the oxidative stress of primary metabolism on glycerol. Experiments with different carbon sources support a link with oxidative stress that explains the inconsistent distribution across the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> phylogeny and suggests a general principle: <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lineages produce surfactants if they can reduce the oxidative stress produced by primary metabolism and have excess resources, beyond their primary needs, to afford secondary metabolism. These results add a new layer to the regulation of a secondary metabolite unessential for primary metabolism but important to change physical properties of the environments surrounding bacterial populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses can originate from cross-reactive CMV-specific T cells</a></h4>

              
                Detection of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors has been explained by the presence of T cells primed by other coronaviruses. However, based on the relative high frequency and prevalence of cross-reactive T cells, we hypothesized CMV may induce these cross-reactive T cells. Stimulation of pre-pandemic cryo-preserved PBMCs with SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed that frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in CMV-seropositive donors. Characterization of these T cells demonstrated that membrane-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells originate from cross-reactive CMV-specific T cells. Spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide FVSNGTHWF (FVS) and dissimilar CMV pp65 peptide IPSINVHHY (IPS) presented by HLA-B*35:01. These dual IPS/FVS-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were found in multiple donors as well as severe COVID-19 patients and shared a common T cell receptor (TCR), illustrating that IPS/FVS-cross-reactivity is caused by a public TCR. In conclusion, CMV-specific T cells cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, despite low sequence homology between the two viruses, and may contribute to the pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Collateral deletion of the mitochondrial AAA+ ATPase ATAD1 sensitizes cancer cells to proteasome dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The tumor suppressor gene <i>PTEN</i> is the second most commonly deleted gene in cancer. Such deletions often include portions of the chromosome 10q23 locus beyond the bounds of <i>PTEN</i> itself, which frequently disrupts adjacent genes. Coincidental loss of <i>PTEN</i>-adjacent genes might impose vulnerabilities that could either affect patient outcome basally or be exploited therapeutically. Here we describe how the loss of <i>ATAD1</i>, which is adjacent to and frequently co-deleted with <i>PTEN</i>, predisposes cancer cells to apoptosis triggered by proteasome dysfunction and correlates with improved survival in cancer patients. ATAD1 directly and specifically extracts the pro-apoptotic protein BIM from mitochondria to inactivate it. Cultured cells and mouse xenografts lacking ATAD1 are hypersensitive to clinically used proteasome inhibitors, which activate BIM and trigger apoptosis. This work furthers our understanding of mitochondrial protein homeostasis and could lead to new therapeutic options for the hundreds of thousands of cancer patients who have tumors with chromosome 10q23 deletion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">m6A modification of U6 snRNA modulates usage of two major classes of pre-mRNA 5' splice site</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing of messenger RNAs is associated with the evolution of developmentally complex eukaryotes. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, and docking of the pre-mRNA 5' splice site into the spliceosome active site depends upon pairing with the conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA. In some species, including humans, the central adenosine of the ACAGA box is modified by <i>N<sup>6</sup></i> methylation, but the role of this m<sup>6</sup>A modification is poorly understood. Here we show that m<sup>6</sup>A modified U6 snRNA determines the accuracy and efficiency of splicing. We reveal that the conserved methyltransferase, FIO1, is required for Arabidopsis U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Arabidopsis <i>fio1</i> mutants show disrupted patterns of splicing that can be explained by the sequence composition of 5' splice sites and cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection. U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A influences 3' splice site usage. We generalise these findings to reveal two major classes of 5' splice site in diverse eukaryotes, which display anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 snRNA loop 1 and the U6 snRNA ACAGA box. We conclude that U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification contributes to the selection of degenerate 5' splice sites crucial to alternative splicing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SRSF6 balances mitochondrial-driven innate immune outcomes through alternative splicing of BAX</a></h4>

              
                To mount a protective response to infection while preventing hyperinflammation, gene expression in innate immune cells must be tightly regulated. Despite the importance of pre-mRNA splicing in shaping the proteome, its role in balancing immune outcomes remains understudied. Transcriptomic analysis of murine macrophage cell lines identified Serine/Arginine Rich Splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial homeostasis. SRSF6-dependent orchestration of mitochondrial health is directed in large part by alternative splicing of the pro-apoptosis pore-forming protein BAX. Loss of SRSF6 promotes accumulation of BAX-k, a variant that sensitizes macrophages to undergo cell death and triggers upregulation of interferon stimulated genes through cGAS sensing of cytosolic mitochondrial DNA. Upon pathogen sensing, macrophages regulate SRSF6 expression to control the liberation of immunogenic mtDNA and adjust the threshold for entry into programmed cell death. This work defines BAX alternative splicing by SRSF6 as a critical node not only in mitochondrial homeostasis, but also in the macrophage’s response to pathogens.

                The clinical and largely unpredictable heterogeneity of phenotypes in patients with mitochondrial disorders demonstrates the ongoing challenges in the understanding of this semi-autonomous organelle in biology and disease. Previously, we used the gene-breaking transposon to create 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains tagging protein-coding genes (<i>1</i>), including the <i>lrpprc</i> locus. Here we present and characterize a new genetic revertible animal model that recapitulates components of Leigh Syndrome French Canadian Type (LSFC), a mitochondrial disorder that includes diagnostic liver dysfunction. LSFC is caused by allelic variations in the <i>LRPPRC</i> gene, involved in mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation and translation. <i>lrpprc</i> zebrafish homozygous mutants displayed biochemical and mitochondrial phenotypes similar to clinical manifestations observed in patients, including dysfunction in lipid homeostasis. We were able to rescue these phenotypes in the disease model using a liver-specific genetic model therapy, functionally demonstrating a previously under-recognized critical role for the liver in the pathophysiology of this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Measurements of damage and repair of binary health attributes in aging mice and humans reveal that robustness and resilience decrease with age, operate over broad timescales, and are affected differently by interventions</a></h4>

              
                As an organism ages, its health-state is determined by a balance between the processes of damage and repair. Measuring these processes requires longitudinal data. We extract damage and repair transition rates from repeated observations of binary health attributes in mice and humans to explore robustness and resilience, which respectively represent resisting or recovering from damage. We assess differences in robustness and resilience using changes in damage rates and repair rates of binary health attributes. We find a conserved decline with age in robustness and resilience in mice and humans, implying that both contribute to worsening aging health – as assessed by the frailty index (FI). A decline in robustness, however, has a greater effect than a decline in resilience on the accelerated increase of the FI with age, and a greater association with reduced survival. We also find that deficits are damaged and repaired over a wide range of timescales ranging from the shortest measurement scales towards organismal lifetime timescales. We explore the effect of systemic interventions that have been shown to improve health, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and voluntary exercise for mice. We have also explored the correlations with household wealth for humans. We find that these interventions and factors can affect both damage and repair rates, and hence robustness and resilience, in age and sex-dependent manners.

                Cells in the precentral gyrus of the human brain directly send signals to the periphery to generate movement and are topologically organized as a map of the body. We find that movement induced electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes extend this map 3-dimensionally throughout the volume of the gyrus. Unexpectedly, this organization is interrupted by a motor association area in the depths of the central sulcus at its mid-lateral aspect that is active during many different types of movements from both sides of the body.

                Our brain is continuously challenged by daily experiences. Thus, how to avoid systematic erasing of previously encoded memories? While it has been proposed that a dual-learning system with "slow" learning in the cortex and "fast" learning in the hippocampus could protect previous knowledge from interference, this has never been observed in the living organism. Here, we report that increasing plasticity via the viral-induced overexpression of RGS14414 in the prelimbic cortex leads to better one-trial memory, but that this comes at the price of increased interference in semantic-like memory. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings showed that this manipulation also resulted in shorter NonREM-sleep bouts, smaller delta-waves and decreased neuronal firing rates. In contrast, hippocampal-cortical interactions in form of theta coherence during wake and REM-sleep as well as oscillatory coupling during NonREM-sleep were enhanced. Thus, we provide the first experimental evidence for the long-standing and unproven fundamental idea that high thresholds for plasticity in the cortex protects preexisting memories and modulating these thresholds affects both memory encoding and consolidation mechanisms.

                Humans extract information from the key features of the physical word, namely space and time. However, while much is known about the neural processing of visuospatial patterns, there is little information on the hierarchical brain mechanisms underlying conscious recognition of auditory sequences extended over time and their associated prediction errors. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied the brain activity of 83 participants during recognition of original and varied auditory sequences. Results showed a network comprising auditory, ventro-medial prefrontal and inferior temporal cortices, hippocampus, and medial cingulate gyrus underlying sequence processing. The hierarchical pathway from auditory cortex to hippocampus and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex was associated with both originals and variations, but its temporal dynamics crucially differed. Recognition of original versus varied sequences elicited stronger gamma power. Our results complement the knowledge on neural processing of visuospatial patterns by providing the hierarchical brain mechanisms underlying auditory, temporal sequence recognition.

We show ease-of-use and reproducibility of subject conditioning with anatomical T2-weighted imaging for both mice and rats. We also demonstrate application of our design for awake fMRI in mice using both visual evoked potential and olfactory stimulation paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed cradle design can be extended to multiple imaging modalities combining MRI, Positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography.

                Observing others' actions recruits frontoparietal and posterior temporal brain regions - also called the action observation network. It is typically assumed that these regions support recognizing actions of animate entities (e.g., person jumping over a box). However, objects can also participate in events with rich meaning and structure (e.g., ball bouncing over a box). So far, it has not been clarified which brain regions encode information specific to goal-directed actions or more general information that also defines object events. Here, we revealed a shared neural code for visually presented actions and object events throughout the action observation network. We argue that this neural representation captures the structure and physics of events regardless of animacy. We find that lateral occipitotemporal cortex encodes information about events that is also invariant to stimulus modality. Our results shed new light onto the representational profiles of posterior temporal and frontoparietal cortices, and their roles in encoding event information.

                Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector of image Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State fMRI reveals Longitudinal Alterations in Brain Network Connectivity in a Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of the CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. Neuronal degeneration and dysfunction that precedes regional atrophy result in the impairment of striatal and cortical circuits that affect the brain's large-scale network functionality. However, the evolution of these disease-driven, large-scale connectivity alterations is still poorly understood. Here we used resting-state fMRI to investigate functional connectivity changes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease in several relevant brain networks and how they are affected at different ages that follow a disease-like phenotypic progression. Towards this, we used the heterozygous (HET) form of the zQ175DN Huntington's disease mouse model that recapitulates aspects of human disease pathology. Seed- and Region-based analyses were performed at different ages, on 3-, 6-, 10-, and 12-month-old HET and age-matched wild-type mice. Our results demonstrate decreased connectivity starting at 6 months of age, most prominently in regions such as the retrosplenial and cingulate cortices, pertaining to the default mode-like network and auditory and visual cortices, part of the associative cortical network. At 12 months, we observe a shift towards decreased connectivity in regions such as the somatosensory cortices, pertaining to the lateral cortical network, and the caudate putamen, a constituent of the subcortical network. Moreover, we assessed the impact of distinct Huntington's Disease-like pathology of the zQ175DN HET mice on age-dependent connectivity between different brain regions and networks where we demonstrate that connectivity strength follows a nonlinear, inverted U-shape pattern, a well-known phenomenon of development and normal aging. Conversely, the neuropathologically driven alteration of connectivity, especially in the default mode and associative cortical networks, showed diminished age-dependent evolution of functional connectivity. These findings reveal that in this Huntington's disease model, altered connectivity starts with cortical network aberrations which precede striatal connectivity changes, which appear only at a later age. Taken together, these results suggest that the age-dependent cortical network dysfunction seen in rodents could represent a relevant pathological process in Huntington's disease progression.

	<p>The complex structure of the brain supports high-order cognition, which is crucial for mastering chess. Surface-based measures, including the fractional dimension (FD) and gyrification index (GI), may be more sensitive in detecting cortical changes relative to volumetric indexes. For this reason, structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 29 chess experts and 29 novice participants were analyzed using the CAT12 toolbox. FD and GI for each brain region were compared between the groups. A multivariate model was used to identify surface-based brain measures that can predict chess expertise. In chess experts, FD is increased in the left frontal operculum (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and this change correlates with the starting age of chess practice (&amp;amp;rho; = &amp;amp;minus;0.54, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). FD is decreased in the right superior parietal lobule (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Chess expertise is predicted by the FD in a network of fronto-parieto-temporal regions and is associated with GI changes in the middle cingulate gyrus (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and the superior temporal sulcus (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Our findings add to the evidence that chess expertise is based on the complex properties of the brain surface of a network of transmodal association areas important for flexible high-level cognitive functions. Interestingly, these changes are associated with long-lasting practice, suggesting that neuroplastic effects develop over time.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. As acute stroke patients often lose decision-making capacity, acute management is fraught with complicated decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment (LST). We aimed to explore (1) the perspectives and experiences of clinicians regarding the use of predictive scores for LST decision making in severe acute stroke, and (2) clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; awareness of their own cognitive biases in this context. Methods: Four focus groups (FGs) were conducted with 21 physicians (13 residents and 8 attending physicians); two FGs in a university hospital and two in a regional hospital in French-speaking Switzerland. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. Two of the four transcripts were double coded to establish coding framework consistency. Results: Participants reported that predictive tools were not routinely used after severe stroke, although most knew about such scores. Scores were reported as being useful in quantifying prognosis, advancing scientific evidence, and minimizing potential biases in decisions. Their use is, however, limited by the following barriers: perception of inaccuracy, general disbelief in scoring, fear of self-fulfilling prophecy, and preference for clinical judgement. Emotional and cognitive biases were common. Emotional biases distort clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; knowledge and are notably: bias of personal values, negative experience, and cultural bias. Cognitive biases, such as availability, confirmation, and anchoring biases, that produce systematic deviations from rational thinking, were also identified. Conclusions: The results highlight opportunities to improve decision making in severe stroke through the promotion of predictive tools, strategies for communicating prognostic uncertainty, and minimizing cognitive biases among clinicians, in order to promote goal-concordant care.</p>

	<p>Sexualized substance use (SSU) is the practice of psychotropic substance use before or during sex to increase sexual pleasure. The growing use of SSU has a strong association with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Community health mobilizers (CHMs) are agents who assist in decreasing the global burden of disease in the communities they serve. They work as unit managers, counselors, or field workers. The managers and counselors have a minimum of a bachelor&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree, and field workers have a minimum of a higher secondary education. This study aimed to qualitatively assess the knowledge gaps regarding SSU among CHMs. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in New Delhi, India with nineteen CHMs. Majority of the CHMs were men (n = 9, 47%) followed by transgender (TG) persons (TG females n = 5, 26.3%; TG males n = 1, 5.2%), and women (n = 4, 21.1%). Knowledge gaps were identified among the CHMs regarding different types of sexualized substances, drug procurement, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection prevention, and complex health issues associated with SSU. It suggested the need for periodic workshops and training for upgradation of existing knowledge and practices among the CHMs. This formative research may help social scientists to develop protocols for conducting multi-centric, community-based studies across the country for further validation and exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved high-dimensional multivariate autoregressive model estimation of human electrophysiological data using fMRI priors</a></h4>

              
                Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model estimation enables assessment of causal interactions in brain networks. However, accurately estimating MVAR models for high-dimensional electrophysiological recordings is challenging due to the extensive data requirements. Hence, the applicability of MVAR models for study of brain behavior over hundreds of recording sites has been very limited. Prior work has focused on different strategies for selecting a subset of important MVAR coefficients in the model and is motivated by the potential of MVAR models and the data requirements of conventional least-squares estimation algorithms. Here we propose incorporating prior information, such as fMRI, into MVAR model estimation using a weighted group LASSO regularization strategy. The proposed approach is shown to reduce data requirements by a factor of two relative to the recently proposed group LASSO method of Endemann et al. (2022) while resulting in models that are both more parsimonious and have higher fidelity to the ground truth. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using simulation studies of physiologically realistic MVAR models derived from iEEG data. The robustness of the approach to deviations between the conditions under which the prior information and iEEG data is obtained is illustrated using models from data collected in different sleep stages. This approach will allow accurate effective connectivity analyses over short time scales, facilitating investigations of causal interactions in the brain underlying perception and cognition during rapid transitions in behavioral state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability of neural representations in the auditory midbrain across the lifespan despite age-related brainstem delays</a></h4>

              
                The extent to which aging of the central auditory pathway impairs auditory perception in the elderly independent of peripheral cochlear decline is debated. To cause auditory deficits in normal hearing elderly, central aging needs to degrade neural sound representations at some point along the auditory pathway. However, inaccessible to psychophysical methods, the level of the auditory pathway at which aging starts to effectively degrade neural sound representations remains poorly differentiated. Here we tested how potential age-related changes in the auditory brainstem affect the stability of spatiotemporal multiunit complex speech-like sound representations in the auditory midbrain of old normal hearing CBA/J mice. Although brainstem conduction speed slowed down in old mice, the change was limited to the sub-millisecond range and only minimally affected temporal processing in the midbrain (i.e. gaps-in-noise sensitivity). Importantly, besides the small delay, multiunit complex temporal sound representations in the auditory midbrain did not differ between young and old mice. This shows that although small age-related neural effects in simple sound parameters in the lower brainstem may be present in aging they do not effectively deteriorate complex neural population representations at the level of the auditory midbrain when peripheral hearing remains normal. This result challenges the widespread belief of pure central auditory decline as an automatic consequence of aging. However, the stability of midbrain processing in aging emphasizes the role of undetected 'hidden' peripheral damage and accumulating effects in higher cortical auditory-cognitive processing explaining perception deficits in 'normal hearing' elderly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switching state-space modeling of neural signal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Linear parametric state-space models are a ubiquitous tool for analyzing neural time series data, providing a way to characterize the underlying brain dynamics with much greater statistical efficiency than non-parametric data analysis approaches. However, neural time series data are frequently non-stationary, exhibiting rapid changes in dynamics, with transient activity that is often the key feature of interest in the data. Stationary methods can be adapted to time-varying scenarios by employing fixed-duration windows under an assumption of quasi-stationarity. But time-varying dynamics can be explicitly modeled by switching state-space models, i.e., by using a pool of state-space models with different properties selected by a probabilistic switching process. Unfortunately, unlike linear state-space models, exact solutions for state inference and parameter learning with switching state-space models are intractable. Here we derive a solution to the inference problem for a general probabilistic switching state-space framework based on a variational approximation on the joint posterior distribution of the underlying states and the switching process. We then use this state-inference solution within a generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the model parameters of the linear state-space models and the switching process. We perform extensive simulations in different settings to benchmark the performance of our method against existing switching inference methods. We also demonstrate the robustness of our switching inference to characterize dynamics outside the generative switching model class. In addition, we introduce a novel initialization strategy for the expectation step of the generalized EM algorithm using a leave-one-out strategy to compare among candidate models, which significantly improves performance compared to existing switching methods that employ deterministic annealing. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method for the problem of sleep spindle detection, showing how switching state-space models can be used to detect and extract transient spindles from human sleep electroencephalograms in an unsupervised manner.

                In contrast to most transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD), knock-in mice expressing familial AD-linked mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (App) gene exhibit stereotypical age-dependent amyloid beta (A{beta}) pathology and cognitive impairment without physiologically unrealistic App overexpression. This study investigated the effect of familial AD-linked App mutations on hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity and function. To enable calcium imaging of neuronal activity, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APPki) mice were crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s+/- (C-TG) mice to generate AppNL-G-F/NL-G-FxThy1-GCaMP6s+/- (A-TG) mice, which were characterized at 12 months of age. A-TG mice exhibited A{beta} pathology in the hippocampus. In several configurations of an air-induced running task, A-TG mice and C-TG mice were equally successful in learning to run or to stay immobile. In the Morris water place test, A-TG mice were impaired, but learned the task. Comparisons of hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity in the air-induced running task showed that A-TG mice displayed neuronal hypoactivity both during movement and immobility. A-TG mice and C-TG CA1 neuronal encoding of distance or time in the air induced running task were not different. These results suggest that knock-in of familial AD-linked mutations in A-TG mice results in A{beta} pathology, neuronal hypoactivity, and cognitive impairment without severely affecting CA1 neuronal encoding. In comparison to APPki mice, A-TG mice had less severe AD-like memory impairments at 12 months of age (Saito et al., 2014; Mehla et al., 2019), suggesting that the disease onset was delayed in A-TG mice. The effect of APP mutations may have been mitigated through genetic mechanisms when APPKi mice were crossed with C-TG mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterisation and automated quantification of induced seizure-related behaviours in Xenopus laevis tadpoles</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, a clinical diagnosis characterized by paroxysmal episodes known as seizures, affects 1% of people worldwide. An estimated 30% of patients continue to have seizures even on medication, and adverse effects are common. Safe and patient-specific treatment is vital and can be achieved by the development of rapid pre-clinical models of for identified epilepsy genes. Epilepsy can result from either brain injury or gene mutations, and can also be induced chemically. Xenopus laevis tadpoles could be a useful model for confirmation of variants of unknown significance found in epilepsy patients, and for drug re-purposing screens that could eventually lead to benefits for patients. Here, we characterise and quantify seizure-related behaviours in X. laevis tadpoles arrayed in 24-well plates. To provoke acute seizure behaviours, tadpoles were chemically induced with either pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). To test the capacity to adapt this method for drug testing, we also exposed induced tadpoles to the anti-seizure drug valproate (VPA). Four induced seizure-like behaviours were described and manually quantified, and two of these (darting, circling) could be accurately detected automatically, using the video analysis software TopScan. Additionally, we recorded swimming trajectories and mean swimming velocity. Automatic detection showed that either PTZ or 4-AP induced darting behaviour and increased mean swimming velocity compared to untreated controls. Both parameters were significantly reduced in the presence of VPA. In particular, darting behaviour was a shown to be a sensitive measure of epileptic seizure activity. While we could not automatically detect the full range of seizure behaviours, this method shows promise for future studies, since X. laevis is a well-characterised and genetically tractable model organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">THE ROLE OF ALPHA- AND BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS ONCOMPULSION-LIKE ALCOHOL DRINKING</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) is characterized by compulsion-like alcohol drinking (CLAD), and this intake despite negative consequences can be a major clinical obstacle. With the quite limited treatment options available for AUD, there is a significant and critical unmet need for novel therapies. The noradrenergic system is an important hub for the stress response as well as maladaptive drives for alcohol, and pre-clinical (including our own) and clinical studies have shown that drugs targeting the 1 adrenenergic receptors (ARs) may represent a pharmacological treatment for pathological drinking. However, the involvement of {beta} ARs for treating human drinking AUD has received somewhat scant investigation, and we sought to provide pre-clinical validation for possible AR utility for CLAD. Thus, we first examined whether {beta} AR antagonist propranolol, betaxolol ({beta}1), and ICI, 118 551 ({beta}2) impacted compulsion-like intake and alcohol-only drinking (AOD) in male Wistar rats through systemic injections. The systemic highest dose of propranolol (10mg/kg) reduced both AOD and CLAD. 5mg/kg propranolol affected CLAD more than AOD, with no effects of 2.5mg/kg. Similar to propranolol, betaxolol also only decreased CLAD at the lower dose (2.5mg/kg). ICI 118.551 had no effects, suggesting propranolol regulates alcohol intake through {beta}1. Also, while AR compounds might have utility for AUD, these compounds can also lead to undesirable cardiovascular system side effects; thus, any strategy incorporating lower doses of these compounds to reduce drinking could have broad utility. Importantly, here we found that a combination of ineffective doses of 2 propranolol and prazosin administrated together did reduce both CLAD and AOD. Finally, we investigated the effect of propranolol and betaxolol into two brain areas related to pathological drinking, the anterior insula (aINS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Surprisingly, propranolol (1-10g) in aINS or mPFC did not affect CLAD or AOD (although with a trend for aINS betaxolol to impact CLAD), suggesting propranolol regulation of alcohol drinking through a target other than aINS and mPFC. Together, our findings provide new pharmacological insights into noradrenergic regulation of alcohol consumption, which may inform AUD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoscopic patterns of functional connectivity alterations in autism by contrast subgraphs</a></h4>

              
                Despite the breakthrough achievements in understanding structural and functional connectivity alterations that underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the exact nature and type of such alterations are not yet clear due to conflicting reports of hyper-connectivity, hypo-connectivity, and --in some cases-- combinations of both. In this work, we approach the debate about hyper- vs hypo-connectivity in ASD using a novel network comparison technique designed to capture mesoscopic-scale differential structures. In particular, we build on recent algorithmic advances in the sparsification of functional connectivity matrices, in the extraction of contrast subgraphs, and in the computation of statistically significant maximal frequent itemsets, and develop a method to identify mesoscale structural subgraphs that are maximally dense and different in terms of connectivity levels between the different sets of networks. We apply our method to analyse brain networks of typically developed individuals and ASD patients across different developmental phases and find a set of altered cortical-subcortical circuits between healthy subjects and patients affected by ASD. Specifically, our analysis highlights in ASD patients a significantly larger number of functional connections among regions of the occipital cortex and between the left precuneus and the superior parietal gyrus. At the same time, reduced connectivity characterised the superior frontal gyrus and the temporal lobe regions. More importantly, we can simultaneously detect regions of the brain that show hyper and hypo-connectivity in ASD in children and adolescents, recapitulating within a single framework multiple previous separate observations.

	<p>The present review aims to explore the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in the treatment of visual perception in Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) after a stroke. PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Pedro databases were searched, from inception to 1 February 2022. All studies that investigated the effect of IVR on USN, such as outcome in the stroke population, have been included. The current comprehensive systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and was registered in the PROSPERO database [CRD42022311284]. Methodological quality was assessed through JBI critical appraisal tool. A total of 436 articles were identified through the database searches. A total of 10 articles, with a heterogeneous study design, which involved 77 patients with USN with low-to-moderate methodological quality, have been selected. Five out the included studies tested usability of IVR for assessed or treated visual perception deficits in USN, comparing the results with 134 healthy subjects. In the rest of studies that tested IVR such as treatment, three showed statistical positive results (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in visual perception outcome. To date, the literature has suggested the potential benefits in the use of IVR for the treatment of visual perception disorders in USN. Interestingly, IVR motivates patients during the rehabilitation process improving compliance and interest. The heterogeneity in the studies&amp;amp;rsquo; design and in IVR treatments indicate the need of future investigations in the consideration of potentiality and low-cost of this technology.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease aged 75 years and older. Methods: From March 2013 to June 2021, 27 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (&amp;amp;ge;75 years old) who underwent DBS surgery at the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital were selected. The Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale Part 3 (UPDRS-III), 39-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (BI) scores were used to evaluate motor function and quality of life before surgery and during on and off periods of DBS at 1 year post operation and at the final follow-up. A series of non-motor scales were used to evaluate sleep, cognition, and mood, and the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was also assessed. Adverse events related to surgery were noted. Results: The average follow-up time was 55.08 (21&amp;amp;ndash;108) months. Symptoms were significantly improved at 1 year post operation. The median UPDRS-III score decreased from 35 points (baseline) to 19 points (improvement of 45.7%) in the stimulation-on period at 1 year post operation (t = 19.230, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to 32 points (improvement of 8.6%) at the final follow-up (t = 3.456, p = 0.002). In the stimulation-off period, the median score of UPDRS-III increased from 35 points to 39 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;11.4%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.030, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 45 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;28.6%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.207, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The PDQ-39 overall scores decreased from 88 points (baseline) to 55 points (improvement of 37.5%) in the stimulation-on period at 1 year post operation (t = 11.390, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 81 points (improvement of 8.0%) at the final follow-up (t = 2.142, p = 0.044). In the stimulation-off period, the median PDQ-39 score increased from 88 points to 99 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;12.5%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.801, p = 0.005). The ADL-Barthel Index score increased from 25 points (baseline) to 75 points (improvement of 66.7%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.205, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to 35 points (improvement of 28.6%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.034, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the stimulation-off period, BI scores decreased from 25 points to 15 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;40%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.225, p = 0.01) and to 15 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;40%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.959, p = 0.001). Sleep, cognition, and mood were slightly improved at 1 year post operation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and LEDD was reduced from 650 mg (baseline) to 280 mg and 325 mg at 1 year post operation and the final follow-up, respectively (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). One patient had a cortical hemorrhage in the puncture tract on day 2 after surgery, five patients had hallucinations in the acute stage after surgery, and one patient had an exposed left-brain electrode lead at 4 months post operation; there were no infections or death. Conclusion: DBS showed efficacy and safety in treating older patients (&amp;amp;ge;75 years old) with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Motor function, quality of life, activities of daily living, LEDD, and sleep all showed long-term improvements with DBS; short-term improvements in emotional and cognitive function were also noted.</p>

	<p>Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) seropositive for autoantibodies against nodal and paranodal proteins display distinct clinical presentations. In the latest study, CIDP with autoantibodies against paranodal proteins was defined as autoimmune nodopathy (AN). We herein present a case of 39-year-old male with anti- neurofascin (NF) 155 and NF186 IgG4 antibody with gait disturbance and tremor, who was followed up for 4 months and demonstrated clinical improvements after apparently effective rituximab therapy. In addition, a literature review was conducted to investigate the clinical characteristics of anti-NF155/NF186-positive AN.</p>

	<p>Previous research reported significant relationship between Big Five personality traits and aggression in both adolescent&amp;amp;rsquo;s and adult population. However, it is unclear about whether similar connection exist in early age. This study investigated how personality traits and family environment influence the development of aggression in school aged Saudi children. A sample of 315 school going children were recruited voluntarily to complete a set of measures examining Big Five personality factors, family environment and aggression. Correlation analysis were employed to evaluate association between Big Five personality traits, family environment and aggression. The results showed a significant relationship of Big Five personality factors and family environment factors to aggression. The findings of the study revealed that amongst the Big Five personality traits conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism were strongest antecedents of childhood aggression. Family environment characterized by family cohesion, expressiveness and conflict were appeared to be significant antecedents of aggressive behavior in children. This study expands our knowledge about the intervention strategies of aggression from Big Five traits and family environment perspectives.</p>

	<p>The aim of this review is to draw attention to neurosurgical approaches for treating chronic and opioid-resistant pain. In a first chapter, an up-to-date overview of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of pain has been carried out, with special emphasis on the details in which the surgical treatment is based. In a second part, the principal indications and results of different surgical approaches are reviewed. Cordotomy, Myelotomy, DREZ lesions, Trigeminal Nucleotomy, Mesencephalotomy, and Cingulotomy are revisited. Ablative procedures have a limited role in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, but they continues to help patients with refractory cancer-related pain. Another ablation lesion has been named and excluded, due to lack of current relevance. Peripheral Nerve, Spine Cord, and the principal possibilities of Deep Brain and Motor Cortex Stimulation are also revisited. Regarding electrical neuromodulation, patient selection remains a challenge.</p>

	<p>Events linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) influence psychological and physical health through the generation, exacerbation, and maintenance of symptoms such as anxiety, hyperarousal, and avoidance. Depending upon circumstance, traumatic events may also contribute to the onset of tinnitus, post-traumatic headache, and memory problems. PTSD should be considered a psychological injury, andwhile tinnitus is a symptom, its onset and sound quality may be connected in memory to the injury, thereby evincingthe capacity to exacerbate the trauma&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects. The myriad attributes, psychological and mechanistic, shared by tinnitus and PTSD offer tinnitus investigators the opportunity to draw from the rich and long-practiced strategies implemented for trauma counseling. Mechanisms and interventions understood through the lens of traumatic exposures may inform the clinical management of tinnitus disorder, and future studies may assess the effect of PTSD intervention on co-occurring conditions. This brief summary considered literature from both the hearing and trauma disciplines, with the goal of reviewing mechanisms shared between tinnitus and PTSD, as well as clinical reports supporting mutual reinforcement of both their symptoms and the effects of therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A managed care system with telemedicine support for neurological emergencies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is frequently used to provide remote neurological expertise for acute stroke workup and was associated with better functional outcomes when combined with a stroke unit system-of-care. We investigated whether such system-of-care yields additional benefits when implemented on top of neurological competence already available onsite.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Quality improvement measures were implemented within a "hub-and-spoke" teleneurology network in 11 hospitals already provided with onsite or telestroke expertise. Measures included dedicated units for neurological emergencies, standardization of procedures, multiprofessional training, and quality-of-care monitoring. Intervention effects were investigated in a controlled study enrolling patients insured at three participating statutory health insurances diagnosed with acute stroke or other neurological emergencies. Outcomes during the intervention period between November 2017 and February 2020 were compared with those pre-intervention between October 2014 and March 2017. To control for temporal trends, we compared outcomes of patients with respective diagnoses in 11 hospitals of the same region. Primary outcome was the composite of up-to-90-day death, new disability with the need of ambulatory or nursing home care, expressed by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,418 patients post-implementation (55% female, mean age 76.7±12.8y) and 2,306 patients pre-implementation (56%, 75.8±13.0y, respectively). The primary outcome occurred in 479/1,418 (33.8%) patients post-implementation and in 829/2,306 (35.9%) pre-implementation. Adjusted HR for the primary outcome was 0.89 (95%-CI: 0.79–0.99, p=0.04) with no improvement seen in non-participating hospitals between post- versus pre-implementation periods (aHR 1.04; 95%-CI: 0.95–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of a multicomponent system-of-care was associated with a lower risk of poor outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Dimethyl fumarate delays multiple sclerosis in radiologically isolated syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) represents the earliest detectable pre-clinical phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the impact of therapeutic intervention in preventing first symptom manifestation at this stage in the disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving people with RIS. Individuals without clinical symptoms typical of MS but with incidental brain MRI anomalies consistent with CNS demyelination were included. Within 12 MS centers in the U.S., participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 240mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was the time to onset of clinical symptoms attributable to a CNS demyelinating event within a follow-up period of 96 weeks. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied to all participating individuals in the primary and safety investigations. The study is registered at <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, NCT02739542 (ARISE).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants from 12 centers were recruited from March 9, 2016 to October 31, 2019 with 44 people randomized to dimethyl fumarate and 43 to placebo. Following DMF treatment, the risk of a first clinical demyelinating event during the 96-week study period was highly reduced in the unadjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression model (hazard ratio (HR)=0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.05-0.63, p=0.007). More moderate adverse reactions were present in the DMF (34 (32%)) than placebo groups (19 (21%)) but severe events were similar (DMF, 3 (5%); placebo, 4 (9%)).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first randomized clinical trial demonstrating the benefit of a disease-modifying therapy in preventing a first acute clinical event in people with RIS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific transcriptomic profiling of reward and sensory brain areas in perinatal fentanyl exposed juvenile mice</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl increased ~300% in the last decade, including among women of reproductive ages. Adverse neonatal outcomes and long-term behavioral disruptions are associated with perinatal opioid exposure. Our previous work demonstrated that perinatal fentanyl exposed (PFE) mice displayed enhanced negative affect and somatosensory circuit and behavioral disruptions during adolescence. However, little is known about molecular adaptations across brain regions that underlie these outcomes. We performed RNA-sequencing across three reward and two sensory brain areas to study transcriptional programs in PFE juvenile mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 pregnant dams received 10ug/ml fentanyl in the drinking water from embryonic day 0 (E0) through gestational periods until weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). RNA was extracted from nucleus accumbens (NAc), prelimbic cortex (PrL), ventral tegmental area (VTA), somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventrobasal thalamus (VBT) from PFE mice of both sexes at P35. RNA-sequencing was performed, followed by analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene co-expression networks. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed sex-specific DEGs and gene modules significantly associated with PFE. The VTA had the most DEGs, while pronounced gene enrichment occurred in NAc. Genes enriched in mitochondrial respiration were pronounced in NAc and VTA of PFE males, extracellular matrix (ECM) and neuronal migration enrichment were pronounced in NAc and VTA of PFE males, while genes associated with vesicular cycling and synaptic signaling were markedly altered in NAc of PFE female mice. In sensory areas from PFE females, we found alterations in mitochondrial respiration, synaptic and ciliary organization processes. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate sex-specific neuroadaptations in PFE mice. Our studies identify distinct transcriptomes across reward and sensory brain regions that may underlie disrupted behavioral and circuit states in PFE mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interferon-gamma Elicits Pathological Hallmarks of ALS in Human Motor Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is an established factor contributing to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, implicating the possible detrimental effects of inflammatory cytokines to motor neurons. The RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 has emerged as a pivotal actor in ALS, because TDP-43 mutations cause familial ALS and loss of nuclear TDP-43, associated with its redistribution into cytoplasmic aggregates (TDP-43 proteinopathy), in motor neurons occurs in 97% of ALS cases. However, mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to TDP-43 mis-localization have not been described. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune-modulatory protein, highly expressed on cell surfaces following acute inflammatory stress. To determine which inflammatory cytokines might impact motor neuron function, seven cytokines known to be elevated in ALS patients' cerebrospinal fluid were tested for their effects on PD-L1 expression in human iPSC-derived motor neurons. Among the tested cytokines, only interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was found to strongly promote PD-L1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that excessive exposure to IFN-gamma may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. We observed that neuronal populations exposed to IFN-gamma exhibited severe TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation and excitotoxic behavior correlated with impaired neural firing activity, hallmarks of ALS pathology, in both normal and ALS mutant (TARDBPQ331K+/-) neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed possible mechanisms for these effects. Motor neurons exposed to IFN-gamma exhibited an extensive shift of their gene expression profile toward a neurodegenerative phenotype. Notably, IFN-gamma treatment induced aberrant expression levels for 70 genes that are listed in the recent literature as being dysregulated in ALS. Additionally, we found that genes related to neuronal electrophysiology, protein aggregation, and TDP-43 mis-regulation were abnormally expressed in IFN-gamma-treated cells. Moreover, IFN-gamma induced a significant reduction in the expression of genes that encode indispensable proteins for neuromuscular synapse development and maintenance, implying that cytokine exposure could directly impair signal transmission between motor axons and muscle membranes. Our findings suggest that IFN-gamma could be a potent upstream pathogenic driver of ALS and provide potential candidates for future therapeutic targets to treat sporadic forms of ALS, which account for roughly 90% of reported cases.

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Methods: AIS patients were enrolled in two centers. The serum samples were collected within the first 24 h after admission, and HMGB1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of SAP for HMGB1 concentrations. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were performed to explore the shapes of the association between HMGB1 concentrations and SAP. Results: From January 2022 to May 2022, a total of 420 AIS patients were enrolled. Ninety-six (22.9%) patients develop SAP. The levels of HMGB1 in the SAP group were higher than those in the non-SAP group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Using the first quartile of HMGB1 group as a reference, patients in the fourth quartile of HMGB1 group had the highest likelihood of experiencing SAP in the unadjusted model (OR = 3.687; 95% CI: 1.851&amp;amp;ndash;7.344), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 3.511; 95% CI: 1.725&amp;amp;ndash;7.147), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 2.701; 95% CI: 1.045&amp;amp;ndash;6.981). HMGB1 was also independently associated with SAP as a continuous variable in the unadjusted model (OR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.069&amp;amp;ndash;1.199), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 1.131; 95% CI: 1.066&amp;amp;ndash;1.200), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.096; 95% CI: 1.011&amp;amp;ndash;1.188). RCS showed a linear association between HMGB1 and SAP (p for linear trend = 0.008) Conclusions: HMGB1 might be able to act as a potential biomarker of SAP in AIS patients.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.</p>

	<p>Engaging in musical activities throughout the lifespan may protect against age-related cognitive decline and modify structural and functional connectivity in the brain. Prior research suggests that musical experience modulates brain regions that integrate different modalities of sensory information, such as the insula. Most of this research has been performed in individuals classified as professional musicians; however, general musical experiences across the lifespan may also confer beneficial effects on brain health in older adults. The current study investigated whether general musical experience, characterized using the Goldsmith Music Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), was associated with functional connectivity in older adults (age = 65.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.4, n = 69). We tested whether Gold-MSI was associated with individual differences in the functional connectivity of three a priori hypothesis-defined seed regions in the insula (i.e., dorsal anterior, ventral anterior, and posterior insula). We found that older adults with more musical experience showed greater functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior insula and the precentral and postcentral gyrus, and between the ventral anterior insula and diverse brain regions, including the insula and prefrontal cortex, and decreased functional connectivity between the ventral anterior insula and thalamus (voxel p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01, cluster FWE p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Follow-up correlation analyses showed that the singing ability subscale score was key in driving the association between functional connectivity differences and musical experience. Overall, our findings suggest that musical experience, even among non-professional musicians, is related to functional brain reorganization in older adults.</p>

	<p>The Zero-P spacer was primarily developed aiming to reduce the morbidity associated with the traditional anterior cervical plate. During the past decade, many authors have reported the use of Zero-P spacers for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) of one or two segments. Nevertheless, there is still a paucity of knowledge on the safety and feasibility of using Zero-P spacers for 3-level fixation. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes, with a focus on the sagittal alignment reconstruction of 3-level ACDF surgery using Zero-P spacers versus those using a traditional plate and cage system. From Sep 2013 to Aug 2016, a total of 44 patients who received 3-level ACDF surgery due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy were recruited. The Zero-P spacer was used in 23 patients (group ZP) and the traditional plate and cage system in 21 (group PC). Clinical outcomes were analyzed by Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores, and dysphagia was evaluated using the Bazaz score. Radiological outcomes, including fusion rate, adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), and especially changes in cervical sagittal alignment, were analyzed. The NDI and JOA scores did not differ significantly between the two groups postoperatively (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05); however, there was significantly less dysphagia in patients using Zero-P spacers at the 3- and 6-month follow-up (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, the fusion rate and ASD were similar between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Interestingly, patients using Zero-P spacers had a significantly lower postoperative C2-7 Cobb angle and fused segment Cobb angle, compared to those using a traditional plate and cage system (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); meanwhile, the fused segment disc wedge was also found to be significantly smaller in patients using Zero-P spacers after surgery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, we further divided patients into subgroups according to their cervical lordosis. In patients with a preoperative C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;le; 10&amp;amp;deg;, significantly less cervical and local lordosis, as well as disc wedge, were seen in group ZP after surgery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while in others with a preoperative C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;gt; 10&amp;amp;deg;, no significant difference in postoperative changes of the cervical sagittal alignment was seen between group ZP and group PC (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Zero-P spacers used in 3-level ACDF surgery could provide equivalent clinical outcomes and a lower rate of postoperative dysphagia, compared to the traditional plate and cage system. However, our results showed that it was inferior to the cervical plate in terms of sagittal alignment reconstruction for 3-level fixation. We recommend applying Zero-P spacers for 3-level ACDF in patients with good preoperative cervical lordosis (C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;gt; 10&amp;amp;deg;), in order to restore and maintain physiological curvature of the cervical spine postoperatively.</p>

	<p>Recreational drug intake may be associated with a range of medical untoward consequences, including male infertility. However, as the related evidence is still limited, the main outcome of this review is to provide a better understanding of the existence of any association between recreational drug misuse and male fertility levels&amp;amp;rsquo; decline. Whilst searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding male infertility and substances of abuse (e.g., phytocannabinoids, opiates/opioids, stimulants, &amp;amp;lsquo;herbal highs&amp;amp;rsquo;, psychedelics, and &amp;amp;lsquo;novel psychoactive substances) was here undertaken. Due to the paucity of robust, high-quality, empirical, human studies, a narrative strategy was here preferred over a systematic approach. Relevant data are qualitatively analyzed and presented in a table. Although most available evidence is in support of a detrimental role of cannabis on human spermatogenesis, a few remaining studies failed to document any effect of this drug on seminal quality, and it is not clear to which extent this drug impacts fertility rates/time to pregnancy. The current understanding of the impact of opiate-, cocaine- and amphetamine/stimulant-misuse on human reproduction is widely unknown, and most studies dealing with this matter represent only an extrapolation of data derived from specific clinical circumstances. Although the message of &amp;amp;lsquo;no smoking, no alcohol and no street drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; should always be offered as good health advice to all patients seeking medical help for fertility issues, robust scientific clinical evidence in support of a direct detrimental impact of recreational drugs on spermatogenesis is scant to date.</p>

	<p>Inhibition of reaching and grasping actions as an element of cognitive control and executive function is a vital component of sensorimotor behaviour that is often impaired in patients who have lost sensorimotor function following a stroke. To date, there are few kinematic studies detailing the fine spatial and temporal upper limb movements associated with the millisecond temporal trajectory of correct and incorrect responses to visually driven Go/No-Go reaching and grasping tasks. Therefore, we aimed to refine the behavioural measurement of correct and incorrect inhibitory motor responses in a Go/No-Go task for future quantification and personalized rehabilitation in older populations and those with acquired motor disorders, such as stroke. An exploratory study mapping the kinematic profiles of hand movements in neurotypical participants utilizing such a task was conducted using high-speed biological motion capture cameras, revealing both within and between subject differences in a sample of healthy participants. These kinematic profiles and differences are discussed in the context of better assessment of sensorimotor function impairment in stroke survivors.</p>

	<p>Neuroprostheses are neuroengineering devices that have an interface with the nervous system and supplement or substitute functionality in people with disabilities. In the collective imagination, neuroprostheses are mostly used to restore sensory or motor capabilities, but in recent years, new devices directly acting at the brain level have been proposed. In order to design the next-generation of neuroprosthetic devices for brain repair, we foresee the increasing exploitation of closed-loop systems enabled with neuromorphic elements due to their intrinsic energy efficiency, their capability to perform real-time data processing, and of mimicking neurobiological computation for an improved synergy between the technological and biological counterparts. In this manuscript, after providing definitions of key concepts, we reviewed the first exploitation of a real-time hardware neuromorphic prosthesis to restore the bidirectional communication between two neuronal populations in vitro. Starting from that &amp;amp;lsquo;case-study&amp;amp;rsquo;, we provide perspectives on the technological improvements for real-time interfacing and processing of neural signals and their potential usage for novel in vitro and in vivo experimental designs. The development of innovative neuroprosthetics for translational purposes is also presented and discussed. In our understanding, the pursuit of neuromorphic-based closed-loop neuroprostheses may spur the development of novel powerful technologies, such as &amp;amp;lsquo;brain-prostheses&amp;amp;rsquo;, capable of rewiring and/or substituting the injured nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">BDNF as a potential predictive biomarker for patients with pediatric cerebral palsy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in children, which is instigated by damage to the developing brain that affects the ability to control the muscles. The main types of CP are spastic CP, dyskinesia CP and mixed CP. The aim of this work was to estimate the concentrations of complete blood count (CBC), erythrocytic sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in children with CP compared to the control group. Methods: A total of 75 Egyptian children were enrolled in this study, 45 had CP and 30 were controls. CBC, ESR, CRP, BDNF, and TNF-α were assessed. Results: The ESR, CRP and TNF-α levels showed statistically significant increases in cases compared with controls. While the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and the BDNF levels were significantly lower in CP compared with the controls. When comparing the different groups of CP with each other; there were no significant differences. Regarding the correlation of BDNF and different studied parameters, our study showed a positive correlation between BDNF and TNF levels only within the group with spastic CP. Conclusions: BDNF may be considered as a biomarker or treatment target for CP to avoid further complications as still there is insufficient progress in the prediction, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CP. Furthermore, searching for novel strategies to increase BDNF levels may open a new opportunity for the treatment of CP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stage 1 Registered Report: Refinement of tickling protocols to improve positive animal welfare in laboratory rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Rat tickling is a heterospecific interaction for experimenters to mimic the interactions of rat play, where they produce 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USV), symptoms of positive affect; tickling can improve laboratory rat welfare. The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A scoping review protocol on diagnostic and treatment costs of cardiovascular disease management in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in India. Economic threats due to CVDs have surged, as diagnostic and treatment costs are out-of-pocket expenses. The increasing prevalence of CVDs in India is due to globalization, industrialization, aging, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet, and sleep patterns. This scoping review provides a summary of the costs incurred in diagnosing and treating CVDs in India. Methods: The JBI updated methodology aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will guide this scoping review. Searches will be conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Econ Papers, and ProQuest databases. Google Scholar and Shodhganga will be used to search for relevant gray literature. Bibliographic mining will be performed to identify additional relevant studies. The literature published from 2000 onwards will be the primary focus. All direct and indirect costs for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs across various levels of healthcare settings will be included. A two-stage independent screening, consisting of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, will be conducted to identify eligible articles. Data will be extracted from full-text studies using a customized data extraction form. The results will be compiled and presented in the scoping review performed. Ethics and dissemination: A conference presentation and scientific peer-reviewed journal publication will be the sources for disseminating the review results. This study does not require an ethics review because publicly available sources were used to retrieve data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multiple institutions’ research findings using the National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mesothelioma remains an under-researched cancerous disease due to the lack of high-quality patient samples and clinical information especially outcomes and asbestos exposure data. The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) is a biobank in which mesothelioma annotated biospecimens can be made widely available to the research community. Here, we summarized the significant research findings from 20 publications that utilized the NMVB samples for novel biomarker and therapeutic discoveries. The results showed that the use of the NMVB resource was dispersed among a variety of basic science topics including, but not limited to, biomarkers, abnormal gene expression, and potential therapeutic targets. Positive biomarkers included several miRNAs and antibodies, HMGB1, ATG5, PIAS3, pancytokeratin and GATA3. Genes that had mutations or high/low levels of expression were BAP1, a human control gene of importance in this disease, as well as various cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors TM4SF1, PKM2, ARHGDIA, COBLL1, WT1, FOXM1, and CD30. Treatments investigated include thiostrepton, interferon-�� gene, and Brentuximab. Publications reviewed indicated a significant impact of the NMVB resource utilized in significant studies focusing on biomarker and therapeutic discoveries, which can act as a model for rare diseases, especially in oncology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Invasive micropapillary ductal breast carcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is a rare variant of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), with most cases characterized by lymph node metastasis and lymphatic vascular invasion. It is a ductal breast cancer subtype with a very high risk of recurrence and therefore requires special attention from breast cancer physicians and radiologists. Case: We present a case of an IMPC that has been followed up for two years since diagnosis and management. Based on clinical breast examination, ultrasound, and mammography, the initial diagnosis was a suspicious mass that required further investigation. Radiological and histological findings informed the diagnosis of a highly suspicious lesion, which turned out to be IMPC. The patient underwent surgery, left mastectomy with nodal dissection. During the 24-month follow-up, ultrasound and mammography revealed no evidence of local recurrence or involvement of the contralateral breast. Conclusions: This case reveals that invasive micropapillary carcinoma is a distinct but poorly recognized variant and subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Operant conditioning of stochastic chemical reaction networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Arredondo, Matthew R. Lakin</p>

Adapting one’s behavior to environmental conditions and past experience is a key trait of living systems. In the biological world, there is evidence for adaptive behaviors such as learning even in naturally occurring, non-neural, single-celled organisms. In the bioengineered world, advances in synthetic cell engineering and biorobotics have created the possibility of implementing lifelike systems engineered from the bottom up. This will require the development of programmable control circuitry for such biomimetic systems that is capable of realizing such non-trivial and adaptive behavior, including modification of subsequent behavior in response to environmental feedback. To this end, we report the design of novel stochastic chemical reaction networks capable of probabilistic decision-making in response to stimuli. We show that a simple chemical reaction network motif can be tuned to produce arbitrary decision probabilities when choosing between two or more responses to a stimulus signal. We further show that simple feedback mechanisms from the environment can modify these probabilities over time, enabling the system to adapt its behavior dynamically in response to positive or negative reinforcement based on its decisions. This system thus acts as a form of operant conditioning of the chemical circuit, in the sense that feedback provided based on decisions taken by the circuit form the basis of the learning process. Our work thus demonstrates that simple chemical systems can be used to implement lifelike behavior in engineered biomimetic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sleep prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks by forming a joint synaptic weight representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan Golden, Jean Erik Delanois, Pavel Sanda, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Artificial neural networks overwrite previously learned tasks when trained sequentially, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new training is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. Here we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on different tasks. In synaptic weight space, new task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old task leading to forgetting. Interleaving new task training with periods of off-line reactivation, mimicking biological sleep, mitigated catastrophic forgetting by constraining the network synaptic weight state to the  previously learned manifold, while allowing the weight configuration to converge towards the intersection of the manifolds representing old and new tasks. The study reveals a possible strategy of synaptic weights dynamics the brain applies during sleep to prevent forgetting and optimize learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveal novel pathways of resistance to combinations of cephalosporin antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Augusto Dulanto Chiang, Prashant P. Patil, Lidia Beka, Jung-Ho Youn, Adrien Launay, Robert A. Bonomo, Pavel P. Khil, John P. Dekker</p>

Hypermutation due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Whether hypermutators generate resistance through predominantly similar molecular mechanisms to wild-type (WT) strains is not fully understood. Here, we show that MMR-deficient <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> can evolve resistance to important broad-spectrum cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics through novel mechanisms not commonly observed in WT lineages. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and transcriptional profiling of isolates that underwent in vitro adaptation to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), we characterized the detailed sequence of mutational and transcriptional changes underlying the development of resistance. Surprisingly, MMR-deficient lineages rapidly developed high-level resistance (>256 μg/mL) largely without corresponding fixed mutations or transcriptional changes in well-established resistance genes. Further investigation revealed that these isolates had paradoxically generated an early inactivating mutation in the <i>mexB</i> gene of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, a primary mediator of CZA resistance in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, potentially driving an evolutionary search for alternative resistance mechanisms. In addition to alterations in a number of genes not known to be associated with resistance, 2 mutations were observed in the operon encoding the RND efflux pump MexVW. These mutations resulted in a 4- to 6-fold increase in resistance to ceftazidime, CZA, cefepime, and ceftolozane-tazobactam when engineered into a WT strain, demonstrating a potentially important and previously unappreciated mechanism of resistance to these antibiotics in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>. Our results suggest that MMR-deficient isolates may rapidly evolve novel resistance mechanisms, sometimes with complex dynamics that reflect gene inactivation that occurs with hypermutation. The apparent ease with which hypermutators may switch to alternative resistance mechanisms for which antibiotics have not been developed may carry important clinical implications.

     alt="Recessive NUP54 Variants Underlie Early-Onset Dystonia with Striatal Lesions"/>
<p>Genetic studies of individuals with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes identified unrelated patients with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>, a gene not previously associated with monogenic diseases; the patients displayed shared features of early-onset dystonia with striatal signal-changes and variable neurodevelopmental comorbidities. All variants disrupted conserved amino-acids in the C-terminal protein–protein interaction domain of NUP54, involved in structural stabilization of parts of the nuclear-pore complex. Protein-modeling and patient fibroblast-based studies indicated partial loss of protein function as the most likely mechanism of pathogenicity.

<br/>
<p>Infantile striatonigral degeneration is caused by a homozygous variant of the nuclear-pore complex (NPC) gene <i>NUP62</i>, involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By querying sequencing-datasets of patients with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes, we identified 3 unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>. All variants clustered in the C-terminal protein region that interacts with NUP62. Associated phenotypes were similar to those of <i>NUP62</i>-related disease, including early-onset dystonia with dysphagia, choreoathetosis, and T2-hyperintense lesions in striatum. In silico and protein-biochemical studies gave further evidence for the argument that the variants were pathogenic. We expand the spectrum of NPC component-associated dystonic conditions with localized basal-ganglia abnormalities. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
