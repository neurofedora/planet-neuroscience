              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1252/v2?src=rss">Physics-Informed Neural Networks without Loss Balancing: A Direct Term Scaling Approach for Nonlinear 1D Problems [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. Unlike existing approaches that modify the loss function during training, the proposed framework operates directly at the level of the governing equations, prior to loss construction. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-115/v1?src=rss">Effects of Methandienone on the ovaries of rabbits in relation to the aromatase gene (CYP19A1) and oxidative markers and the possible protective role of selenium [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), such as methandienone, are synthetic testosterone derivatives that are widely used for the enhancement of physical performance and the growth of muscles. This study looked at the effect of methandienone on ovarian CYP19A1 gene expression and oxidative status in rabbits. The work also examined whether supplementation with selenium could reduce the adverse effects caused by methandienone. Methods Twenty healthy adult female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups and maintained under uniform management for 30 days. The groups included a control, a methandienone-treated group (T1), a selenium group (T2), and a combined methandienone plus selenium group (T3). Serum oestrogens concentrations were measured using standard biochemical techniques. CYP19A1 mRNA expression in ovarian tissue and markers were quantified by established molecular and biochemical protocols. Results Rabbits receiving methandienone alone (T1) showed a significant decline (P≤0.05) in CYP19A1 mRNA expression and serum oestrogens when compared with the control and other treatment groups. Selenium supplementation (T2) produced marked increases in both parameters relative to G1 and G3, indicating a robust corrective effect. Oxidative stress analysis revealed elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) in the T1 group, consistent with increased oxidative stress. Intermediate oxidative stress values were observed in the T3 group, exceeding those in the T1 group but remaining below those in the T2 group. Conclusion Methandienone appears to impair ovarian function by suppressing CYP19A1gene expression and promoting oxidative stress, leading to reduced steroidogenic activity. Selenium administration mitigates these disturbances by enhancing antioxidant defense and partially restoring gene expression and oestrogens levels. These findings highlight the potential of selenium as a supportive intervention against methandienone -induced oxidative and hormonal disruptions in rabbits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-114/v1?src=rss">SARS-CoV-2 Infection Impacts Liver-Related Blood Tests Following Infection: A Health Administrative Data Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection is novel and widespread globally, causing a range of illness severity. The impacts on the liver from SARS-CoV-2 are variable and appear unpredictable. Objective In the weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver-related blood tests are abnormal in patterns different than in matched controls without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This was a retrospective study of health administrative data of individuals in Ontario, Canada between January 2020 and September 2022. Cases were individuals with their first positive COVID-19 test with at least one liver-related blood test (AST, ALT, albumin, INR, bilirubin) available in the following 28 days. Two control individuals (with a negative COVID-19 test) were age/sex matched to each case. Any patients with a diagnostic code indicting pre-existing liver disease, or a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding six months were excluded. Machine learning analysis approaches included logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and neutral network models. Results 100,574 cases and 200,709 matched controls were included. 49% (49,299) had at least one abnormal liver test in 28 days following positive COVID-19 test. Of the controls, 41% (82,495) had at least one abnormal liver test in the 28 days following negative COVID-19 test. The optimal machine learning model used XGBoost for adult cases, with an area under the curve of 0.74. Conclusions Further studies could use this approach to create monitoring systems to use abnormalities like liver enzyme changes, at a population level, as a bellwether for not only COVID-19 outbreaks, but also other hepatotropic illness epidemics, and pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-113/v1?src=rss">Experiences of Indonesian Christian Religious Education Teachers in Implementing the Independent Curriculum in Sen-ior High Schools: A Phenomenological Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study explores the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. The independent curriculum in Indonesia was developed as a more adaptive curriculum framework as part of the learning reform initiative, focusing on essential materials and the development of students’ character and skills. The government explains that the main characteristics of this curriculum that support learning recovery are project-based learning, which develops soft skills and character. Methods This study employs a qualitative phenomenological approach to examine how Christian religious education teachers engage with the independent curriculum. Given that the research questions focused on the subjective experiences of Christian religious education teachers, data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with four selected participants, chosen based on the study’s objectives and a purposive sampling approach in North Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia. Results The study revealed that teachers encountered several challenges, including IT skills gaps, differences in understanding the concept of independent curriculum, and the scarcity of relevant materials for Christian education. Teachers need help adapting to the limitations of old learning methods and the special training and mentoring required to implement the new technology system of the independent curriculum. However, there are initiatives from teachers to collaborate, add materials, and learn from the teacher community to improve their competence. Therefore, this study ultimately offers a new perspective on understanding a phenomenon, namely, the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. Conclusion This study emphasizes the importance of more comprehensive support from the government and schools to enhance the effectiveness of implementing the independent curriculum, especially in Christian religious education. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and education practitioners to support the effective and sustainable implementation of the independent curriculum.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-112/v1?src=rss">Experimental study For improving sandy soil against uplift capacity by Emulsion Asphalt for Anchor plate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of anchors fixed in sandy soil is currently pioneering, especially in fixing the sides of excavations or marine structures, and even in engineering structures exposed to lateral loads. Therefore, there is a need to use improvements to develop the bearing capacity of anchors, whether single or group, or even if their burial depth is shallow or deep, as is the case with other engineering structures. Method A physical model was used in this experimental research to study the behavior of anchors individually and collectively in sandy soil and how to change the critical depth of burial from shallow depth to deep depth individually and collectively with anchors in addition to the upward bearing capacity in the soil without improvement and also using electronic measuring devices to measure the vertical displacement, and then using bituminous emulsion and recording the values of the uplift bearing capacity of the anchors and comparing them with natural soil. Results In this paper model tests were carried out by using single and line groups square anchor plates (1x2), (1x3), (1x4) & (1x5) in sandy soil with (30) different embedded ratio (H/D) test to understand the behavior of the anchor plate in sandy soils depending upon on the transition from shallow to deep anchor, also to obtain the transitional depth by which the anchor acts as a shallow or deep while in loading state. Depending on the tests the critical depth in the line group ranges from (5D) to (6D), while using a single anchor the critical depth is approximately more than (5D). The other (10) tests were carried out for improving the soil around the anchor by emulsion asphalt at depth (2D) & (6D) shallow and deep respectively. The optimum ratio of the emulsion asphalt was from (4-6)% by direct shear and unconfined pressure tests. The ultimate capacity was improved at high ratio for shallow single anchor than deep single anchor. The use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period resulted in an increase in the uplift capacity of both the individual anchors and the group. On the other hand, the uplift capacity of the anchor was increased with the use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period. Furthermore, the uplift capacity of the individual anchor was lower than that of the group of anchors, while the improvement in the shallow anchors resulted in a higher increase in uplift capacity than the deep anchors. Conclusions After conducting laboratory experiments on sandy soil with anchors installed in it and at different depths, it was found that there is a critical depth for the anchors at which the depth moves from shallow to deep. Also, the improvement with bituminous emulsion led to an increase in the load-bearing capacity of the anchors when lifting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-111/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Relationship Between Decreased Sound Tolerance and Neural Attention Processing: An ERP Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined how attentional control resources influence DST. Previous studies have shown that increasing cognitive load enhances the brain activity component (N100) to task-irrelevant noise. We hypothesized that individuals with DST would be more sensitive to cognitive load, showing a greater increase in their neural responses to noise as cognitive load increases. Because DST comprises multiple subjective symptoms, we analyzed the associations with specific symptoms. Methods Thirteen adults with ASD and twenty-two adults without ASD participated in the study. Participants who self-reported auditory hypersensitivity were classified as the DST group. All participants completed a DST questionnaire with six subscales: excessive loudness, ear pain, fear, annoyance, attention control, and attention to detail. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by task-irrelevant noise were analyzed during an auditory n-back task. The n-back task included a low (1-back) and a high (2-back) cognitive load condition. Results The prevalence of self-reported DST was significantly higher in the ASD group than in controls. Individuals who reported DST also tended to experience other types of sensory hypersensitivity. Attentional functions were associated with fear, annoyance, and loudness perception of sounds, and ear pain appeared to function independently of other DST symptoms. Scores for attentional control difficulties related to DST did not correlate with performance on the n-back task, which reflects susceptibility to noise interference. Contrary to previous findings, N100 amplitude did not differ between task-load conditions and did not vary according to the presence of DST. P200 amplitude was larger in the 1-back than in the 2-back condition but did not differ by ASD diagnosis or DST status. Conclusions The presence of DST or ASD was not associated with cognitive capacity or with the auditory processing of task-irrelevant noise.

                <p>Episodic timing refers to the one-shot, automatic encoding of temporal information in the brain, in the absence of attention to time. A previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study showed that the relative burst time of spontaneous alpha oscillations (&alpha;) during quiet wakefulness was a selective predictor of retrospective duration estimation. This observation was interpreted as &alpha; embodying the "ticks" of an internal contextual clock. Herein, we replicate and extend these findings using electroencephalography (EEG), assess robustness to time-on-task effects, and test the generalizability in virtual reality (VR) environments. In three EEG experiments, 128 participants of either sex underwent 4&nbsp;min eyes-open resting-state recordings followed by an unexpected retrospective duration estimation task. Experiment 1 tested participants before any tasks, Experiment 2 after 90&nbsp;min of timing tasks, and Experiment 3 in VR environments of different sizes. We successfully replicated the original MEG findings in Experiment 1 but did not in Experiment 2. We explain the lack of replication through time-on-task effects (changes in &alpha; power and topography) and contextual changes yielding a cognitive strategy based on temporal expectation (supported by a fast passage of time). In Experiment 3, we did not find the expected duration underestimation in VR and did not replicate the correlation between &alpha; bursts and retrospective time estimates. Overall, while EEG captures the &alpha; burst marker of episodic timing, its reliability depends critically on experimental context. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling experimental context when using &alpha; bursts as a neural marker of episodic timing.</p>

                With increasing concern about the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central focus of scientific research. To better understand how this field has evolved, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify publication trends, key themes, and emerging topics. The analysis was based on data from Scopus and Web of Science and examined the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Methods included keyword co-occurrence analysis, assessments of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis. In addition, a Cartesian framework was used to classify key terms according to their relevance and recency. The results show an exponential growth in scientific output, with notable increases in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, reaching a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were identified, with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were the most productive, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst had the greatest impact on the field. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a transition from early research focused on “soil erosion” to more recent themes such as “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network identified seven thematic clusters, with the most prominent cluster centered on “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain.” Emerging topics included “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector.” Overall, the study demonstrates a clear evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, underscoring the importance of emerging topics and international collaboration. It also proposes a multidisciplinary research agenda that prioritizes food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, and emphasizes the integration of innovative technologies to address current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Ruminal impaction is a serious digestive disorder in sheep, leading to systemic metabolic acidosis and, as a consequence, widespread physiological disturbances. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative parameters in a local Iraqi sheep that was suffering from ruminal impaction. Methods A case control study was performed in 20 adult female sheep (Awassi sheep breeder) (10 ruminal impaction and 10 control) diagnosed with in Fallujah, Iraq, based on clinical signs and confirmed by laboratory findings of hyperkalaemia. The control group consisted of sheep of age, sex and weight consistent with clinically normal sheep. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers using established laboratory methods. Results The impacted animals showed significant increases (P≤0.05) in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), glucose, urea, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate and significant decreases (P≤0.05) in albumin, cholesterol, sodium, chloride, and calcium levels, where serum level of magnesium did not show any significant difference between the groups. In addition, oxidative stress was present as there was a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Background These findings indicate a pathogenesis cascade whereby ingestion of poorly digested food causes ruminal stasis, systemic acidosis, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, oxidative stress and oxidative stress. Using a single biomarker may underestimate the true severity of the disease, while combining biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative measurements provides a more complete picture.

                Microalgae are increasingly recognized as sustainable green cell factories capable of producing a various high-value bioactive compounds. Among them, the red microalga Porphyridium purpureum stands out for its unique ability to secrete sulfated exopolysaccharides (sEPS)—complex macromolecules enriched with sulfate and uronic acid groups that exhibit potent biological activities. These compounds function as natural antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobial agents, attracting substantial interest from the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and functional food industries. A targeted literature search was conducted across the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases to identify studies focusing on the extraction, structural characterization, and applications of sulfated exopolysaccharides from Porphyridium purpureum between 2015 and 2025. Recent research has demonstrated rapid advancements in environmentally friendly extraction technologies, including membrane filtration, three-phase partitioning (TPP), ultrasound-assisted TPP (UATPP), and deep eutectic solvents (DES), which collectively enhance the yield, purity, and preserve the biological functionality of sEPS. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in structural and mechanistic elucidation through advanced analytical and imaging techniques such as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, methylation analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. These approaches have clarified how cultivation parameters and environmental stressors influence EPS biosynthesis, sulfation patterns, and biological activity. Overall, this review provides an integrated and forward-looking perspective on the scientific advances and technological challenges surrounding P. purpureum sEPS, outlining future directions toward sustainable bioprocessing and industrial valorization of these high-value biomacromolecules.

                <p>by Tengfei Ji, Bo Yang, Meng Wang, Hong Ji, Huazhe Yang, Yizhuo Liu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics enables the measurement of gene expression in intact tissues. Despite this, reconstructing anatomically accurate spatial domains remains challenging, primarily due to expression sparsity, complex tissue architecture that is characterized by sharp boundaries and long-range continuity, and weak spatial signals. Traditional pipelines typically rely on expression-driven clustering and spatial smoothing, which underperform at boundaries and in sparse regions while neglecting morphological information. To address these challenges, AugGCL is proposed, an augmented graph-convolutional learning framework that enhances spatial structure decoding and gene expression reconstruction through targeted augmentation of both gene and image data. A key component of AugGCL is neighborhood information aggregation mechanism, which integrates expression similarity and spatial proximity to construct a weighted graph and an enhanced expression matrix, addressing sparsity without sacrificing boundary clarity. Additionally, a two stream weighted graph convolutional network jointly models refined gene features and image-derived morphological information, with image-aware auxiliary reconstructions enhancing weak spatial signals and sharpening boundaries. On datasets from the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer, and mouse embryo, AugGCL outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, showing robustness and generalization across a range of datasets. Downstream analysis validated the reliability of the method, confirming its effectiveness in cell annotation, functional enrichment, and mechanistic studies. AugGCL generates clearer spatial domains and significantly advances the application of spatial transcriptomics in tissue structure and disease research.

                <p>by Haneol Cho, Junho Lee, Sean Lawler, Yangjin Kim</p>

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with the very poor survival and high recurrence rate. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a pivotal role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a new mathematical model of the critical GBM-TAN interaction in the heterogeneous brain tissue. The model reveals that the dual and complex role of TANs (either anti-tumorigenic N1 and the pro-tumorigenic N2 type) regulates the phenotypic trajectory of the evolution of tumor growth and the invasive patterns in white and gray matter via mediators such as IFN-<i>β</i> and TGF-<i>β</i>. We investigated the effect of normalizing the immune environment on glioma growth by applying a therapeutic antibody and developed several strategies for eradication of tumor cells by neutrophil-mediated transport of nanoparticles. We also developed a strategy of combination therapy (surgery + Trojan neutrophils) for effective control of the infiltration of the glioma cells in one hemisphere before crossing the corpus callosum (CC) in order to prevent recurrence in the other hemisphere. This alternative approach compared to the extended resection of the glioma including CC or butterfly GBM may provide the greater anti-tumor efficacy and reduce side effects such as cognitive impairment.

                <p>by Daniel Shani, Peter Dayan</p>

Egocentric representations of the environment have historically been relegated to being used only for simple forms of spatial behaviour such as stimulus-response learning. However, in the many cases that critical aspects of policies are best defined relative to the self, egocentric representations can be advantageous. Furthermore, there is evidence that forms of egocentric representation might exist in the wider hippocampal formation. Nevertheless, egocentric representations have yet to be fully incorporated as a component of modern navigational methods. Here we investigate egocentric successor representations (SRs) and their combination with allocentric representations. We build a reinforcement learning agent that combines an egocentric SR with a conventional allocentric SR to navigate complex 2D environments. We demonstrate that the agent learns generalisable egocentric and allocentric value functions which, even when only additively composed, allow it to learn policies efficiently and to adapt to new environments quickly. Our work shows the benefit for egocentric relational structure to be captured, as well as allocentric. We offer a new perspective on how cognitive maps could usefully be composed from multiple simple maps representing associations between state features defined in different reference frames.

                <p>by Lucas J. Restrepo, Jasmine K. Graslie, Tina M. Fortier, Eric H. Baehrecke</p>

The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cell health. Mutations in genes that are required for mitophagy, including <i>Vps13D</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>Parkin</i>, are associated with movement disorders, but gaps exist in our understanding of how Vps13D regulates mitophagy. Here, we identify Mtch (MTCH2 in humans) as a regulator of mitophagy based on a relationship with Vps13D during developmentally programmed mitophagy in <i>Drosophila</i> intestine enterocyte cells. Similar to <i>Vps13D</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> mutant cells fail to clear mitochondria and possess elevated markers of autophagy. Genetic and molecular experiments reveal that Mtch and Vps13D function in a mitophagy pathway with PINK1, Parkin, and the mitophagy receptor BNIP3. Unlike <i>Vps13D</i> and <i>Parkin</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> is required for proper expression of the tail-anchored protein BNIP3. Thus, the tail-anchored protein insertase function of Mtch/MTCH2 likely explains how these proteins possess multiple cell context-specific functions.

                <p>by Yanhua Zhao, Meiting Zhang, Yan You, Jinrong Zhang, Yuning Ji, Lei Lei</p>

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable tool in regenerative medicine, yet its efficiency remains limited by epigenetic reprogramming barriers that have been partially corrected by global regulation of epigenetic enzymes. However, these approaches lack gene locus specificity and may disrupt normal gene regulation. Therefore, new strategies capable of broadly enhancing reprogramming fidelity are needed. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the pioneer transcription factor Nr5a2 in mouse SCNT embryos improves both zygotic genome activation and the morula-to-blastocyst transition, two major developmental barriers in SCNT, and enhances birth rates. Mechanistically, Nr5a2 recruits P300 to increase H3K27ac at genes with low expression, restoring transcriptional activity and promoting SCNT embryo development.

                <p>by Dinh Nhan Lai, Xi Yang, Chong Xie, Ting Li, An Yan, Xing Liu, Yun Zhou</p>

Land plants alternate between generations of asexual sporophytes and sexual gametophytes. Unlike seed plants, ferns produce free-living gametophytes that grow independently from their sporophytes. Gametophytes of the model fern <i>Ceratopteris</i> exist in two sex types: hermaphrodites and males. Hermaphrodites maintain meristems and secrete the pheromone antheridiogen, inducing undecided gametophytes to become males. In the absence of antheridiogen, males exhibit developmental plasticity and dynamic cell fate specification by initiating de novo meristems to convert into hermaphrodites. Despite its essential role, the molecular signals governing this process remain unclear. Here, we show that local auxin biosynthesis, dynamically regulated during sex-type conversion, establishes new auxin maxima that are critical for specifying and promoting the proliferation of the meristem progenitor cell (MPC) lineage, ultimately enabling the de novo formation of a multicellular meristem from a single MPC. Time-lapse imaging revealed that upon antheridiogen removal, auxin signaling is specifically activated at the initial site of proliferation in <i>Ceratopteris</i> males, triggering new meristem formation. This auxin signaling subsequently becomes concentrated at the center of the proliferating meristem, aligning with localized auxin biosynthesis and the emergence of the meristem notch. Computationally reconstrued lineage maps further showed that chemical inhibition of CrTAA1 abolishes these dynamic auxin patterns, blocking MPC lineage initiation and its subsequent proliferation. Furthermore, genetic knockout of <i>CrTAA1</i> via CRISPR-Cas9 phenocopies the effects of chemical inhibition, preventing new meristem formation and disrupting male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. Together, these findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying sex-type conversion in land plants and highlight the pivotal role of de novo auxin biosynthesis in orchestrating cell fate and proliferation during meristem formation.

                Background The effectiveness of information systems in enhancing user performance is influenced by various factors, including system quality, service quality, and user satisfaction. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has been proposed as a moderator in this relationship, though its impact remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the moderating role of POS on the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, specifically in the context of Approweb, an information system used by account representatives at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) in Jakarta. Methods A quantitative research approach with an explanatory design was adopted to examine causal relationships among the variables. The theoretical framework was based on the DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (2003), with POS incorporated from the socio-technical perspective. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey from 329 Account Representatives (ARs) using a probability sampling method Results The study found that both system quality and service quality significantly influence user satisfaction and user performance. Moreover, POS was found to significantly moderate the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, enhancing the positive effects of both quality dimensions on performance. These results suggest that organizational support is a key factor in maximizing the benefits of information systems. Conclusions The findings confirm the critical role of system quality, service quality, and POS in improving user performance. POS was shown to amplify the positive effects of both system and service quality, indicating that users are more likely to perform effectively when they perceive strong organizational support. The study contributes to the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model by incorporating POS as a moderating factor and emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to system success that integrates both technical and social dimensions.

                Background Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their Blood Glucose (BG) to continually control their glycemia. They had to undergo a blood test at least twice a day using a finger prick, and must visit a laboratory every three months for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the constitution of Iraqi diabetes patients is 13.9%. An Internet of Things (IoT) based framework for non-invasive BG monitoring was recently developed. The aim is to enhance the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device by using IoT technologies. Methods Starting with a review of the latest IoT technologies and some of the CGM commercial devices recommended by ISO 15197 standard. A questionnaire sheet is distributed to determine how much patients in Iraq knew about their health situation and whether they are interested in using new IoT technologies. Women patients are volunteered to check their BG using both finger prick and a CGM device three times a day for comparing. The suggestion is to connect CGM to a personal smart device that has a method controlling alarm messages instead of CGM output. Results The results show how important to educate patients about new technologies. A CGM and finger prick results are checked for similarity using statistical package. Results are presented as (mean ± SD (standard deviation)), the findings demonstrated that, significantly at P < 0.05, there were no differences between the means for tests in both methods based on the standard Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report. Conclusion This study shows how Iraqi’s patients feel when using a CGM device with new IoT technologies. CGM output is accurate but appeared every 15 min which may be uncomfortable. A method is suggested to transfer CGM output to a smart device to be controlled by algorithms, so that an alarm message is showed every 8h in a normal situation rather than every 15 min. Moreover, GMI% can be calculated every two weeks using data stored in the cloud to estimate a patient’s HbA1c level by using Markov chain. This figure how BG levels are changing in a shorter timeframe, helping in fine-tune diabetes management plans.

                Abstract* Background Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in mathematics education has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, reflecting broader advances in machine learning, learning analytics, and generative AI. However, a comprehensive overview of publication trends, thematic structures, and collaborative patterns specific to mathematics education remains limited. Methods This study employed a bibliometric approach guided by the PRISMA protocol to systematically analyze research on AI and ITS in mathematics education published between 2001 and 2025. A total of 237 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers indexed in Scopus were identified, screened, and included. Bibliographic data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package to examine annual publication growth, author productivity, international collaboration networks, and thematic evolution through keyword co-occurrence and thematic mapping techniques. Results The findings indicate that research output grew slowly during the early 2000s but increased markedly after 2019, aligning with the global surge in interest in machine learning, large language models, and generative AI. Author productivity followed a typical long-tail distribution, with a small group of core authors contributing consistently over time. International collaboration was evident but uneven, dominated by a limited number of countries. Thematic analysis revealed two enduring pillars of the field: pedagogical approaches in mathematics education and technology-driven instructional systems. Emerging themes, including federated learning and adversarial machine learning, point to rising attention to privacy, security, and robustness in adaptive learning environments. STEM education and generative AI have also gained prominence in recent years. Conclusions The evolution of research on AI and ITS in mathematics education reflects a clear paradigm shift from traditional instruction toward adaptive, data-driven, and intelligent learning systems. While technological innovation continues to accelerate, the findings highlight the critical role of teachers’ pedagogical readiness in ensuring that AI-enhanced mathematics education remains effective, inclusive, and sustainable.

                This study investigated the relationship between parents perceptions of children’s values in Indonesian families, focusing on economic, social, emotional, and religious dimensions. The investigation was based on background factors, such as gender, location of residence, and education level, as well as correlations and regressions between dimensions of children’s values. The study participants consisted of 255 parents living in various urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Data were collected using the Children’s Values Scale adapted for the Indonesian context. The study findings showed that there were no significant differences in children’s perceptions of values based on gender or education level. However, there were significant differences based on location of residence, especially on economic and religious dimensions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between social and emotional dimensions, while a negative relationship was found between economic and emotional dimensions in some contexts. The results of multiple linear regression analysis using the Stepwise method showed that economic and religious dimensions had a significant impact on overall family relationship patterns. This study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence parents’ perceptions of children’s values to support effective and harmonious parenting in Indonesian families.

                Vold et al. studied two SNAP-25 variants with different clinical severity. Variants destabilize the SNARE complex and reduce binding to the Munc18-1:VAMP2:syntaxin-1 acceptor complex, with correlated effects on neurotransmitter release. Effects of co-expression of variant and wild-type SNAP-25 were modeled by assuming the co-existence of both species in a ring of SNARE complexes.

They further show that Brs3-expressing PVH neurons regulate satiety, as they co-express Mc4r, cause weight gain when silenced, and reduce food intake via parabrachial projections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105214">Computational modelling identifies key determinants of subregion-specific dopamine dynamics in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Striatal dopamine (DA) release regulates reward-related learning and motivation and is believed to consist of a short-lived <i>phasic</i> and continuous <i>tonic</i> component. Here, we build a large-scale three-dimensional model of extracellular DA dynamics in dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS). The model predicts rapid dynamics in DS with little to no basal DA and slower dynamics in the VS enabling build-up of <i>tonic</i> DA levels. These regional differences do not reflect release-related phenomena but rather differential dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. Interestingly, our simulations posit DAT nanoclustering as a possible regulator of this activity. Receptor binding simulations show that D1 receptor occupancy follows extracellular DA concentration with milliseconds delay, while D2 receptors do not respond to brief pauses in firing but rather integrate DA signal over seconds. Summarised, our model distills recent experimental observations into a computational framework that challenges prevailing paradigms of striatal DA signalling.

                Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated in the acute phase of HIV infection (AHI) results in a smaller viral reservoir. However, the impact of early HIV-specific T-cell responses on long-term reservoir dynamics is less well characterized. Therefore, we measured the size of the viral reservoir and functionality of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses after the acute phase at 24 and 156 weeks after ART initiation in people with HIV who started treatment during AHI. A significant reduction in total and defective HIV DNA and a trend toward a reduction in intact HIV DNA were observed between 24 and 156 weeks. Functional CD8+ T-cell responses against HIV peptides Env, Gag, Nef, and Pol were maintained over 3 years after treatment initiation. The proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells at 24 weeks of ART was predictive of the degree of reduction in total and defective HIV DNA between 24 and 156 weeks, suggesting HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells may at least partially drive the decline of the viral reservoir. Therefore, enforcing HIV-specific immune responses as early as possible after diagnosis of AHI should be a central focus of HIV cure strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104528">Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and, in turn, their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap, proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help account for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106931">Doubling dolutegravir dosage reduces the viral reservoir in ART-treated people with HIV</a></h4>

              
                Whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) is always completely suppressive, or HIV might continue to replicate at low levels despite ART in some people with HIV (PWH), is still debated. Here, we intensified the ART regimen by doubling dolutegravir (DTG) dosage and investigated the impact of this strategy on HIV blood and tissue reservoirs, immune activation, and inflammation. Twenty HIV-infected adults, who had received a triple ART consisting of 50 mg DTG/600 mg abacavir/300 mg lamivudine pre-intensification and had been suppressed on ART for at least 2 years, were enrolled in a phase 2 randomized clinical trial (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a> identifier: NCT05351684). Half of them received an additional 50 mg of DTG for a period of 84 days. As expected, plasma and tissue DTG concentrations significantly increased during the study period in the intensified group but not in the control group. Accordingly, significant decreases in total HIV DNA, intact HIV DNA, and cell-associated unspliced (US) HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as in the US RNA/total DNA ratio, were observed in the intensified group but not in the control group. Intensification also modestly reduced markers of immune activation and exhaustion but had no measurable impact on systemic or tissue inflammation. Together with this, intensification resulted in a temporary decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio that returned to baseline by day 84. Our results strongly suggest that the pre-intensification ART regimen was not completely suppressive. If confirmed in larger clinical trials, these results could have an impact on the clinical management of PWH and HIV curative strategies.

">Towards a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Improving Phonological Processing in Developmental Dyslexia: An Exploratory Study</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have immense potential regarding the provision of therapies for disorders of development, but to date have typically been created for non-linguistic disorders such as ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Here we present a BCI that aims to improve linguistic phonological processing in developmental dyslexia. Phonological 'deficits' are considered a core feature of dyslexia across languages. A non-invasive EEG-BCI relying on auditory inputs and visual feedback was developed to optimise brain patterns related to phonology (speech-sound processing). These patterns were identified using Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, which proposes that phonological difficulties in dyslexia are related to impaired auditory processing of amplitude envelope rise times and low-frequency speech envelope information <10 Hz. These impairments are thought to affect automatic features of speech processing from birth, impairing the development of a phonological system. Adults with and without a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia played the BCI for 16 sessions, and received pre- and post-testing regarding phonological awareness and single word and nonword reading skills. Significant associations between their BCI scores (a measure of BCI learning) and improvements in syllable stress discrimination, nonword reading and amplitude rise time discrimination were found. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.

">Large-scale brain network differences during deliberate and spontaneous mind-wandering in a sustained attention task: An electroencephalography source-level connectivity study</a></h4>

              
                Mind-wandering (MW), the shift of attention away from an ongoing task, can be classified as either deliberate or spontaneous, depending on whether these internal thoughts arise intentionally or unintentionally. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging-based resting state studies have shown that spontaneous MW traits are positively correlated with coupling within the default mode network (DMN), whereas deliberate MW traits are positively correlated with coupling both within the DMN and between the DMN and control- or attention-related networks. However, state-based functional connectivity during each MW episode remains unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigated how deliberate and spontaneous MW differentially involve state-based large-scale network interactions during a sustained attention task using electroencephalography (EEG), which captures rapid network dynamics. Thirty-one participants performed the gradual-onset continuous performance task using 64-channel EEG. Mental states were classified via experience-sampling probes as on-task, deliberate, or spontaneous MW. EEG data from 1-s pre-probe epochs were analyzed using source estimation and the weighted phase lag index to assess functional connectivity within and across the DMN, control network (CN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Relative to both spontaneous MW and the on-task state, deliberate MW was characterized by significantly stronger alpha band functional connectivity. A prominent connectivity cluster was centered on the right frontal operculum-insula of the SN, linking regions across the SN, CN, and DMN. In addition, deliberate MW exhibited enhanced SN-DAN-DMN coupling compared with the on-task state. By contrast, spontaneous MW did not show significant connectivity differences relative to the on-task state in any frequency band. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha band network interactions centered on the SN may contribute to the intentional regulation of internally directed thought during deliberate MW.

">Neural Measures of Human Decision Making Track Evidence Accumulation in Learned Space</a></h4>

              
                Neural decision-making flexibly integrates evidence across sensory, mnemonic, and semantic domains. Yet all prior demonstrations involve evidence that is either directly available in stimuli or retrieved from established representations. A fundamental question remains: does neural evidence accumulation extend to decisions based on evidence that must be computed through learned representational transformations? Here we show it does. We recorded scalp EEG while participants classified continuously-oriented visual stimuli into discrete categories defined by an experimenter-imposed boundary. Category-level evidence was operationalized as category coherence, or the angular distance between each stimulus and the learned boundary. We predicted that if neural decision mechanisms are truly domain-general, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), a scalp EEG potential indexing evidence accumulation, should scale with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP sensitivity should correlate with computational drift rates. Both predictions were supported: CPP slopes increased monotonically with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP slopes correlated with individual differences in drift rates across participants. These findings reveal that the brain's decision machinery treats evidence identically regardless of its representational origin - whether externally available, pre-existing, or computed through learned transformations.

">Neonatal brain-age models in full- and preterm infants</a></h4>

              
                Prematurity affects brain development and increases risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Yet reliable biomarkers for at-risk infants remain limited. The goals of this study are (1a) to construct a white matter neonatal brain-age model including full-term and preterm neonates from a large publicly-available data set, (1b) to evaluate the accuracy of this model for characterizing the preterm brain from the same data set; (2) to determine if a similar model can predict brain-age based on clinical MRI scans from high-risk neonates born preterm; and (3) to evaluate whether this predictive model provides information about the infant's health beyond conventional clinical and demographic measures. We developed brain-age prediction models using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived white matter features from two datasets: (1) the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP; 368 healthy infants) and (2) a clinical sample collected at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH; 162 high-risk preterm infants). White matter features demonstrated strong predictive performance in the dHCP dataset (within 3.9 days) and the LPCH clinical dataset (within 6.6 days). However, brain-age metrics (i.e., brain-age gap) showed no significant associations with health complications measured by a composite score of common prematurity complications. While tractometry-derived brain-age models accurately characterize brain maturation in the neonatal brain, their sensitivity to clinical complications in preterm infants appears limited. Global white matter maturation measures derived from clinical grade data may be insufficiently sensitive to capture the cumulative burden of prematurity-related morbidities, suggesting need for multimodal or longitudinal biomarkers.

">Resting-state and task-related neurometabolite levels differentially relate to cortical excitability in the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background. Normal brain function requires a dynamic balance between inhibition and excitation. While magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantifies the chief inhibitory and excitatory neurometabolites, GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx), the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a complementary measure of cortical inhibition-excitation dynamics via transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs). However, the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs is unclear. Objective. To characterize the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs, as a function of TEP component, TMS pulse type, brain region, neurometabolite, and MRS brain state. Methods. Twenty-five young healthy adults completed a 4-day protocol. Sessions 1 and 2 involved screening, anatomical MRI, and functional MRI localization of DLPFC. In session 3, single- and paired-pulse TMS-EEG were applied over SM1 and DLPFC. Session 4 included resting-state and motor-task-related MRS of SM1 and DLPFC. Results. In SM1, task-related GABAergic tone strongly predicted early to mid-latency TEPs. In DLPFC, local early to mid-latency TEPs showed no relationship to neurometabolites, whereas late and global TEP outcomes revealed some links. The later N100 TEP was the only component consistently modulated by paired-pulse TMS. Task-related MRS measures consistently outperformed resting-state measures in predicting TEPs for SM1, while the opposite was true for DLPFC. Conclusions. Single-pulse TEPs reliably index the local inhibitory tone in SM1, with limited added value from paired-pulse paradigms. These findings support the use of single-pulse TEPs as accessible markers of cortical inhibition, especially for SM1, and may inform biomarkers and strategies for individualized neuromodulation.

">Long-Term Expression and Safety of AAV1-Mediated PI3Kδ Overexpression in the Adult Rat Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mature CNS neurons are incapable of sufficiently regenerating their axons following spinal cord injury (SCI). This is largely due to developmental changes in epigenetic control leading to suppression of axon growth transcriptomic profile, leading to a shift towards synapse function support. Recently, manipulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through PI3K{delta} overexpression in cortical neurons enhanced axonal regeneration of corticospinal tract axons, which was accompanied by functional recovery monitored for up to 16 weeks. However, PI3K is more widely known for its role as an oncogene, and since overexpression is achieved by the use of AAVs, valid safety concerns are raised as it is unknown what the long-term consequences of sustained PI3K{delta} expression in the brain are, which may be necessary to achieve complete re-establishment of the motor pathway. In this study, AAV1-hSYN-PIK3CD was injected into the motor cortex of rats, which survived for 1 year. Comparison with uninjected control animals reveal stable PI3K{delta} expression and sustained pathway activation through increased pS6. PI3K{delta}-treated animals show absence of tumour formation, neural soma hypertrophy, glial cell activation, or haematological or biochemical abnormalities. Thus, long-term neuronal PI3K{delta} expression appears to be well tolerated and may provide a safe and durable strategy to promote functional repair following SCI.

">Biophysically realistic network-level transport model of tau progression with exosome-mediated release and uptake processes</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's follows the brain's structural connectome, yet a profound gap exists between the slow macroscopic spread observed over years and the rapid protein kinetics occurring over hours. Current graph-diffusion models fail to reconcile this timescale disparity or incorporate the cellular mechanisms driving transmission. Here, we advance the Network Transport Model (NTM) to bridge these scales by integrating directional active transport along microtubules, continuous toxic tau production, and exosome-mediated trans-neuronal release and uptake. This framework constitutes one of the most mechanistically complete and biologically detailed models of tau spread on the whole brain to date, representing a significant innovation in how multiscale proteinopathies are simulated. To overcome the computational complexity of the underlying partial differential equations, we developed a quasi-static approximation that separates fast axonal transport from slow network-wide exchange. Simulations on the whole-brain mouse connectome demonstrate that this framework emergently replicates empirical tau propagation patterns without the need for case-specific empirical fitting. Our results identify trans-neuronal release and uptake rates as the primary mechanistic "bottleneck" on macroscopic spread, providing a biologically grounded explanation for the disease's slow progression. Furthermore, we find that high aggregation rates can paradoxically sequester tau within neurons, limiting global transmission, while transport polarity (anterograde vs. retrograde) fundamentally dictates spatial patterning. By linking molecular mechanics to system-wide pathology, this model provides a predictive "in-silico" framework to evaluate how cellular-targeted interventions might alter the trajectory of tauopathic dementias.

">Data quality biases normative models derived from fetal brain MRI</a></h4>

              
                Normative modeling is increasingly used to characterize typical growth trajectories and identify atypical neurodevelopment, including early brain development using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired before birth. Recent work has emphasized the importance of large sample sizes for accurate and robust centile estimation. In this study, we investigate how image quality influences fetal brain normative models, a critical factor in this context where MRI is acquired on a moving fetus in utero. Using a multi-centric cohort of 635 fetal MRI scans, we applied a standardized visual quality control (QC) protocol with continuous quality ratings. We fit normative models for multiple brain structures under progressively relaxed QC stringency, and quantified the deviations in centile estimates relative to a high-quality reference subgroup. Our results showed that including lower-quality data systematically biased normative centiles, with the strongest effects observed in the outer centiles, particularly the lower tail (1st-10th). Bias increased progressively as QC stringency was relaxed and could not be attributed solely to the number of subjects used to fit the models. Quality-induced bias was structure-dependent, and often not visually apparent at the segmentation level. These findings highlight that image quality is an important source of bias in normative fetal brain modeling, and that increasing sample size at the expense of quality may systematically affect centile estimates, potentially jeopardizing the utility of the model.

">The loss of Tau in the adult brain triggers neuroplastic, epigenetic and behavioral deficits</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Accumulation of pathological Tau precipitates neuronal malfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the impact of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain, independently of Tau aggregates, remains unclarified. METHODS: We used a mouse model with conditional mapt knocking-down in forebrain of 5-7 months old animals (cTau-KO), a virus-driven selective Tau knockdown in wild-types (WT) and Tau re-expression approaches, accompanied by neurostructural, epigenetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral analyses. RESULTS: Loss of Tau in the adult brain of cTau-KOs triggers neuronal atrophy and malfunction, epigenetic as well cognitive and mood deficits. Importantly, these perturbations were confirmed by selective Tau loss in WT adult brain and reverted by Tau re-expression or pharmacologically-induced epigenetic correction in cTau-KOs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the contribution of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain malfunction that could be relevant in diverse brain pathologies beyond AD, associated to Tau and its dysfunction.

">Beyond the Focus of Expansion: Retinal curl as a functional signal for heading estimation</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing models aiming at explaining heading assume that humans need to recover the Focus of Expansion (FOE) while filtering out rotational flow (curl) caused by eye movements. We propose an alternative: the visual system utilizes retinal curl directly to estimate heading, rendering the explicit recovery of the FOE unnecessary. Stationary participants viewed simulated walking paths on a large screen while fixating on ground targets at varying eccentricities -a natural behavior inducing sustained retinal curl. Participants continuously reported perceived heading. To isolate the role of rotational flow, we employed a real-time manipulation that kept translational flow constant while the foveal curl component was either intact, cancelled, or overcancelled. Under natural conditions, participants exhibited systematic heading biases opposite the direction of gaze. Crucially, these biases vanished in the 'cancelled curl' condition, identifying retinal curl as the specific driver of perceptual bias. We modeled these results using a simple feedback controller and a ring-attractor neural network featuring gaze-contingent inhibition and a 'straight-ahead' prior. These findings suggest the brain exploits the geometry of gaze stabilization to simplify navigation, treating retinal curl as a functional signal rather than noise to be filtered.

">Impaired development of the medial olivocochlear system in a KCNQ4-deficient mouse model.</a></h4>

              
                The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system modulates outer hair cell (OHC) excitability and protects cochlea from overstimulation. Cholinergic activation of alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) triggers Ca+2 influx, activating BK and SK2 Ca+2-dependent K+; channels, and K+ extrusion through KCNQ4 to restore membrane potential. KCNQ4-loss causes chronic depolarization, OHC dysfunction, and hearing loss. Here, we investigated how KCNQ4 deficiency affects cochlear efferent synapse development and organization. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we analyzed efferent innervation in the organ of Corti of Kcnq4-/- (KO) and Kcnq4+/+ (WT) mice at 2, 3, 4, and 10 postnatal weeks (W). At 2 W, efferent terminals were similarly distributed between basal and lateral OHC membrane domains in both genotypes. During maturation, WT mice exhibited complete relocation of MOC terminals to the basal domain, whereas KO mice showed delayed maturation, with some terminals laterally displaced up to 10 W. KCNQ4 absence was associated with reduced number and volume of efferent boutons on OHCs. Milder morphometric alterations were observed in efferent boutons within the inner hair cell region. At the molecular level, qPCR revealed downregulation of alpha10 nAChR subunit, BK, and SK2 transcripts in KO at 4 W, with recovery to 10 W. Despite this recovery, BK protein showed reduced expression, mislocalization, and disorganized synaptic plaques in OHCs. KO also displayed age-dependent upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin, suggesting compensatory responses to altered Ca+2 homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that KCNQ4 is essential for OHC repolarization, maturation and maintenance of cochlear efferent synapses.

">Musculoskeletal design of the human shoulder: implications for neuromuscular control</a></h4>

              
                The shoulder complex is a unique musculoskeletal structure capable of versatile motor behaviour yet requiring delicate control. The purpose of our work was to better understand the nature of musculoskeletal redundancy at the shoulder accounting for biomechanical demands and motor control strategies. Using a biomechanical model of the shoulder, we simulated a series of static exertions. Joint moment results from inverse dynamics were combined with an iterative sampling method to survey the landscape of feasible muscle activity patterns. By repeating the sampling process across different numbers of degrees of freedom at the shoulder, we demonstrate how emergent solutions are shaped by the biomechanical demands at each of the shoulder joints. Furthermore, we observed that the degree of musculoskeletal redundancy appears to be higher among the scapulohumeral muscles than the thoracohumeral and thoracoscapular muscles. Finally, we found that many of the muscle activity patterns requiring similar effort costs as the minimal effort solution have similar activation profiles, but there can be a wide range of possibilities especially at greater task intensities. Altogether, the simulations provide insight into neuromuscular control and musculoskeletal model decision-making process for the shoulder.

">Direct evidence from kinetic D2O-MRI modeling that the choroid plexus is not the major source of cerebrospinal fluid</a></h4>

              
                The role of the choroid plexus (CP) as the primary source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains controversial. Here, we used dynamic indirect D2O magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4T to investigate whole-brain CSF dynamics in rats. Spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) was performed during intravenous D2O infusion with a temporal resolution of 10.69 s and an in-plane resolution of 150 * 150 um. An echo time of 150.0 ms was employed to effectively suppress signals from brain parenchyma, blood, and interstitial fluid, resulting in preferential visualization of CSF. The ambient and supracerebellar cisterns (AC+SC) exhibited the greatest signal attenuation, reaching 47.32 +- 15.70% of baseline, whereas the lateral ventricles (LV1, LV2) showed smaller reductions (68.73 +- 18.72%-72.64 +- 15.07% of baseline). CSF production rates were quantified using a one-compartment perfusion model. Estimated secretion rates were 0.11 and 0.13 uL/min in the lateral ventricles and 1.30 uL/min in the AC+SC region, indicating a 5.42-fold higher CSF production outside the ventricles. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the lateral ventricles are not the primary site of CSF production. The proposed D2O-based dynamic SE-EPI approach is safe, non-invasive, cost-effective, and suitable for widespread application.

">CaMKIIα holoenzymes self-organize into worm-like mesoscale clusters</a></h4>

              
                Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is highly enriched in dendritic spines at concentrations comparable to those of cytoskeletal proteins and plays a central role in synaptic plasticity. During long-term potentiation (LTP), CaMKII further accumulates in spines. However, the mechanisms governing its higher-order organization remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize inter-holoenzyme interaction of CaMKII at mesoscopic scales (5-500 nm). Under freely diffusible conditions, CaMKII holoenzymes do not form stable clusters. In contrast, when spatially confined, they assemble into worm-like chain clusters mediated by kinase-domain interactions. These clusters expand upon activation, concomitant with the dissociation of the regulatory segment. Notably, the CaMKII P212L mutant associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, forms extensive clusters even in the basal state. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaMKII-CaMKII interactions drive mesoscale cluster formation and that precise regulation of cluster size and activation-dependent growth might be critical for synaptic signaling.

">A novel protocol for the efficient generation of all three major hippocampal neuronal sub-populations from human pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The diverse computational functions of the human hippocampus rely on coordinated interactions among dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subfields, yet generating all three neuronal identities in vitro - particularly CA1 - has remained challenging. Here we establish a reproducible and modular differentiation protocol that directs human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through dorsomedial telencephalic progenitors to yield DG, CA3, and CA1 neuronal subtypes together with hippocampal regionally specified astrocytes. Early tri-inhibition combined with Sonic hedgehog suppression produced dorsal forebrain progenitors (FOXG1+, PAX6+), while FGF2 treatment supported progenitor maintenance and induced TBR2+ intermediate progenitors. Controlled WNT activation using CHIR99021 drove progressive enrichment of PROX1 hippocampal progenitors across two independent donor lines. Terminal differentiation produced MAP2+/TAU+ neurons that expressed DG (PROX1), CA3 (GRIK4), and CA1 (WFS1, OCT6) markers, with maturing synaptic puncta. Defined progenitors generated long-lived (>400 days) hippocampal organoids exhibiting mixed neuronal-glial populations and spontaneous activity characterized by increased firing rates, high information entropy, and hub-like causal connectivity relative to monolayers, whereas astrocytes-supplemented monolayers displayed intermediate maturation. Population level electrophysiological analysis was also conducted to explore the dynamics of these different cultures. This platform enables systematic experimental control over neuron-astrocyte ratios, culture geometry, and developmental timing, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies of human hippocampal development, circuit function, and disease.

                There is a pressing need for effective alternatives to opioid analgesics, the development of which requires the identification of novel anti-nociceptive drug targets. Here, we have further investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of a GPR35 agonist, cromolyn, in an in vitro model of inflammatory sensitisation. We used ratiometric Ca2+ imaging of cultured sensory neurons to examine the effect of cromolyn on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated sensitisation of the pro-nociceptive ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1). The sensitisation of TRPV1 by PGE2 was inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. These observations provide further evidence in support of an anti-nociceptive role for GPR35, highlighting the potential use of GPR35 agonists as analgesics.

">Evolution of visual time throughout goal driven action learning</a></h4>

              
                Timing is intimately woven into human cognition and behaviour, underscoring people's ability of comprehending speech, playing instruments and competing in sports. Converging evidence suggests that our perceptual experience of time is grounded in our ability to control actions: time processing leverages motor control neural machinery, and perceived time is significantly distorted in proximity of action. However, the dynamic interplay between timing and action systems remains unexplored, particularly in goal-directed contexts where action control is gradually refined through practice. Through combined behavioural, neural and modelling approaches, we investigate how time processing gradually evolves as participants gain experience in goal-driven manual reaching actions, varying in terms of action-plan specificity. Participants judged brief visual durations while preparing hand movements aimed at visual targets displayed on a monitor. Subjective time expanded in the foreperiod preceding action onset, and this effect increased over trials, mirroring gradual improvements in action readiness as motor plans became more rapidly and efficiently deployed. Representation Similarity Analysis, integrating electroencephalographic and behavioural data, reveals that actions shape timing through independent mechanisms: planning specific behaviours shapes how duration information is written into timekeeping neural circuits as stimuli unfold (encoding). Parallely, more general aspects of motor engagement and anticipation shape how duration information is read-out from timing circuits following stimulus presentation (decoding). These findings highlight a dynamic, learning-driven coupling between perceptual time and motor control, where subjective time is recalibrated as goal-directed action preparation is optimized, shaped through independent time encoding and decoding mechanisms.

">Neuronal integrity is altered in the ipsilesional hand sensory territory in late stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sensorimotor remapping plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. While motor remapping has been intensively investigated at various levels, from functional to metabolic, limited attention has been given to somatosensory cortical remapping. This study extends our previous work showing functionally relevant metabolic alterations in radiologically normal-appearing or spared motor cortices, predominantly in the ipsilesional (stroke-injured) hemisphere, during the chronic phase of stroke. Precisely, we investigated the metabolic status of the ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relation to hand impairment in late stroke. Methods: Fourteen individuals with a chronic (mean {+/-} SD, 21.1 {+/-} 36.9 months post-onset) ischemic subcortical stroke, exhibiting moderate hand impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, 44.8 {+/-} 20.9; Jamar dynamometer, 54.1% {+/-} 40.9% of the non-paretic hand), but without sensory deficits, and ten matched healthy controls participated. MR Spectroscopy markers of neuronal status (N-acetylaspartate) and neuronal-glial glutamatergic cycle/neurotransmission (glutamate-glutamine complex) were measured in the ipsilesional S1 (3T, Allegra Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Between-group comparison of brain-tissue-corrected levels of these markers (LCModel, SPM12, MATLAB 2023a) and correlation analyses were performed (SPSS v26). Results: Compared with controls, patients showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate levels (by 14.5%, p = 0.03) but no significant alterations in glutamate-glutamine levels (by -4.0%, p = 0.6). Significant correlations were found between N-acetylaspartate and the glutamate-glutamine complex in patients (p = 0.02), but not in controls (p = 0.06). No significant correlations were found between S1 markers and hand impairment (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with lower cortical excitability in the ipsilesional S1 in chronic stroke survivors. Further work on the functional relevance of such findings, using larger sample sizes, is warranted.

">Probing the Glymphatic System Using Optical Imaging and Mathematical Modeling</a></h4>

              
                The glymphatic system is a macroscopic waste clearance pathway in the central nervous system (CNS), crucial to maintaining neural homeostasis through the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF). Impairments in this system have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, emphasizing the need to understand and potentially improve glymphatic clearance. We investigate tracer diffusion and transport in the glymphatic system by combining optical imaging in rats and mathematical modeling using a partial differential equation of advection-diffusion type. The experimental conditions differ in the levels of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (1.5, 2 and 3%) and the molecular weight of the tracer compounds (1 and 160 kDa). The optimal parameters show a close clustering of the diffusion coefficients and a wider spread of the flow velocities of the cerebrospinal fluid. Our work contributes to a better understanding of flow processes in the brain parenchyma during sleep.

                Deletion of the SNORD116 non-coding RNA is associated with the development of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). We and others have identified NHLH2/Nhlh2 as a putative SNORD116/Snord116 target and in this study report that Nhlh2 and Snord116 are co-expressed in forebrain neurons. Nhlh2 mRNA is found predominantly in the nucleus of Snord116+ hypothalamic neurons but is evenly distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in Snord116- neurons. A hypothalamic cell line co-expressing Nhlh2 and Snord116 recapitulates this nuclear partitioning pattern for Nhlh2 only when the putative Snord116 binding site is present in the 3-prime untranslated region of the Nhlh2 mRNA. In a PWS mouse model (Snord116del), Nhlh2 mRNA levels are unchanged in Pomc neurons but are reduced and primarily cytoplasmic in lateral hypothalamic neurons. These findings demonstrate that Snord116 regulates mRNA levels via mRNA partitioning, fundamentally altering our understanding of gene expression networks in PWS.

                Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is a transmembrane protein that mediates neuron-glia interactions and regulates dendritic spine growth and neuronal migration. Mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene are linked to autism and epilepsy. Younger Cntnap2 KO mice mimic autism phenotypes, while older mice are a model for epilepsy. Thus, comparing behavioral phenotypes across different ages is needed to better understand the age dependent development of disordered brain networks in Cntnap2 mutants. Male and female Cntnap2 KO and WT controls were tested across different age groups (4, 5, 7, 9, and ~11 months) using digging, stimulus (reactivity), and nesting assays. Older Cntnap2 KO mice (7, 9, and ~11 months) showed a significant increase in home cage reactivity (stimulus) assay compared to younger mice at 4 and 5 months of age. Similar trends were observed in male and female Cntnap2 KO mice. No significant differences were observed in WT controls. A significant difference in digging assay was observed in KO female mice between younger (4 month) and older mice post nest removal. An age-dependent significant reduction in nesting behavior was observed in female KO mice; however, no difference was observed in the WT controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed age dependent change interneuron and microglial network in Cntnap2 KO mice. Our findings suggest disruption in home cage behavior and reactivity in older pre-epileptic Cntnap2 KO mice indicating an age-dependent network alteration and behavior deficits.

                Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias are rapidly increasing in prevalence, yet disease-modifying therapies remain largely focused on amyloid-beta with limited efficacy against tau pathology and neuroinflammation, key drivers of neurodegeneration and clinical decline. Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (Dyrk1a) phosphorylates tau and amyloid precursor protein and regulates inflammatory signaling, positioning it as a convergence point across pathogenic pathways. We show that brain Dyrk1a protein levels are consistently elevated across ADRDs, replicating findings in AD, confirming prior observations in Picks disease, and demonstrating dysregulation in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. We developed DYR533, a selective, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant Type 1 Dyrk1a kinase inhibitor that also inhibits autophosphorylation and reduces kinase abundance. Across three mouse models (3xTg-AD, PS19, Ts65Dn), DYR533 reduced pathological tau hyperphosphorylation, attenuated neuroinflammation, ameliorated amyloidosis, and improved anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory, collectively supporting Dyrk1a inhibition and DYR533 as a therapeutic strategy for ADRD.

">EpiBrain: the brain's epigenetic landscape in a snapshot</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetics connect nature with nurture and can help explain how genes, experiences, and the environment influence gene expression to promote individual differences in behavior and mental health. However, how these perturbations induce epigenetic changes across various regions of the brain remains largely unknown. To visualize changes in brain's epigenetic landscape at a glance, we develop EpiBrain, a method utilizing whole-brain imaging and registration to capture epigenetic changes in the entire zebrafish brain in a snapshot. Using this method, we uncovered brain-wide epigenetic changes induced by brain activity, chemical exposures, and genetic mutations. We found that gadd45b, an immediate early gene with epigenetic modulatory activity, mediates experience-induced epigenetic changes in the brain, and that these changes contribute to brain activity and behavioral alterations. EpiBrain enables rapid and unbiased assessment of whole-brain epigenetic changes following physiological and disease-relevant perturbations and facilitates mechanistic discoveries at the molecular level.

">Regional heterogeneity shapes macroscopic wave dynamics of the human and non-human primate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence indicates that macroscopic cortical activity is dominated by propagating waves of excitation. However, many computational models of such wave dynamics assume that the cortex is a spatially homogeneous medium, ignoring the rich regional variations in cellular, molecular, and physiological properties that are known to shape how brain activity evolves through both space and time. Here, we develop a general framework grounded in neural field theory to model how regional heterogeneities in diverse cortical properties shape spatiotemporal brain activity evolving on cortical surface meshes. This enables high resolution, vertex-level simulations without requiring predefined parcellations. The model requires only a standard mesh model of the cortical manifold and a spatial heterogeneity map, providing a biologically grounded and computationally efficient framework that can be generalised to human and non-human species. Using multiple cellular, molecular, and physiological maps in humans--and analogous maps in macaques and marmosets--we show that our model can consistently recapitulate known relationships between regional heterogeneities and variations in cortical wave speed. In particular, we find that models parameterised by heterogeneities in intracortical myelin and excitation-inhibition balance yield the largest performance improvements relative to spatially homogeneous models. Our results identify a key role for regional variations in myelin, receptor, and genetic architecture in shaping the spatial patterning of macroscale cortex-wide activity that is conserved across primate species with diverse cortical geometries.

">IGF1 peptide targets Rett Syndrome astrocytes to degrade IGF binding protein, rescue synaptogenesis and restore mitochondrial function</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, leads to profound synaptic and circuit deficits in the brain. While neurons have historically been the focus of RTT pathology, emerging evidence implicates astrocytes in non-cell autonomous mechanisms that impair synaptic structure, function and development. Here, we uncover a central role for astrocyte-secreted IGFBP2 in mediating these deficits and demonstrate that treatment with an IGF1-derived peptide restores synapse formation by promoting IGFBP2 degradation. Using an indirect astrocyte-neuron co-culture system, we show that astrocytes derived from RTT model mice suppress excitatory synapse formation in wild-type neurons and that this impairment is reversed when RTT astrocytes are treated with IGF1(1-3) peptide. Proteomic analysis reveals elevated levels of IGFBP2 in RTT astrocytes and their conditioned media. IGF1(1-3) peptide treatment leads to proteasomal degradation of IGFBP2, increasing IGF1 bioavailability, restoring mitochondrial function, and enhancing downstream PI3K/Akt signaling in neurons. Our data define a molecular mechanism by which astrocyte dysfunction in RTT can be rescued and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of IGF1(1-3) peptide, including Trofinetide, an FDA-approved IGF1 peptide mimetic, in RTT.

">Super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics reveals cell-type and brain-region-specific modulation of key epitranscriptomic switches following adolescent alcohol exposure</a></h4>

              
                Epitranscriptomic mechanisms dynamically regulate neuronal function through gene expression, but their precise roles in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders remain to be fully elucidated. A major obstacle to advancing such studies is the absence of a methodology for precise, cell-type and brain-region-specific quantification of critical epitranscriptomic regulators under these complex brain conditions. To overcome this challenge, we developed a super-resolved, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics method to quantify key epitranscriptomic switches in intact brains. Using this method, we quantified the expression of Mettl3, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase enzyme recently shown to be upregulated in the amygdala after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rats. We observed a significant increase in cytoplasmic Mettl3 mRNA in neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglia, within the adult central amygdala and the CA1 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus following AIE. In contrast, no significant changes were observed across neurons, astrocytes, or microglia within the basolateral amygdala or the hippocampal CA3. Additionally, we found both the cytoplasmic density and subcellular localization of Mettl3 mRNA were dependent on the specific cell types and brain subregions examined. These results suggest that AIE increases Mettl3 expression in a highly cell-type-specific and spatially heterogeneous manner, underscoring the necessity of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics methods for studying transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic regulations under neurological conditions.

">Single-cell-resolved spatial multi-omics identifies mTOR-driven neuronal and astroglial pathogenicity underlying epileptogenic focal cortical dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a malformation of cortical development caused by somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway. Two hallmark pathological cell types in FCDII, dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells (BCs), arise as a result of somatic mutations in the mTOR signaling pathway and are implicated in the pathophysiology of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, how these somatic mutations reshape cell states within the human cortex remains poorly understood. Here, we integrate imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and proteomics of surgically resected FCDIIb tissue to define the transcriptional and proteomic profiles of DNs and BCs. Spatial mapping of iST data resolved transcriptional signatures in histologically validated DNs and BCs within FCDIIb sections. Integrative omics analysis further revealed that DNs show upregulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and p53-CROT metabolic programs accompanied by suppression of synaptic signaling, whereas BCs exhibit transcriptional signatures of reactive astrocytes with increased phagocytic and immune-like activity. These data delineate cell-type-specific consequences of somatic mTOR pathway mutations at single-cell resolution and reveal previously unrecognized metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis in drug-resistant epilepsy. Our study establishes a spatial multi-omics framework for dissecting human cortical malformations and highlights potential therapeutic targets for drug-resistant epilepsy.

">Astrocytic response to traumatic brain injury to rescue neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial transfer</a></h4>

              
                As highly dynamic organelles, mitochondria play an essential role in neuronal survival and synaptic function. Excitotoxicity is as a critical factor that promotes mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intercellular mitochondrial transfer and exogenous mitochondrial transplantation are emerging concepts to understand mitochondrial trafficking in response to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, robust in vivo evidence remains limited on the extent of these processes in the central nervous system (CNS). There is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of mitochondrial transfer mechanisms under both normal physiological conditions and after experimental TBI. Mouse lines expressing mitochondrial green-fluorescent dendra-2 (mtD2) and GFP (mtGFP) targeted to inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively, were used to study astrocyte-specific (Aldh1l1-CreER; mtD2f/f-AmtD2 and Aldh1l1-CreER; mtGFPf/f-AmtGFP) and neuron-specific (CamK2aCre; mtD2f/f-NmtD2 and CamK2aCre; mtGFPf/f-NmtGFP) mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in acute TBI and excitotoxicity. At 24 hrs following TBI, neurons in the NmtD2 mouse brain exhibited rapid and significant alterations in mitochondrial morphology, including changes in total mitochondrial volume, volume distribution, and sphericity. Synaptic neuronal (SN) mitochondria display robust deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics and complex protein levels while non-synaptic neuronal (NSN) mitochondria show State III bioenergetics and complex proteins at control levels. These findings are accompanied by a marked increase in astrocyte-derived mitochondria (AmtGFP) transfer to neurons at 24 hrs post-injury, compared to control animals, but no increase in transfer to neuronal synapses. While TBI also altered astrocytic mitochondrial morphology in the cortex, astrocytic mitochondrial bioenergetics remained preserved. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes revealed significant transcriptional reprogramming following TBI, characterized by the upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis and the machinery for organelle trafficking. In vitro co-cultures of primary cortical astrocytes and neurons demonstrated that astrocytes can transfer mitochondria to neurons via direct contact and that NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity further enhanced this astrocyte-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer. Furthermore, astrocytic-derived extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EV-mito) deliver mitochondria to neurons and EV-mediated mitochondrial transfer significantly ameliorated NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cortical neurons. Together, these findings show that astrocytes take on a TBI-related phenotype that facilitates dynamic changes in mitochondrial networks and mitochondrial trafficking to neurons. Astrocytic transfer of respiratory-competent mitochondria support is an intrinsic neuroprotective response to injury that supports mitochondrial function in neuronal soma, dendrites, and axons but not at the neuronal synapse. Finally, we show therapeutic potential of exogenous mitochondrial transfer, particularly via EV-mito, for treating neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity, such as TBI.

">Geometric structure of features underlies human VTC object recognition.</a></h4>

              
                The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) plays a crucial role in human object recognition. Within VTC neural space, object-specific domains align with domain-general features, e.g. face- and scene-domain align with the feature distribution of animacy, generating a hierarchical knowledge structure for categorization. However, the neural process of integrating information from VTC to distinguish different objects remains unclear. Here, we employed a combination of ANN modeling, functional MRI, and MEG to investigate how VTC features affect object manifold separability. The representational geometry analysis shows that domain-general features in VTC form a unique structure, different from ANN, to assist object classification. Moreover, VTC dynamically adjusts the geometrical relationship of these features during object recognition, influencing the geometrical properties of object manifolds and, consequently, their separability. These findings advance our understanding of the neural computation involved in VTC object recognition, revealing how downstream neurons can flexibly access category information in diverse recognition tasks.

                Mounting evidence shows sex-based differences in sleep experiences and outcomes, including the prevalence of insomnia disorder. However, the impact of biological sex on brain oscillations during sleep remains poorly understood, especially in the context of insomnia disorder. This is a notable gap, given that neurophysiological aspects of sleep are associated with brain health and overall sleep quality. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed data from studies reporting spindle and slow wave activity in adults with and without insomnia disorder. We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, with thirteen studies of normal sleepers (N= 668) reporting sufficient data for random-effects meta-analyses. Compared with males, female normal sleepers had higher spindle density, sigma and delta power. Most studies recruited individuals with primary insomnia, and data pooling for insomnia and mixed groups was not possible due to insufficient statistical reporting. Moreover, group-by-sex interactions were limited, inconsistent, and varied across studies and sample characteristics. Further research is needed to explore sex-specific differences in sleep microarchitecture and their role in normal sleep and the manifestation of insomnia disorder.

                <p>Mirror invariance is the cognitive tendency to perceive mirror-image objects as identical. Mirrored letters, however, are distinct orthographic units and must be identified as different despite having the same shape. Consistent with this phenomenon, a small, localized region in the ventral visual stream, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), exhibits repetition suppression to both identical and mirror pairs of objects but only to identical, not mirror, pairs of letters (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pegado et al., 2011</cross-ref>), a phenomenon named mirror invariance "breaking". The ability of congenitally blind individuals to "break" mirror invariance for pairs of mirrored Braille letters has been demonstrated behaviorally (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">de Heering et al., 2018</cross-ref>,   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Korczyk et al., 2024</cross-ref>). However, its neural underpinnings have not yet been investigated. Here, in an fMRI repetition suppression paradigm, congenitally blind individuals (8 males and 10 females) recognized pairs of everyday objects and Braille letters in identical ("p" and "p"), mirror ("p" and "q"), and different ("p" and "z") orientations. We found repetition suppression for identical and mirror pairs of everyday objects in the parietal and ventral-lateral occipital cortex, indicating that mirror-invariant object recognition engages the ventral visual stream in tactile modality as well. However, repetition suppression for identical but not mirrored pairs of Braille letters was found not in the VWFA, but in broad areas of the left parietal cortex and the lateral occipital cortex. These results suggest that reading-related orthographic processes in blind individuals depend on different neural computations than those of the sighted.</p>

Each rig within the EMU can provide 16-channel high-fidelity, DC-sensitive biopotential recordings, head acceleration monitoring, voltammetry applications, and synchronized video recording on one freely moving rat. We present the overall EMU architecture design and subsystem details in each recording rig. We demonstrate long-term continuous in vivo recordings of spontaneous seizure and seizure-associated spreading depolarization from freely moving rats (male, 21; female, 6) prepared under the tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

                <p>by Junhui Peng, Li Zhao</p>

Proteins function through dynamic interactions with other proteins in cells, forming complex networks fundamental to cellular processes. While high-resolution and high-throughput methods have significantly advanced our understanding of how proteins interact with each other, the molecular details of many important protein-protein interactions are still poorly characterized, especially in non-mammalian species, including <i>Drosophila</i>. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have enabled the prediction of molecular details in various cellular pathways at the network level. In this study, we used AlphaFold2 multimer to examine and predict protein-protein interactions from both physical and functional datasets in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that functional associations contribute significantly to high-confidence predictions. Through detailed structural analysis, we also found the importance of intrinsically disordered regions in the predicted high-confidence interactions. Our study highlights the importance of disordered regions in protein-protein interactions and demonstrates the importance of incorporating functional interactions in predicting physical interactions between proteins. We further compiled an interactive web interface to present the predictions, facilitating functional exploration, comparative analysis, and the generation of mechanistic hypotheses for future studies.

                <p>by Constandina Koki, Alessio V. Inchingolo, Abdullahi Daniyan, Enyu Li, Andrew D. McAinsh, Nigel J. Burroughs</p>

Mitosis is a complex self-organising process that achieves high fidelity separation of duplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells through capture and alignment of chromosomes to the spindle mid-plane. Chromosome movements are driven by kinetochores (KTs), multi-protein machines that attach chromosomes to microtubules (MTs), and through those attachments both control and generate directional forces. Using lattice light sheet microscopy imaging and automated near-complete tracking of kinetochores at fine spatio-temporal resolution, we produce a detailed atlas of kinetochore metaphase-anaphase dynamics in untransformed human cells (RPE1). Such data allows dynamic models to be reverse engineered and biological hypotheses to be addressed. We determined the support from this dataset for 17 models of metaphase dynamics using Bayesian inference, demonstrating (1) substantial sister asymmetry that generates transverse organisation of the metaphase plate (MPP), (2) substantial spatial organisation of KT dynamic properties within the MPP, and (3) significant time dependence of the K-fiber mechanical parameters whereby K-fiber forces tune over the last 5 mins of metaphase towards a set point, referred to as the anaphase ready state. These spatio-temporal trends are robust to perturbation of the spindle assembly pathway (nocodazole washout treatment), suggesting that the underlying processes generating kinetochore heterogeneity are intrinsic to mitosis and possibly play a role in ensuring high-fidelity segregation.

                <p>by Pranav Mahajan, Peter Dayan, Ben Seymour</p>

Injuries are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life, leading to an evolutionary mandate for powerful homeostatic processes of recovery and recuperation. The physiological responses of the body and the immune system must be coordinated with behaviour to allow protected time for this to happen, and to prevent further damage to the affected bodily parts. Reacting appropriately requires an internal control system that represents the nature and state of the injury and specifies and withholds actions accordingly. We bring the formal uncertainties embodied in this system into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process. We discuss nociceptive phenomena in light of this analysis, noting particularly the counter-intuitive behaviours associated with injury investigation, and the propensity for transitions from normative, tonic, to pathological, chronic pain states. Importantly, these simulation results provide a quantitative account and enable us to sketch a much needed roadmap for future theoretical and experimental studies on injury, tonic pain, and the transition to chronic pain.

                <p>by Upama Aich, Chloe Tan, Rebecca Bathgate, Khandis R. Blake, Robert C. S. Capp, Jacob C. Kuek, Bob B. M. Wong, Brian S. Mautz, Michael D. Jennions</p>

Why the human penis is unusually large compared to that of other primates is a long-standing evolutionary question. Sexual selection, through female mate choice and male-male competition, is a likely driver, but confirming this is difficult due to natural covariation among traits. The solution is to experimentally manipulate focal traits to identify targets of selection. Using 343 computer-generated male figures that varied in penis size, height and body shape, we experimentally tested how these traits influence perceived attractiveness and fighting ability. Over 800 participants—both male and female—viewed either life-sized (in-person) or scaled (online) animations and rated the figures. Across both settings, selection analyses revealed consistent directional selection favoring taller men with a more V-shaped body and a larger penis. In both surveys, male participants rated rivals with a larger penis as more sexually competitive and physically threatening. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size. Our findings suggest that female choice and male-male competition have jointly favored larger penis size, greater height, and more V-shaped bodies in men.

                <p>by Xiao Chen Shi, Rui Xin Zhang, Jun Kai Feng, Jia Hao Chen, Jian Feng Zhang, Jun Ying Xiao, Xiao Peng Liu, Huan Liu, Bo Xia, Li Nong Yao, Jiang Wei Wu</p>

Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that significantly affects patients’ quality of life and prognosis, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Optineurin (OPTN) as an active regulator for maintenance of muscle homeostasis during muscle atrophy. Knockdown (KD) of Optn induces muscle atrophy, while overexpression of Optn alleviated dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in mice. Mechanistically, we for the first time identified Junction plakoglobin (JUP) as a novel interacting partner of OPTN. OPTN alleviates muscle atrophy in a JUP-dependent manner, corroborating JUP as the downstream effector of OPTN-mediated muscle atrophy. RNA-seq analysis revealed that PI3K-AKT pathway is markedly downregulated in Optn-KD muscle, and pharmacological activation of PI3K-AKT pathway effectively rescued muscle atrophy in Optn-KD mice. We further show that OPTN coordinates the interaction between JUP and PI3-Kinase p85 in muscle, promoting activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Collectively, our study proposed a conceptual novelty that OPTN-JUP axis mediated activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway during muscle atrophy. These findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of muscle atrophy and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for this condition.

                Purpose This study aims to investigate the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with management accounting techniques and their impact on improving financial reporting, accountability, transparency, and the quality and efficiency of information. It also explores how this integration affects stakeholder trust in banks. Design/Methodology/Approach A structured questionnaire was used to survey 100 employees working in banks such Accountants, bankers, and specialized academics regarding AI and managerial accounting practices, and reporting quality. Quantitative models using structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to analyze the direct and indirect relationships between the variables. Results The results indicate that integrating AI technologies with management accounting does not necessarily lead to a direct increase in trust in banks. Rather, this is achieved through high-quality financial reporting, which acts as an intermediary between technological advancement and trust building. While banks strive to generate strong internal key performance indicators (KPIs) and functional accuracy, these should be disseminated clearly to gain the trust of customers and investors. Practical Implications The researchers’ findings, which focus on integrating artificial intelligence with management accounting, do not directly increase trust in banks. Rather, this effect is mediated by high-quality financial reporting. Therefore, it is essential for the studied government banks to focus on producing accurate and clear performance indicators and publishing them transparently to enhance their credibility and gain the trust of customers and investors. Originality/Value This study makes a pivotal contribution to academic literature and adds to the limited body of research on the integration of artificial intelligence, management accounting, financial reporting, and trust in banks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-104/v1?src=rss">Building High-Performing Workforces: The Joint Influence of Digital Experience and Organizational Culture via Employee Engagement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rapid digital transformation and evolving organizational environments have increased the importance of understanding how workplace technologies and cultural conditions influence employee behavior and performance. Digital Employee Experience (DEX) and Organizational Culture are increasingly recognized as critical organizational resources that shape employees’ psychological states, particularly Employee Engagement, which subsequently drives individual performance. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding how these factors simultaneously interact within highly regulated and operationally complex industries such as aviation. Methods This study employed a quantitative explanatory design using data collected from 340 employees of PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) Tbk across five major directorates. A structured questionnaire measured DEX, Organizational Culture, Employee Engagement, and Employee Performance using validated reflective indicators. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test direct and mediating effects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity, meeting thresholds for outer loadings, composite reliability, AVE, and discriminant validity. Results The findings indicate that both Digital Employee Experience and Organizational Culture have significant positive effects on Employee Engagement and Employee Performance. Employee Engagement emerged as the strongest predictor of performance and served as a significant mediator linking DEX and Organizational Culture to performance outcomes. The structural model showed substantial explanatory power, indicating that organizational and digital resources influence performance largely through their effects on employee psychological engagement. Conclusions The study provides empirical support for the Job Demands–Resources framework by demonstrating that digital work environments and strong organizational cultures function as key job resources that enhance engagement and, in turn, improve performance. For organizations particularly in the aviation sector investing in high-quality digital systems, strengthening cultural alignment, and fostering employee engagement are essential strategies for sustaining performance in the face of digital transformation. Future research should incorporate longitudinal designs and multi-source data to further validate these findings.

                Recently, studies have focused on producing green, sustainable concrete with improved environmental performance, utilizing recycled waste materials. The early compressive strength of Green High Strength Concrete (GHSC) containing up to 60% ultrafine palm oil fuel ash (UPOFA) has been optimized utilizing hybrid materials, Silica Fume (SF), steel fiber (ST), and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) fiber. UPOFA was used as a substitute binder for cement in GHSC manufacture at 0%, 30%, and 60% replacement levels. SF was substituted for 0%, 10%, and 20% of the residual cement mass. Steel fiber and PET fiber were included at a rate of 1% of the total binder mass. The mix design parameters were optimized using the Response Surface Method (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) approach. The experimental results showed that the GHSC containing 30% UPOFA, 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fiber reached greater strength at 3, 7, and 28 days. The incorporation of 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fibers enhanced the early ages strength reduction of 60% UPOFA-GHSC by 17%, 25%, and 18% at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively, relative to the control mix. The constructed models showed significant correlation values (R2) of 0.9697, 0.9546, and 0.9674 for compressive strength at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively. Hence, RSM may be an efficient technique for improving mix design while lowering environmental impact by limiting waste volume and energy usage in cement manufacture, which contributes to the sustainability of concrete.

     alt="Innervation Drives Postembryonic Expansion of the Zebrafish Anterior Lateral Line System"/>
<p>A dramatic expansion of the anterior lateral line system occurs during zebrafish ontogeny, largely driven by the addition of superficial neuromasts. Here, we describe a new hybrid-origin mechanism of neuromast addition and uncover a larval-stage developmental switch to an innervation-dependent phase of expansion.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lateral line system is an essential sensory modality used by fishes and aquatic amphibians to sense hydrodynamic information. The system comprises distributed sense organs called neuromasts and their afferent nerves, organized into anterior lateral lines around the eye and jaw and posterior lateral lines (LL) on the trunk. At postembryonic stages, early forming neuromasts expand in size and sink into bony canals, while late-forming superficial neuromasts are added as the fish grows. Unlike the well-studied zebrafish posterior LL, details of anterior LL postembryonic development remain unknown. Here, we have characterized developmental mechanisms and innervation patterns driving expansion of the zebrafish anterior LL. Using tissue-clearing to observe neuromast and nerve markers through ontogeny, we demonstrate continuous neuromast addition in the anterior LL, with peak rates at larval stages of 7–10 mm standard length (SL). Lines of superficial neuromasts form parallel to existing lines of presumptive canal neuromasts as late as 7 mm SL, with new neuromasts added through migration of new primordia, budding, intercalation, and a novel “hybrid-origin” mechanism. Despite some canal lines being innervated by the anterodorsal ganglion, all superficial lines are innervated by the anteroventral ganglion. Anterior LL ganglion ablation reveals that denervation abrogates superficial neuromast formation—including via the hybrid-origin mechanism—and reduces growth of canal neuromasts. While the anterior and posterior LL use disparate developmental mechanisms, innervation is critical to the expansion of both. Our findings reveal a “developmental switch” at 7 mm SL, when innervation becomes necessary for a secondary phase of anterior LL development.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This paper describes the events leading up to the discovery of the place cells in 1971 for which the author received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2014, together with May-Britt and Edvard Moser. In addition, it explores some of the ideas and influences that contributed to the interpretation of that finding as evidence for the Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Crucial to the acceptance of the idea of place cells and cognitive maps has been the development of recording technologies, and some of these are covered in the middle section. The final section tries to draw some lessons that the author has reached from his experiences.</p>

                Casto et al. systematically examine language-responsive regions of the cerebellum with precision fMRI. They find one region that closely resembles the neocortical language network in its selectivity for language and response to linguistic manipulations. They also find three mixed-selective regions that respond to language but also to non-linguistic inputs.

                Ning et al. show that macaque prefrontal neurons encode remembered spatial locations along with uncertainty and combine them with cues, such as trial history and arousal, to generate a meta-working-memory signal guiding opt-out decisions. The findings reveal how the prefrontal cortex integrates multiple components for metacognitive judgments of working memory.

                Sun et al. identify a mechanosensitive pathway linking ECM stiffness to neuroblastoma cell migration. Rigid ECM drives NB cell migration by enhancing post-mitotic NPC assembly and transport via the lamin A/C/E2F4/PLK1 axis. Furthermore, clinical data suggest targeting NPC function as a potential therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma.

Inhibiting SIX/EYA impairs high-SIX1 AML, supporting RDGN targeting as a biomarker-informed therapeutic approach.
