              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22067">Dimensions of Vulnerability in Visual Working Memory: An AI-Driven Approach to Perceptual Comparison</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily life. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g., during cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous studies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual comparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory distortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying what visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel research question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates naturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions to elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli -- image wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated by dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM) experiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three conditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels, and perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar dimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions. Specifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic dimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual stimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22216">Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22313">Decoding Neural Signatures of Semantic Evaluations in Depression and Suicidality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22785">An Uncertainty Principle for Probabilistic Computation in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic model of early visual processing, beginning with the interaction between a light wavefront and the retina. We argue that perception originates not with deterministic transduction, but with probabilistic threshold crossings shaped by quantum photon arrival statistics and biological variability. We formalize this with an uncertainty relation, \( \Delta \alpha \cdot \Delta t \geq \eta \), through the transformation of light into symbolic neural code through the layered retinal architecture. Our model is supported by previous experimental results, which show intrinsic variability in retinal responses even under fixed stimuli. We contrast this with a classical null hypothesis of deterministic encoding and propose experiments to further test our uncertainty relation. By re-framing the retina as a probabilistic measurement device, we lay the foundation for future models of cortical dynamics rooted in quantum-like computation. We are not claiming that the brain could be working as a quantum-system, but rather putting forth the argument that the brain as a classical system could still implement quantum-inspired computations. We define quantum-inspired computation as a scheme that includes both probabilistic and time-sensitive computation, clearly separating it from classically implementable probabilistic systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17650">Agency Perception and Brain Synchrony: A Hyperscanning Study of Human-Human and Human-AI Interaction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.17650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates how the human brain differentiates between intentional human agents and artificial intelligence (AI) agents during real-time social interaction. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we recorded prefrontal brain activity of participants as they played a one-on-one virtual tennis game, once against a human opponent and once against an AI-controlled opponent. Task-related cortical activation was evaluated using the General Linear Model (GLM), while inter-brain synchrony was assessed through Intersubject Correlation (ISC) analysis. Results revealed significantly stronger activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) when participants interacted with human opponents, particularly in low-frequency hemodynamic bands (0.0098-0.0196 Hz). Moreover, neural synchrony between human dyads was significantly greater than in pseudo-paired controls, with distinct frequency-specific coupling patterns across channels. In contrast, AI interactions elicited reduced cortical engagement and no measurable inter-brain synchrony. These findings suggest that the perception of intentionality strongly modulates social brain responses, even when task structure and behavior remain constant. This work highlights the utility of fNIRS hyperscanning for studying naturalistic human interactions and provides neural evidence for the brain's sensitivity to perceived agency. The results have implications for the design of socially interactive AI systems that more effectively engage human cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20205">Signed Higher-Order Interactions for Brain Disorder Diagnosis via Multi-Channel Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.20205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409">Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.11409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2504.08637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of neural computation is founded on the assumption that neurons fire in response to a linear summation of inputs. Yet experiments demonstrate that some neurons are capable of complex computations that require interactions between inputs. Here we show, across multiple brain regions and species, that simple computations (without interactions between inputs) explain most of the variability in neuronal activity. Neurons are quantitatively described by models that capture the measured dependence on each input individually, but assume nothing about combinations of inputs. These minimal models, which are equivalent to binary artificial neurons, predict complex higher-order dependencies and recover known features of synaptic connectivity. The inferred computations are low-dimensional, indicating a highly redundant neural code that is necessary for error correction. These results suggest that, despite intricate biophysical details, most neurons perform simple computations typically reserved for artificial models.

                arXiv:2507.22146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a biologically inspired model of spiking neurons based on the dynamics of a damped, driven pendulum. Unlike traditional models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, the pendulum neuron incorporates second-order, nonlinear dynamics that naturally give rise to oscillatory behavior and phase-based spike encoding. This model captures richer temporal features and supports timing-sensitive computations critical for sequence processing and symbolic learning. We present an analysis of single-neuron dynamics and extend the model to multi-neuron layers governed by Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rules. We demonstrate practical implementation with python code and with the Brian2 spiking neural simulator, and outline a methodology for deploying the model on neuromorphic hardware platforms, using an approximation of the second-order equations. This framework offers a foundation for developing energy-efficient neural systems for neuromorphic computing and sequential cognition tasks.

We introduce two novel hybrid activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4 (smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression. The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths, making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for improving neural network training dynamics.

                arXiv:2507.22131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However, this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity, unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE. The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and practicality for dynamic network conditions.

                arXiv:2507.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm's stagnation.

                arXiv:2507.22787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.

                arXiv:2507.22832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

                arXiv:2503.08394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.

                arXiv:2407.05650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.

                arXiv:2408.11198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have seen increasing use in various software development tasks, especially in code generation. The most advanced recent methods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to help guide LLMs in generating correct code in an iterative process. While effective, these methods could be costly due to numerous interactions with the LLM and extensive token usage. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for Code (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to refine the original prompts into improved versions that generate high quality code, with minimal interactions with the LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM based code generation agents shows that EPiC not only achieves up to 6% improvement in pass@k but is also 2-10 times more cost-effective than the baselines.

Abstract: We explore the capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with a policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in the MuJoCo Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to produce high-performing agents, showcasing evolution's ability to tackle the training of even such complex models.

">AI-assisted modeling of attentional control for intervention engagement</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive training is one of the most used cognitive interventions, aiming for preventing or slowing cognitive decline in older adults. However, its effect is inconsistent, often due to the lack of effective engagement. Here we developed a novel AI-assisted multimodal framework, called Attentional Control Index using Digital measures (AID), which combines video-based facial expression analysis with ECG-derived heart rate variability (HRV) to assess the availability and allocation of attentional resources during cognitive training. Using two independent datasets of older adults at elevated risk for cognitive impairment, we demonstrated that AID accurately predicts both behavioral markers of engagement and cognitive outcomes from cognitive training. Additionally, we identified interpretable facial expressions and HRV features that reflect attentional control. These findings establish a robust, generalizable digital marker for assessing, and potentially in the future, enhancing effective engagement in cognitive training by focusing on the real-time dynamics of individual users' attentional control.

                <p>Accurate perception of the direction of gravity relies on the integration of multisensory information, particularly from the visual and vestibular systems, within the brain. Although a recent study of patients with cerebellar degeneration suggested a cerebellar role in visuo-vestibular interaction in the perception of gravitational direction, direct evidence remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted two experiments with 42 healthy participants to evaluate the impact of repetitive 1&nbsp;Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the posterior cerebellar vermis on visual dependency, quantified by the subjective visual vertical bias induced by rotating optokinetic stimulation (OKS). Electric field simulations in high-resolution generic head models were used to ensure focal stimulation of the cerebellum at the group level. The results demonstrated that the rTMS applied to the vermis significantly attenuated the OKS-induced shift in visual vertical (SVV) bias. This effect was not observed when stimulation was applied to the early visual cortex (V1&ndash;2) or the cerebellar hemisphere. Also, the vermis rTMS had no effect on the judgment precision in the absence of visual motion cues, suggesting that the rTMS may reduce visual weight in visuo-vestibular processing by increasing visual motion noise rather than affecting vestibular function. These findings suggest a direct involvement of the cerebellar vermis in the visuo-vestibular interaction underlying the perception of gravitational direction, providing new insights into cerebellar contributions in human spatial orientation.</p>

                <p>Early childhood is a critical period showing experience-dependent changes in brain structure and function. The complex link between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain is of particular interest. However, its relationship with both age and attention in early childhood is not well understood. In this study, children between the ages of 4 and 7, and at a 1&nbsp;year follow-up visit, underwent neuroimaging (diffusion-weighted and passive-viewing functional magnetic resonance imaging) and assessments for selective, sustained, and executive attention. We examined regional graph metrics and SC&ndash;FC coupling of the structural and functional networks. Partial least squares was used to investigate longitudinal brain measure changes and cross-sectional associations with age and attention. We observed longitudinal changes in functional graph metrics and age-related decreases in SC modularity. Region-wise graph analyses revealed variable brain&ndash;behavior relationships across the brain, highlighting regions where structural topology is linked to age and attentional performance. Furthermore, we identified SC as a dominant predictor of age when compared with FC and SC&ndash;FC coupling. The findings emphasize how early childhood is a dynamic period where cognitive functioning is intricately and predominantly linked to structural network features.</p>

                <p>Recent evidence highlights the importance of glutamatergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) in promoting cortical activity; however, whether BF glutamatergic neurons are involved in regulating general anesthesia and the underlying neural circuits remains unclear. Here, we showed that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased during the induction of isoflurane anesthesia and restored during the emergence in mice. Optogenetic activation of these neurons significantly enhanced cortical activation, accelerated behavioral emergence, and improved physiological indicators in both male and female mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Specifically, activation of BF glutamatergic neurons shortened emergence time from isoflurane anesthesia, decreased isoflurane sensitivity, and increased arousal scores of mice. Moreover, optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased EEG delta power and burst suppression ratio, while increasing pupil size and respiration rate in mice during isoflurane anesthesia. Similar results were observed during the optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Additionally, we found that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons and VTA glutamatergic neurons synchronously fluctuated during isoflurane anesthesia, and optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the VTA potently increased the calcium signals in VTA glutamatergic neurons during isoflurane anesthesia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that BF glutamatergic neurons promote emergence from isoflurane anesthesia by activating VTA glutamatergic neurons.</p>

                <p>In daily life, we frequently encounter items within emotional contexts through repeated exposure. However, it remains unclear how emotion influences the memory of items learned across multiple repetitions and how neural representations during repeated learning are associated with subsequent memory performance. In the current study, participants learned meaningless squiggles, each followed by an emotional image (positive, neutral, or negative), with each squiggle&ndash;image pair presented three times during encoding. After a 24&nbsp;h delay, a recognition memory test for the squiggles was performed. The results indicated that behaviorally squiggles were more accurately retrieved in the positive condition compared with the negative condition. An old/new ERP effect was observed between 400 and 1,200&nbsp;ms at the midparietal cluster, specific to the positive condition, and correlated with memory performance. Notably, greater EEG representational similarity of neural patterns across repeated learning was observed for subsequently remembered items compared with forgotten items in the positive condition, specifically at the right frontal region between 380 and 600&nbsp;ms. These findings suggest that positive emotion enhances memory of neutral items across repeated learning through neural representational reinstatement, offering insights into how emotional differences in episodic memory retrieval are linked to neural patterns established during repeated learning.</p>

                <p>When we encounter people in real life, increased visual experience with their face is accompanied by an accumulation of conceptual knowledge about them. This conceptual knowledge has been shown to play an important role in face recognition. However, the extent to which conceptual knowledge influences neural responses to faces in visual or non-visual regions of the brain is not clear. To address this question, participants (male and female) learned faces in a naturalistic viewing paradigm in which conceptual information was modulated by presenting a movie to participants in either its original sequence or a scrambled sequence. Although participants in both groups had the same overall perceptual experience, this manipulation had a significant effect on the conceptual understanding of events. After a delay, participants viewed a new movie featuring the previously learned faces while neural activity was measured using fMRI. No significant differences were observed between the Original and Scrambled groups in core face-selective regions of the visual brain. This aligns with the fact that overall exposure to faces was consistent across groups, ensuring that our manipulation did not impact visual processing of faces. In contrast, differences between the groups were evident within a network of regions that are typically associated with processing person knowledge. This network of regions was also able to discriminate the identity of the key characters based on the response to the faces. These findings provide important insights into the level of neural processing at which conceptual knowledge influences familiar face recognition during natural viewing.</p>

                <p>Music can effectively induce emotional arousal, which is associated with the release of stress hormones that are important for the emotional modulation of memory. Thus, music may serve as a powerful modulator of memory and mood, making it a promising therapeutic tool for memory and mood disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or depression. However, music's impact on memory depends on its features, timing, and ability to elicit emotional arousal. In the current study, we manipulated various features of music played during post-encoding memory consolidation to elicit emotional arousal and impact subsequent memory in men and women. We found that larger increases and moderate decreases in post-encoding music-induced emotional arousal from baseline resulted in gist versus detail trade-offs in memory, with improved general memory but impaired detailed memory, while moderate increases in arousal from baseline corresponded to improved detailed memory, but impaired general memory. Importantly, relative to controls, music-induced emotional arousal demonstrated unique impacts on detailed memory that are crucial in supporting episodic memory. These findings suggest that music intervention does not uniformly impact memory and has important implications in developing personalized music-related interventions for those with memory and mood impairments.</p>

                <p>Cortical beta band oscillations (13&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) are associated with sensorimotor control, but their precise role remains unclear. Evidence suggests that for low-threshold motor neurons (MNs), these oscillations are conveyed to muscles via the fastest corticospinal fibers. However, their transmission to MNs of different sizes may vary due to differences in the relative strength of corticospinal and reticulospinal projections across the MN pool. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether corticospinal beta transmission follows similar pathways and maintains consistent strength across the entire MN pool. To investigate this, we examined beta activity in MNs innervating the tibialis anterior muscle across the full range of recruitment thresholds in a study involving 12 participants of both sexes. We characterized beta activity at both the cortical and motor unit (MU) levels, while participants performed contractions from mild to submaximal levels. Corticomuscular coherence remained unchanged across contraction forces after normalizing for the net MU spike rate, suggesting that beta oscillations are transmitted with similar strength to MNs, regardless of size. To further explore beta transmission, we estimated corticospinal delays using the cumulant density function, identifying peak correlations between cortical and muscular activity. Once compensated for variable peripheral axonal propagation delay across MNs, the corticospinal delay remained stable, and its value (~14&nbsp;ms) indicated projections through the fastest corticospinal fibers for all MNs. These findings demonstrate that corticospinal beta band transmission is determined by the fastest pathway connecting in the corticospinal tract, projecting similarly across the entire MN pool.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by death of lower and upper motor neurons. Although the mechanism behind the selective neuron loss is still unclear, several heterogeneous genes have been causally linked to ALS. <I>KIF5A</I> encodes for a neuronally enriched kinesin involved in protein transport, and mutations within this gene have been causally linked to different motor neuron diseases. The mutations identified in ALS patients are mostly predicted to alter its mRNA splicing, leading to a frameshift mutation and an aberrant 39-aa-long sequence in the C-terminal domain of KIF5A. Here we found that ALS-related KIF5A mutations induce the accumulation of the mutant form of the protein in human motoneurons, which are also characterized by the cytosolic mislocalization of TDP-43. This ALS hallmark was even exacerbated upon overexpression of the ALS-KIF5A protein in cells differentiated from healthy controls and primary neurons, suggesting a pathological connection between the cellular load of the mutant protein and TDP-43 pathology. While the terminal domain of the WT isoform is characterized by an acid isoelectric point (pI), the ALS variant presents a basic pI due to the altered aminoacidic composition of this sequence. We thus generated a KIF5A-ALS isoform that retained part of the aberrant sequence but with lower pI. The overexpression of this mutated variant led to significantly lower protein aggregation and TDP-43 mislocalization than the ALS mutant. Our data show that re-establishing the correct pI rescues KIFA aggregation and significantly reduces the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43.</p>

Neurodegeneration early affects subcortical structures, including the substantia nigra, in iRBD patients. However, it remains unclear whether there is also an early neurodegeneration process affecting the cerebral cortex. We investigated whether EEG-derived metrics for aberrant cortical dynamics and imbalanced excitation&ndash;inhibition (E/I) correlate with disease severity in iRBD patients, aiming to better understand the pathophysiology progression from the prodromal to the overt stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. We retrospectively analyzed resting-state EEG recordings, as a marker of cortical function, and presynaptic dopaminergic imaging, a marker of subcortical function from 59 iRBD patients (9 female) who underwent longitudinal clinical evaluation alongside 46 age-matched healthy controls (22 female). We assessed power-law scaling in long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), neuronal bistability, and functional E/I balance from the resting-state sensor EEG data and then correlated these to large-scale synchrony, nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, and clinical data. Compared with the control group, patients showed higher LRTCs and bistability in 2&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz oscillations. Patients who developed parkinsonism/dementia exhibited hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz compared with those who did not. This was also correlated with stronger phase synchrony. Both hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz and bistability in 2&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz negatively associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment. The iRBD patients, especially those closer to phenoconversion to parkinsonism or dementia, show clear aberrant cortical dynamics and hyperexcitability alongside substantia nigra impairment, suggesting that neurodegeneration in the prodromal stages affects both subcortical structures and cortical dynamics.</p>

                <p>From navigating a crowded hallway to skiing down a treacherous hill, humans are constantly making decisions while moving. Insightful past work has provided a glimpse of decision deliberation at the moment of movement onset. Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes&mdash;prior to a decision&mdash;directing online movements. The deliberation process was manipulated by having humans of either sex observe tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behavior in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window to understand the interplay between decision and action.</p>

                <p>Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes sensitization of hippocampal neurons associated with enhanced contextual fear memory. Because enhanced fear memory is an integral component of posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological basis of neuronal sensitization in the hippocampus after social defeat was investigated in male mice using two interventions: microglia depletion (CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622) and neuronal (Vglut2<sup>+</sup>) IL-1R1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Here, two single-nuclei (sn) RNAseq data sets using these interventions were integrated and compared. Social defeat altered the transcriptional profiles of CA1 (Satb2<sup>+</sup>), dentate gyrus (DG, Prox1<sup>+</sup>), and inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons, and these stress profiles were influenced by nIL-1R1, microglia, or both. In DG neurons, differentially expressed genes and canonical pathways related to cAMP response element (CREB), calcium/calmodulin kinases, bassoon, and glutamatergic signaling were robustly increased by RSD, and these were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Based on the snRNAseq data, neuronal stability and plasticity within the hippocampus were assessed. For instance, social defeat increased perineuronal nets around inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the DG, and these were influenced by both nIL-1R1 and microglia. In addition, RNAscope confirmed that bassoon RNA was amplified after social defeat in the CA1 and DG, and these increases were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Last, electrophysiological analyses showed that both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes in the DG were influenced by social defeat in a nIL-1R1-dependent manner. Collectively, sensitization of dentate gyrus neurons after social defeat requires neuronal IL-1R1 and is associated with enhanced CREB-bassoon signaling and disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory input balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/31/e2426242025?rss=1">Incorporation of a Cost of Deliberation Time in Perceptual Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many decisions benefit from the accumulation of evidence obtained sequentially over time. In such circumstances, the decision-maker must balance speed against accuracy, while considering the cost associated with the passage of time. A neural mechanism to achieve this balance is to accumulate evidence and to terminate the deliberation when enough evidence has accrued. To accommodate time costs, it has been hypothesized that the criterion to terminate a decision may become lax as a function of time. Here we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the cost of time in a perceptual choice&ndash;reaction time (RT) task. Human participants (both sexes) discriminated the direction of motion in a dynamic random-dot display, which varied in difficulty across trials. Unbeknownst to the participants, halfway through the experiment, we increased the time pressure by canceling a small fraction of trials, mimicking a broken fixation, if they had not made a decision by a provisional deadline. This subtle manipulation led participants to make faster but less accurate decisions. Choice and RT were well explained by a bounded evidence-accumulation process. We developed a novel computational method to estimate the time-dependent changes in the stopping bounds directly from the participants&rsquo; RT and choice data. Our analysis revealed that the bounds decline as a function of time, and that this decline is steeper following the time&ndash;cost manipulation. The time-varying decision bounds approximate an optimal stopping policy, although the specific bound shape is idiosyncratic across individuals.</p>

During development and tissue repair, cells reshape and reconfigure to ensure organs take specific shapes. This process is inherently three-dimensional (3D). Yet, in part due to limitations in imaging and data analysis, cell shape analysis within tissues has largely been studied in two-dimensions (2D), e.g., the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc. With recent advances in imaging and machine learning, there has been significant progress in our understanding of 3D cell and tissue shape <i>in vivo</i>. However, even after gaining 3D segmentation of cells, it remains challenging to extract cell shape metrics beyond volume and surface area for cells within densely packed tissues. To address the challenge of extracting 3D cell shape metrics from dense tissues, we have developed the Python package CellMet. This user-friendly tool enables extraction of quantitative shape information from 3D cell and tissue segmentations, including cell face properties, cell twist, and cell rearrangements in 3D. Our method will improve the analysis of 3D cell shape and the understanding of cell organisation within tissues. Our tool is open source, available at https://github.com/TimSaundersLab/CellMet.

The ventricular zone (VZ) harbors the largest neurogenic niche in the adult mammalian brain and is consisted of neural stem cells (NSCs) and multiciliated ependymal cells (EPCs). Previous lineage tracing studies showed that both NSCs and EPCs were derived from radial glial cells (RGCs). However, the transcriptomic dynamics and the molecular mechanisms guiding the cell fate commitment during the differentiation remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the developing VZ of mice at single-cell resolution and identified three distinct cellular states of RGCs: bipotent glial progenitor cells (bGPCs), neonatal NSC-neuroblasts (nNSC-NBs) and neonatal EPCs (nEPCs). The differentiation from bGPCs to nNSC-NBs and nEPCs forms a continuous bifurcating trajectory. Analysis along the NSC branch unveiled a novel intermediate state of cells expressing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) and neuroblast (NB) marker genes simultaneously. Several transcription factors (TFs) were found to be essential for the EPC-lineage differentiation. Notably, we uncovered that TFEB can tune NSC/EPC bifurcation, independent of its canonical function as a master regulator of the lysosome biogenesis. TFEB activation prevents the overproduction of EPCs by cooperating with LHX2 to balance the expressions of many multicilia-related genes while promotes the diﬀerentiation into NSC-NBs. Our results resolve the dynamic repertoire of divergent RGCs during VZ development and offer novel insights into the potential application of TFEB-targeted clinical drugs in VZ-related disorders, such as hydrocephalus and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing antemortem indicators of AD pathophysiology, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis. However, these biomarkers may not capture a frequent coincident pathology, such as cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured plasma amyloid-<i>β</i>40, amyloid-<i>β</i>42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, tau phosphorylated at threonine 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in 685 multiancestral individuals who had clinical assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The cohort was represented by individuals of European, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Participants were then classified as biomarker-positive or -negative for AD based on previously established cutoffs: 2.65 pg/mL for, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 and 0.39 pg/mL for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217. We used magnetic resonance images to compare white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), silent brain infarcts, microhemorrhages, and hippocampus volume across groups by their clinical diagnosis and biomarker status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the P-tau181 group (<i>n</i> = 685), 70 individuals (10.2%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A total of 40 (57%) were biomarker-positive for AD, and 30 were classified as other dementia. Among 615 without dementia, 265 (40.3%) were preclinical AD, and 348 (50.8%) were biomarker-negative controls. In the tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 group (<i>n</i> = 535), 54 (10.1%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, including 33 biomarker-positive for AD and 21 with other dementia, whereas 183 (38.0%) were preclinical AD and 298 (61.9%) were biomarker-negative controls. Across both classifications, biomarker-positive for AD and other dementia individuals showed greater WMH volumes, more infarcts, and smaller hippocampus. However, P-tau217 positivity was more sensitive to WMH volume differences, whereas tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 better captured hippocampal atrophy and silent brain infarcts. Interestingly, ethnic differences may also influence detection of changes in WMH volumes, hippocampal volume, and infarcts in relation to specific biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate that cerebrovascular disease is consistently involved in dementia either directly or as a coincident pathology in AD. These results underscore the need to incorporate both blood-based biomarkers and structural imaging in the evaluation of patients with dementia. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the first regions targeted by pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) indicating a potential for metrics from this region to serve as imaging biomarkers. Leveraging a unique post-mortem dataset of histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, we aimed to (1) develop an anatomically valid segmentation protocol for anterior entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann area (BA) 35, and BA36 for in vivo 3 T MRI and (2) incorporate this protocol in an automated approach. We included 20 cases (61–97 years old, 50% females) with and without neurodegenerative diseases (11 vs. 9 cases) to ensure generalizability of the developed protocol. Digitized MTL Nissl-stained coronal histology sections from these cases were annotated and registered to same-subject post-mortem MRI. The protocol was developed by determining the location of histological borders of the MTL cortices in relation to anatomical landmarks. Subsequently, the protocol was applied to 15 cases twice, with a 2-week interval, to assess intra-rater reliability with the Dice Similarity Index (DSI). Thereafter, it was implemented in our in-house Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS)-T1 approach and evaluated with DSIs. The anterior histological border distances of ERC, BA35 and BA36 were evaluated with respect to various anatomical landmarks, and the distance relative to the beginning of the hippocampus was chosen. To formulate segmentation rules, we examined the histological sections for the location of borders in relationship to anatomical landmarks in the coronal sections. The DSI for the anterior MTL cortices for the intra-rater reliability was 0.85–0.88, and for the ASHS-T1 against the manual segmentation, it was 0.62–0.65. We developed a reliable segmentation protocol and incorporated it in an automated approach. Given the vulnerability of the anterior MTL cortices to tau deposition in AD and LATE, the updated approach is expected to improve imaging biomarkers for these diseases.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the hippocampus, there is a region- and synapse-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist preference for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses, enriched in GluN2A-containing NMDARs, favor D-serine, while medial perforant path (MPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses that are rich in GluN2B-containing NMDARs prefer glycine for LTP induction. This study investigated the role of astrocytes in providing these co-agonists. We confirmed in rat hippocampal slices that exogenous D-serine (10 μM) is sufficient to restore LTP at SC-CA1 synapses blocked under astrocyte calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) -clamp conditions, consistent with previous findings. However, exogenous glycine (10 μM) also rescued the LTP. In contrast, at MPP-DG synapses, 100 μM exogenous glycine, but not 10 μM nor 100 μM D-serine, restored the LTP blocked by astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>-clamping. Our findings support the view that, as for serine in CA1, astrocytes are the cellular source of the glycine required for LTP induction at MPP-DG synapses.</p>

                In long-lived mammals, including humans, brain cell homeostasis is critical for maintaining brain function throughout life. Most neurons are generated during development and must maintain their cellular identity and plasticity to preserve brain function. Although extensive studies indicate the importance of recycling and regenerating cellular molecules to maintain cellular homeostasis, recent evidence has shown that some proteins and RNAs do not turn over for months and even years. We propose that these long-lived cellular molecules may be the basis for maintaining brain function in the long term, but also a potential convergent target of brain aging. We highlight key discoveries and challenges, and propose potential directions to unravel the mystery of brain cell longevity.

                Tangled molecular, cellular, and dynamic undercurrents shape brain organization. An emerging paradigm across neuroscience domains is to comprehensively measure the spatial patterning of multiple biological features, yielding precise brain maps. How can these features be conceptually integrated into a coherent understanding of brain structure and function? Here we review the methodology and practice of interpreting relationships between maps of biological features. We demonstrate how neuroscience can increasingly be approached as a data science, complete with detailed multiomic datasets, tools for representing diverse data types, and an extensive repertoire of analytics. We also outline methodological and conceptual challenges for disentangling relationships among brain maps. Ultimately, studying the brain from an integrative perspective changes the nature of scientific questions that can be asked, as well as the culture and conduct of scientific inquiry.

Biane et al. examine how positive and negative experiences are encoded by vHPC ensembles, showing that vCA1 does not contain generalized representations of valence but rather discriminates salient stimuli based on their identity and sensory features.

These pro-inflammatory proteins confer a selective advantage to the leukemia-initiating cells and contribute to immune evasion.

                p53 signaling is frequently dampened in cancer. 53BP1 binds p53 and enhances p53 target gene expression. Galarreta et al. identify CNOT1 of the CCR4-NOT complex as a regulator of 53BP1-p53 signaling and show that CNOT1 depletion boosts p53 target gene expression, selectively compromises cancer cell survival, and rescues mutant p53 functions.

                Khandagale et al. show that topoisomerase IIIα (TOP3A) is required for maintaining telomere stability in ALT cancer cells. Either the loss of TOP3A or the induction of TOP3A cleavage complexes (break-associated DNA-protein crosslinks) destabilize the shelterin complex and TERRA R-loops at telomeres.

                Expanded CAG repeats, the cause of Huntington’s disease, stall replication and reposition to the nuclear periphery to effect repair. Maclay et al. report that the DNA replication checkpoint targets the kinetochore protein Cep3 for phosphorylation, which results in centromere release and repeat locus association with damage-inducible microtubules to promote relocation.

                The hippocampal CA3 recurrent network is important for memory storage. Watson et al. show that in mouse CA3, heterogeneous pyramidal neurons form subclasses with different somatic locations (deep and superficial), non-random recurrent wiring, and apparent subclass-specific inhibition. These properties complexify hippocampal activity flow, potentially increasing the circuit’s computational power.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101244">PA28γ promotes the malignant progression of tumor by elevating mitochondrial function via C1QBP</a></h4>

              
                Proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) plays a critical role in malignant progression of various tumors, however, its role and regulation are not well understood. Here, using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as the main research model, and combining co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), proximity ligation assays (PLA), AlphaFold 3-based molecular docking, and truncation constructs, we discovered that PA28γ interacted with complement 1q binding protein (C1QBP). This interaction is dependent on the C1QBP N-terminus (aa 1–167) rather than the known functional domain. Point mutation in C1QBP (T76A/G78N) disrupting predicted hydrogen bonding with PA28γ-D177 significantly reduced their binding. Notably, we found that PA28γ enhances C1QBP protein stability in OSCC. Functionally, PA28γ and C1QBP co-localized in mitochondria, promoting fusion (via upregulation of OPA1, MFN1/2), respiratory complex expression, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP production, and ROS generation. Crucially, PA28γ-enhanced OSCC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro were dependent on C1QBP. In vivo, orthotopic OSCC models showed Pa28γ overexpression increased tumor growth and elevated C1qbp levels, correlating with elevated ATP and ROS. Using transgenic <i>Psme3</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and subcutaneous tumor grafts, we confirmed that silencing of Pa28γ suppresses tumor growth, reduces C1qbp levels, and dampens mitochondrial metabolism—specifically in knockout hosts. Clinically, PA28γ and C1QBP expression were positively correlated during oral carcinogenesis and in metastatic OSCC tissues across cohorts. High co-expression predicted poor prognosis in OSCC patients. Thus, PA28γ stabilizes C1QBP via N-terminal interaction to drive mitochondrial OXPHOS and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104972">A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of <i>C. elegans</i> can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that do not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the time interval probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they are not necessarily indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.

">Slow synaptic plasticity from the hippocampus underlies gradual mapping and fragmentation of novel spaces by grid cells</a></h4>

              
                Animals construct internal "cognitive maps" of the world during navigation in spatial and non-spatial domains, with grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) playing a key role. This requires associating internal position estimates with external cues to reduce spatial uncertainty over time. However, how grid cell representations evolve in novel spaces to support map formation is unclear. To address this question, we longitudinally record grid cells with two-photon calcium imaging over 10 days as mice learn operant tasks in novel virtual linear tracks. We observe that spatial tuning of grid cells is present immediately in novel tracks but evolves as a significant fraction of spatial fields shift backward on a run-by-run basis, within and across days. Backward shifts are more prevalent and persistent in successful learners. The fields gradually stabilize across days, anchored by landmarks, suggesting a slow plasticity mechanism that results in an increasingly fragmented and stable map. The backward shifts partially reset daily, reflecting a slower consolidation timescale. We show that though individual fields of a cell shift differentially, co-active fields of co-modular grid cells shift together, indicating their coupled dynamics keep them on the same two-dimensional torus during this plastic period. Next, we build a simple entorhinal-hippocampal model that explains the diverse phenomena-grid field shifts, fragmentation, and increasing fidelity of the spatial map-and predicts slow Hebbian plasticity in the return hippocampal-to-entorhinal pathway. Finally, using ex vivo slice electrophysiology, we show that plasticity in an indirect hippocampus-to-MEC pathway correlates with spatial learning performance and could account for the hypothesized slow plasticity of the model. Together, our study provides multifaceted evidence of slow plasticity in synapses from the hippocampus to the MEC, elucidating the formation of stable and fragmented maps that combine internal and cue-driven positional estimates in rich environments, elucidating cognitive map formation during spatial learning.

">The atypical adhesion GPCR ADGRA1 controls hippocampal inhibitory circuit function</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits contain a diverse array of inhibitory interneurons that control information processing. The cell surface receptors and signaling pathways that modulate cell type specific inhibitory synaptic function are unclear. Here, we identify the atypical adhesion GPCR ADGRA1 as essential for hippocampal PV and SST inhibitory synaptic function. ADGRA1 is selectively enriched in hippocampal PV and SST interneurons and localizes to a subset of synapses. ADGRA1 deletion in PV and SST interneurons impairs inhibitory synaptic inputs onto Dentate Gyrus granule cells and generates deficits in learning and memory. ADGRA1 engages several downstream G proteins, notably G13, a pathway important for the establishment of hippocampal PV interneuron synaptic networks. These results identify an orphan receptor pathway selective for specific inhibitory synapse subtypes and expand our understanding of the signaling mechanisms that establish hippocampal inhibitory circuits.

">Complementary BOLD- and ADC-fMRI explore the role of lateral superior colliculus in flicker fusion frequency</a></h4>

              
                The transition from static to dynamic vision is encoded in the superior colliculus, as recently shown using blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) of the rat brain. Visual stimulation at higher frequency than the flicker fusion frequency threshold leads to continuity illusion and is associated with negative BOLD response in the visual cortex, triggered by the superior colliculus. In this paper, we explored this mechanism using fMRI of the rat brain with visual stimulation at low (1Hz) and high (25Hz) frequency. We compared responses between different brain regions (the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, the medial and lateral parts of the superior colliculus, and the visual cortex), sexes, and field strengths (9.4T and 14T, with varying contributions from large vessels). Results confirmed distinct neural responses to low and high frequency stimulation and highlighted the role of the lateral part of the superior colliculus in the transition from static to dynamic vision. Finally, we evaluated the ability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-fMRI to detect response to visual stimulation without vascular contribution. We found significant ADC-fMRI response in the medial and lateral parts of the superior colliculus but also in the corpus callosum. Our results highlight the ADC-fMRI high spatial specificity and high sensitivity to white matter.

">Sex-specific effects of chronic unpredictable stress on mitochondrial function in the HPA axis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Stress, whether real or perceived, activates physiological and behavioral responses via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system activation. Under chronic stress, however, these adaptive responses become dysfunctional leading to pathological changes in behavior and health. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles essential for cellular energy production and for initiating glucocorticoid synthesis and release from adrenal glands during stress. Thus, mitochondria may represent a first line of response to environmental challenges. However, the effects of chronic stress on mitochondrial function within the HPA axis, particularly regarding sex differences, are unexplored. We exposed adult male and female C57BL6/J mice to four weeks of chronic unpredictable stress and examined behavioral and mitochondrial responses in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands -- two key HPA axis regions. As previous reports indicated sex differences in stress responsivity, we hypothesized that chronic stress would differentially impact mitochondrial respiration within HPA axis regions in a sex-specific manner. Chronic stress increased avoidance behavior in males and passive coping behavior in females, indicating sex-specific behavioral responses. In females, stress significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration in both the hypothalamus and adrenal glands, while males were not significantly affected. In males, stress increased adrenal expression of mitochondrial complex II protein, which may have served a compensatory role to preserve mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration significantly correlated with behavioral measures in stressed animals, highlighting a relationship between metabolism and stress-induced impairments. These findings reveal sex-specific metabolic adaptations to chronic stress and suggest that females may be more vulnerable to stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction within the HPA axis.

">Amyloid precursor protein dosage normalization rescues neurogenesis and Alzheimer's Disease phenotypes associated with Down Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Down Syndrome (DS) is the most abundant genetic form of mental retardation. It is caused by the triplication of partial or complete human chromosome 21 (HSA21). The molecular mechanisms causing it are not fully understood. Previous studies identified ''Down syndrome Critical Region'' (DSCR) genes that are essential or sufficient for the development of DS. However, these studies are largely inconclusive, due, in part, to the reliance on a small number of epidemiological cases. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) resides on HSA21 and is triplicated in DS. APP plays a role in developmental and post-natal neurogenesis, but is not thought to be part of the DSCR. The role of APP overdose in cortical malformation and cognitive impairments in DS is unknown. Mutations in APP cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). However, whether APP overdose is sufficient for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in DS is not fully understood. Here, we addressed the role of APP overdose in neuronal development and AD pathology. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we eliminated one copy of APP from Down Syndrome-derived induced iPSCs DS APP(+/+/-) and examined the effect on neurogenesis, AD-related pathology and the expression levels of genes on HSA21 that are implicated in DS, neurodegeneration and inflammation.

                We utilize periodic structured illumination with pseudo-HiLo (pHiLo) image reconstruction for in vivo voltage imaging. We demonstrate reduced signal from out-of-focus cells, that contaminates voltage activity for in-focus cells of interest, with pHiLo compared to traditional widefield recordings taken with uniform illumination and pseudo-widefield (pWF) reconstructions. We discuss tradeoffs between signal-to-background ratio, signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for pHiLo in the context of high-speed voltage imaging in awake mice.

">Precision fMRI reveals densely interdigitated network patches with conserved motifs in the lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Dominant models of human lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) organization emphasize broad domain-general zones and smooth functional gradients. However, these models rely heavily on group-averaged neuroimaging, which can obscure fine-scale cortical features - especially in highly inter-individually variable regions like the LPFC. To address this limitation, we collected a new precision fMRI dataset from 10 individuals, each with approximately 2 hours of resting-state and 6 hours of task data. We mapped individual-specific LPFC networks using resting-state fMRI and tested network-level functional preferences using task fMRI. We found that individual LPFC organization differed markedly from group-average estimates. Individual maps showed more fragmented and interdigitated networks - especially in anterior LPFC - including novel conserved motifs present across individuals. Task fMRI revealed that distinct but adjacent networks support domain-specific processes (i.e., language, social cognition, episodic projection) versus domain-general control. Sharp functional boundaries were visible at the individual level that could not be observed in group data. These findings uncover previously hidden organizational principles in the LPFC and offer a framework for understanding how the LPFC supports flexible, complex cognition through a finely organized architecture.

">Functional Brain Mapping of Body Size Estimation Using a 3D Avatar</a></h4>

              
                Background: Body size estimation, the ability to judge the size and shape of one's own body, is a key perceptual component of body image. However, its neural basis, and the basis for inter-individual differences in accuracy, remain poorly understood, partly due to limitations in existing assessment tools. Methods: We developed Somatomap 3D, an interactive fMRI-compatible task allowing participants to manipulate a rotatable 3D avatar by adjusting the size and shape of 26 individual body parts to match their perceived body. Twenty-eight healthy male and female adults completed the task during fMRI. Brain activity in a priori regions of interest from previous studies of body processing was modeled using a general linear model incorporating event-specific parameters and parametric modulators related to task performance. Inter-individual differences in body size estimation accuracy were calculated using multidimensional scaling of body part estimation errors, and scores were correlated with BOLD signal eigenvariates from regions of interest. Results: Task engagement was associated with significant activation in hypothesized body-selective and multisensory regions, including bilateral extrastriate body area, right fusiform body area, right superior parietal lobule, and bilateral premotor cortex. Multidimensional scaling identified a primary subdimension reflecting distortions in body part girths, which was significantly associated with neural responses in the superior parietal lobule. No other brain regions showed significant associations with inter-individual differences in estimation accuracy. Conclusions: These results suggest that body size estimation engages a distributed network of visual, motor, and parietal regions. Among these, only the superior parietal lobule showed a significant association with inter-individual variation in body size estimation accuracy for body part girths, supporting its role as a candidate neural substrate for altered body representation in psychiatric conditions such as eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder.

">Short-term memory capacity and chronic stress levels predict cognitive effort choice as a function of reward level and effort demand</a></h4>

              
                Every day, we make choices about how much effort we are willing and able to use to achieve the outcomes we desire against the backdrop of constantly shifting effort demands and available rewards. While factors like visual short-term memory and chronic stress levels can predict responses to stable cognitive effort demands, we do not yet know whether they constrain one's choices of higher effort trials for larger rewards when task demands and potential outcomes shift over time. Here, we examined whether these factors predicted the choice to deploy cognitive effort given increasing effort demands and the tendency to deploy effort given shifting reward availability. Undergraduate participants first performed an online visual short-term memory task to assess capacity for visuospatial short-term memory. They then completed a series of choice trials where they could choose between high-effort, high-reward or low-effort, low-reward trials. In two blocks, we varied either the effort required on high-effort trials or the reward offered on both trial types. We found that visual short-term memory predicted the likelihood of choosing high-effort trials given shifting rewards, while chronic stress and everyday preferences for cognitively effortful strategies predicted the tendency to deploy increasing amounts of effort for a stable reward. Furthermore, participants' subjective reports show a strong focus on attentional processes, and balancing rewards and losses, when making decisions about how much effort to deploy. These findings shed light on distinct trait-level factors associated with cognitive effort choices given shifting demands and outcomes.

                Leading theories suggest that hippocampal replay drives offline learning through coupling with an internal teaching signal such as ventral striatal dopamine (DA); however, the relationship between hippocampal replay and dopamine is unknown. Simultaneous recording of putative hippocampal replay events (dorsal CA1 sharp-wave ripples, SWRs) and fiber photometry of ventral striatal DA in mice revealed a significant increase in DA following SWRs, peaking ~0.3 s after SWRs. This result establishes for the first time a core theoretical requirement of offline learning in the mammalian brain.

">Low-frequency brain oscillations reflect the dynamics of the oculomotor system: a new perspective on subsequent memory effects</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity and eye movements are two well-established predictors of memory performance in humans. Successful memory formation is typically associated with reduced alpha/beta power (i.e., the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect) and an increased number of eye movements. However, the functional relevance of these two memory correlates has primarily been investigated in isolation, leaving their coupling and combined contribution to memory formation largely unknown. Here, we address this gap through four experiments involving simultaneous eye-tracking and scalp or intracranial electroencephalography recordings while participants viewed scenes either freely or under varying levels of visual constraint. Across experiments and cohorts, we identified the degree of visual exploration, rather than subsequent memory performance, as the consistent and robust modulator of alpha/beta power reductions. Moreover, we show that saccade parameters predicted the dynamics of alpha/beta activity, and that the accumulation of saccades over time accounted for the reduced alpha/beta power. Our work demonstrates that neglecting eye movements results in an incomplete understanding of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect. Together, the evidence points at alpha/beta activity directly reflecting eye movements, and only indirectly, memory formation. The current study thus bridges two lines of previous research and advocates for new perspectives on the specific interpretation of the alpha/beta subsequent memory effect and on the function of alpha/beta activity in general.

">Vision and touch used for catching small balls with a power grip and large balls with a precision grip supports dual visuomotor channel theory</a></h4>

              
                The dual visuomotor channel theory of grasping posits that distinct neural pathways mediate hand shaping in response to a target's extrinsic (e.g., location) and intrinsic (e.g., size and shape) properties. To evaluate this theory, we examined grasp behavior in human participants as they caught balls of four diameters (2.5 to 9 cm) thrown toward them. Hand shaping during catching was compared with that observed during the pickup of stationary balls and the interception of rolling balls. Kinematic measures included digit opposition distance (thumb pad to index finger pad) and prehension span (digit pad to palm distance), obtained using electromagnetic sensors, 3D video capture, and frame-by-frame video analysis. Participants displayed significantly greater hand opening when catching thrown balls than when interacting with static or rolling balls. Nonetheless, the maximum pregrasp aperture (MPA), contact grasp aperture (CGA), and terminal grasp aperture (TGA) scaled proportionally with ball size across all conditions. Ball size further influenced grasp type: small thrown balls were caught with power grips, while larger balls were caught with precision grips. In contrast, precision grips were used consistently when picking up stationary balls or grasping intercepting rolling ones. In the catching condition, grasp type and the trajectory of digit closure were also affected by the location of ball to hand contact. These findings support the dual visuomotor channel theory by demonstrating that anticipatory hand opening reflects target location, whereas grip selection reflects target size. Moreover, the modulation of grasp type and digit closure by tactile contact suggests that somatosensory input may operate within a dual-channel framework analogous to that of vision.

">Minimal Impact of Low Vision on Explicit Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Rehabilitation from motor system dysfunction relies on learning deliberate motor corrections through practice and feedback. This is called explicit motor adaptation. One key source of feedback for this adaptation is the visual error signal between the intended movement and the achieved movement. As people age, both motor dysfunction and visual impairment become more common, potentially compromising the visual feedback signal. Previous work has shown that visual impairment can disrupt the implicit, automatic adjustments made by the sensorimotor system. But how visual impairment influences the explicit motor adaptation, a cornerstone of rehabilitation, remains unknown. To address this gap, we recruited individuals with low vision - defined as uncorrectable visual impairment resulting in functional vision loss - and age-matched controls to complete a visuomotor task designed to isolate two components of explicit motor adaptation: discovering a new deliberate sensorimotor strategy and recalling a previously learned one. Surprisingly, low vision had no measurable impact on either component. Despite reduced visual fidelity, individuals with low vision were as effective as controls in both discovering and retrieving successful explicit sensorimotor strategies. These results highlight potential mechanisms that can be leveraged in rehabilitation.

">Recurrent connectivity supports carbon dioxide sensitivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                The mosquito Aedes aegypti's human host-seeking behavior depends on the integration of multiple sensory cues. One of these cues, carbon dioxide (CO2), gates odorant and heat pathways and activates host-seeking behavior. The neuronal circuits underlying processing of CO2 information remain unclear. We used automated serial-section transmission electron microscopy (EM) to image and reconstruct the circuitry of the glomeruli that are innervated by the Ae. aegypti maxillary palp, including the glomerulus that responds to CO2. Notably, CO2-sensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) make high levels of recurrent synaptic connections with one another, while making a low density of feedforward synapses. At some of these contacts between CO2 OSNs, we observe ribbon-like presynaptic structures, which may further enhance recurrent signaling. We compared both feedforward and recurrent connectivity with all olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster, and we found more recurrent connections between the Ae. aegypti CO2-responsive OSNs than in any D. melanogaster glomeruli. We developed a computational circuit model that demonstrates recurrent synapses are necessary for robust CO2 detection under normal physiological conditions. Together, elevated levels of recurrent connectivity and ribbon-like structures may amplify sensory information detected by CO2-sensitive OSNs to support mosquito activation and sensitization by CO2, even in the presence of high levels of other odorants in the environment. We propose that this circuit organization supports the salience of CO2 as a mosquito host cue.

">The Alzheimer's-Associated SORL1 p.Y1816C Variant Impairs APP Sorting, Axonal Trafficking, and Neuronal Activity in iPSC-Derived Brain Models</a></h4>

              
                Background: SORL1, encoding the sorting receptor SORLA, is now recognized as the fourth autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene. Loss of SORLA function is known to disrupt endosomal trafficking and enhance amyloidogenic APP processing, two key aspects of the onset and progression of AD. However, the pathogenic consequences of disrupted endolysosomal pathways, deregulated protein sorting, as well as the effects of specific SORL1 missense variants on human neuronal function, still remain understudied. Methods: Our investigations were performed using two complementary human iPSC-derived models: 2D NGN2-induced neurons and 3D cerebral organoids established from isogenic wild-type (WT), SORL1 p.Y1816C (KI) missense variant, and SORL1 knock-out (KO) cells. We analyzed SORLA maturation and ectodomain shedding, APP localization, and amyloid-{beta} secretion. Endosomal morphology and neuritic swellings were assessed via electron microscopy, while axonal transport of APP and Rab5+ endosomes was evaluated through live-cell imaging. Neuronal network activity was measured using multielectrode array recordings. Results: Our results demonstrate that the p.Y1816C variant leads to impaired SORLA maturation and reduced shedding, without affecting neuronal or organoid differentiation. Notably, we show an ultrastructure of endosomes, including their content, and demonstrate that both KO and KI models exhibit early endosome enlargement, increased APP retention in endosomes, elevated A{beta}40/42 secretion, and amyloid-{beta} deposition in 3D organoids. Importantly, we identified previously uncharacterized functional consequences of abolished SORLA activity, including axonal swellings and significantly impaired transport of Rab5+ endosomes and APP, characterized by deregulated velocities, directionality of transport, and increased stalling. Additionally, we discovered that both KO and p.Y1816C KI neurons exhibit abnormal electrophysiological activity, including increased spontaneous firing, burst frequency, and network synchrony. Conclusions: Our study defines the mechanistic consequences of the SORL1 p.Y1816C variant and demonstrates its pathogenicity in human neurons. Importantly, we also identify novel roles for SORLA in maintaining axonal transport homeostasis and regulating neuronal excitability, expanding its functional relevance beyond endosomal APP processing. These findings reinforce the central role of endosomal trafficking disruption in AD and support the use of isogenic human models for evaluating AD risk variants.

">MeCP2 regulates cell type-specific functions of depressive-like symptoms in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                MeCP2 (methyl CpG binding protein 2) is a transcriptional regulator that modulates gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Although recent studies have implicated MeCP2 in stress responses and depression, its precise role is not completely understood. In this study, we identify a cell type-specific function of MeCP2 in the regulation of depression-like symptoms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region for emotional and stress processing. We observed differential MeCP2 expression in distinct cell populations of the NAc following chronic restraint stress (CRS) and investigated the behavioral and electrophysiological consequences of cell type-specific MeCP2 manipulation. We also explored the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 alleviates depression-like symptoms in the NAc and associated neural circuit regions through cell type-specific profiling of the spatial transcriptome. Our findings demonstrate that MeCP2 contributes to synaptic and circuit-level regulation in a cell type-specific manner within the NAc and ultimately mitigates CRS-induced depression-like behaviors.

">Disruption of Reelin signaling in a dual-hit mouse model of schizophrenia: impact of postnatal Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure in a maternal immune activation model</a></h4>

              
                Since the discovery of the first antipsychotic, pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia (SCZ) has primarily relied on agents that block D2 dopamine receptors. However, due to variability in patient responses, there is a pressing need to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In this context, we have developed a dual-hit mouse model that combines maternal immune activation (MIA) induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) and postnatal exposure to {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. We assessed the face validity of this model and investigated potential alterations in the Reelin signaling pathway. Our findings show a reduction in Reelin levels, a new potential key biomarker of SCZ, in the prefrontal cortex of male mice treated with THC compared to the dual-hit group, and across all treatment groups compared to controls in females. Additionally, a decrease in the number of Reelin+ cells was observed across these groups. The dual-hit model exhibited phenotypes indicative of positive symptoms in males, as well as phenotypes associated with negative symptoms in both sexes. Furthermore, the model demonstrated reduced cortical thickness in THC-treated groups, alongside decreased dendritic spine density in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the dual-hit group.

">NanoString Technologies Neuropathology Panel Produces Unreliable Measurements of Mouse Hippocampal Gene Expression</a></h4>

              
                Technologies for measuring gene expression (i.e., the number of RNA transcripts) of large numbers of genes simultaneously in specific tissues have exploded in recent years. Current methods include high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), transcript counting platforms like NanoStrings nCounter, and spatially resolved techniques based on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Several studies have evaluated the reliability of these different methods and performance in comparison to one another. Typically, technical reliability, as measured by Pearsons correlation of two measurements of the same sample, is usually well above 90%, and is statistically significant even for small sample sizes (e.g., 8 samples measured twice). We performed an experiment where we aimed to compare hippocampal gene expression between 3 groups (n=5 per group) of young adult male C57BL/6J mice. Before sampling, the groups were treated with either repeated injections of PBS (vehicle), extracellular vesicles taken from the blood plasma of sedentary mice (SedVs) or exercising mice (ExerVs). The hippocampus was dissected, and RNA purified using standard methods. The samples were analyzed using the NanoString Neuropathology panel, that measures 770 genes simultaneously. To estimate reliability, we measured 8 of the samples twice in two separate assays. Surprisingly, only 85 genes showed a significant Pearsons correlation (p<0.05), and none of these met false discovery significance (all q<0.05). To confirm that no errors were made transferring labels, the individual samples were permuted to see whether a different assignment could recover a greater number of positive correlations. Results showed that the original assignment was best suggesting no errors in sample assignments were made. We conclude that the Nanostring neuropathology panel produces unreliable data for mouse hippocampal gene expression.

">Norepinephrine stimulates protein synthesis in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator that can activate multiple subcellular signalling pathways to regulate various physiological responses in different cell types. In astrocytes, it is known to have a wide range of metabolic effects, including regulation of glucose uptake and glycolysis, glycogen breakdown and lactate production. Here we report that norepinephrine stimulates protein synthesis in rat primary cortical astrocytes and the C6 glioma cell line. The mTOR-pS6K pathway is engaged during the norepinephrine-mediated induction of protein synthesis, which is abolished by mTOR inhibition and appears to be mediated mainly by {beta}-adrenergic receptors. We show that blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxy-D-glucose inhibits both basal and norepinephrine-induced translation in astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that the norepinephrine-mediated increase in protein synthesis is preceded by a decrease in astrocytic ATP levels. Our results reveal a novel regulatory role for norepinephrine in the central nervous system, tightly controlling protein synthesis in astrocytes.

">A spinal origin for the obligate flexor synergy in the non-human primate: Implications for control of reaching</a></h4>

              
                Stroke survivors frequently develop the flexor synergy, an obligate co-contraction of shoulder abductors and elbow flexors; the neural substrate has proven elusive. Here we trained healthy monkeys to generate isometric elbow and shoulder torques to move an on-screen cursor, and recorded neuron firing from motor cortical areas and the reticular formation. In all regions we found cells correlated with activity around a single joint. Neurons coding co-contractions showed a bias towards combinations orthogonal to the post-stroke flexor synergy, e.g. shoulder abduction with elbow extension. Threshold microstimulation in the spinal cord but not in either motor cortex or the reticular formation generated coactivation aligned to the flexor synergy. We suggest the evolution of prehension required descending systems either to control or bypass locomotion-dedicated spinal circuits. Loss of descending input after stroke constrains the upper limb to spinal synergies best suited to primitive locomotor functions.

">Engineering substantia nigra-like dopaminergic neurons in human midbrain organoids through WNT modulation and bioreactor culture</a></h4>

              
                Human midbrain organoids (hMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells represent a promising model for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, current protocols often fall short in producing mature, regionally specified dopaminergic (DA) neurons that faithfully recapitulate disease-relevant vulnerabilities. Here, we present a differentiation strategy combining tri-phasic WNT signaling modulation with dynamic bioreactor culture to enhance DA neuron yield, regional identity, and functional maturation within hMOs. This approach generated DA neurons with enriched substantia nigra-like features, increased dopamine release, and robust electrophysiological activity. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of synaptic, metabolic, and neuroprotective pathways, alongside reduced expression of stress and pro-apoptotic signatures in DA neurons. Importantly, these hMOs demonstrated vulnerability upon exposure to alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils and proteinase K-resistant aggregates, effectively modeling PD-associated pathology. Altogether, our platform offers a scalable and physiologically relevant system for investigating PD mechanisms, enabling therapeutic screening, and supporting the advancement of cell replacement strategies.

">Metabolic and behavioral effects of neurofibromin result from differential recruitment of MAPK and mTOR signaling</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 gene and its encoded neurofibromin protein. This condition produces multiple symptoms, including tumors, behavioral alterations, and metabolic changes. Molecularly, neurofibromin mutations affect Ras activity, influencing multiple downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. This pleiotropy raises the question of which pathways could be targeted to treat the disease symptoms, and whether different phenotypes driven by neurofibromin mutations exhibit similar or diverging dependence on the signaling pathways downstream of Ras. To test this, we examined metabolic and behavioral alterations in the genetically tractable Drosophila neurofibromatosis type 1 model. In vivo genetic analysis revealed that behavioral effects of neurofibromin were mediated by MEK signaling, with no necessity for Akt. In contrast, metabolic effects of neurofibromin were mediated by coordinated actions of MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR/S6K/4E-BP signaling. At the systemic level, neurofibromin dysregulated metabolism via molecular effects of Nf1 in interneurons and muscle. These changes were accompanied by altered muscle mitochondria morphology, with no concomitant changes in neuronal ultrastructure or neuronal mitochondria. Overall, this suggests that neurofibromin mutations affect multiple signaling cascades down-stream of Ras, which differentially affect metabolic and behavioral neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotypes.

">UBR-1 enzyme network regulates glutamate homeostasis to affect organismal behavior and developmental viability</a></h4>

              
                Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS) is an autosomal recessive spectrum disorder associated with the UBR-1 ubiquitin ligase that features developmental delay including motor abnormalities. Here, we demonstrate that C. elegans UBR-1 regulates high-intensity locomotor behavior and developmental viability via both ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding mechanisms. Super-resolution imaging with CRISPR-engineered UBR-1 and genetic results demonstrated that UBR-1 is expressed and functions in the nervous system including in pre-motor interneurons. To decipher mechanisms of UBR-1 function, we deployed CRISPR-based proteomics using C. elegans which identified a cadre of glutamate metabolic enzymes physically associated with UBR-1 including GLN-3, GOT-2.2, GFAT-1 and GDH-1. Similar to UBR-1, all four glutamate enzymes are genetically linked to human developmental and neurological deficits. Proteomics, multi-gene interaction studies, and pharmacological findings indicated that UBR-1, GLN-3 and GOT-2.2 form a signaling axis that regulates glutamate homeostasis. Developmentally, UBR-1 is expressed in embryos and functions with GLN-3 to regulate viability. Overall, our results suggest UBR-1 is an enzyme hub in a GOT-2.2/UBR-1/GLN-3 axis that maintains glutamate homeostasis required for efficient locomotion and organismal viability. Given the prominent role of glutamate within and outside the nervous system, the UBR-1 glutamate homeostatic network we have identified could contribute to JBS etiology.

">Motor prediction reduces beta-band power and enhances cerebellar-somatosensory connectivity before self-touch to enable its attenuation</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing theories suggest that the brain uses an internal forward model to predict tactile input during voluntary movements, thereby reducing the intensity of the reafferent tactile sensation, a phenomenon known as self-touch attenuation. Although self-touch attenuation is a well-documented effect, it remains unclear how prediction-related neural mechanisms drive the attenuation prior to the actual self-touch input. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the neural correlates of self-touch prediction. Participants performed a self-touch task with two control conditions. In one control, the touch was externally generated without any movement. In the other, the moving and the touched hands were spatially misaligned, thereby disrupting the sensorimotor alignment of self-touch. Self-touch evoked weaker early somatosensory activity (M50 component) than both control conditions. A psychophysics task also mirrored the pattern of neural attenuation, as the perception of self-touch was attenuated compared to the two control conditions. To isolate predictive neural mechanisms from general movement-related activity, we subtracted activity from corresponding stimulus-absent trials. To further refine the signal specific to predictive processing in self-touch, we compared self-touch with misaligned touch, the two conditions that both involved voluntary movement but differed in their prediction of self-touch. This revealed greater pre-stimulus beta-band desynchronization and increased cerebellar-to-somatosensory connectivity prior to self-touch compared to misaligned touch. Our results provide the first evidence of predictive neural activity that shapes the sensory consequences of self-touch, offering insight into the mechanisms through which predictive models modulate somatosensory processing.

">Striatal pathways oppositely shift cortical activity along the decision axis</a></h4>

              
                The cortex and basal ganglia are organized into multiple parallel loops that serve motor, limbic, and cognitive functions. The classic model of cortico-basal ganglia interactions posits that within each loop, the direct pathway of the basal ganglia activates the cortex and the indirect pathway inhibits it. While this model has found support in the motor domain, whether opponent control by the two pathways extends to the cognitive domain remains unknown. Here, we record from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) while inhibiting direct or indirect pathway neurons in DMS, as mice perform an accumulation-of-evidence task. Inconsistent with the classic model, the manipulations do not produce opponent changes in overall ACC activity. Instead, the pathways exert opponent influence over a subpopulation of ACC neurons that encode accumulated sensory evidence, the task-relevant decision variable. The direction of the modulation depends on a neurons tuning to ipsilateral versus contralateral evidence, such that the two pathways generate opponent shifts in coding specifically along the decision axis. Thus, our results uncover unexpected specificity in the effects of basal ganglia pathways on the cortex, with the two pathways of the DMS exerting opponent control not on overall activity but on coding of the relevant task variable. This functional specificity may extend to other basal ganglia loops to support different aspects of adaptive behavior, with the pathways serving a general role in selecting and shifting cortical representations to subserve circuit-specific functions.

">Glucose Metabolism echoes Long-Range Temporal Correlations in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by pervasive long-range temporal correlations. While these scale-invariant dynamics are a fundamental hallmark of brain function, their implications for individual-level metabolic regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by integrating resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and dynamic [18F]FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data acquired from the same cohort of participants. We uncover a systematic relationship between long-range temporal correlations, quantified via the Hurst exponent, and glucose metabolism. Our findings reveal that persistent temporal dependencies impose a measurable metabolic cost, with brains exhibiting higher long-range temporal correlations incurring greater energetic demands. Beyond glucose metabolism, we also show that these dynamics are likely supported by continuous biosynthetic processes, such as protein synthesis, which are critical for neural circuit maintenance and remodeling. Overall, our results suggest that a significant fraction of the brain's so-called "Dark Energy" is actively spent to power spontaneous long-range temporal correlations.

">Hippocampal Synchrony Dynamically Gates Cortical Connectivity Across Brain States</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation is thought to rely on hippocampo-cortical dialogue orchestrated by three cardinal sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations, thalamic spindles, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. However, how hippocampal outputs are routed to specific cortical targets and dynamically regulated across brain states remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed simultaneous multisite recordings from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and frontal and parietal cortex in rats alternating between wakefulness and sleep. Frontal slow oscillations operated as a global clock, resetting thalamic circuits and initiating spindle volleys that propagated from anterior to posterior cortex, while parietal slow oscillations more effectively recruited hippocampal ripples. Hippocampal ripples reflected anatomical connectivity, as dorsal ripples preferentially enhanced parietal spindles, whereas ventral ripples engaged mainly frontal spindling. Notably, when ripples synchronized in dorsal and ventral hippocampus, local excitatory drive sharply decreased and neuronal spiking redistributed, associated cortical slow oscillations and spindle responses diminished, and cortical neuronal reactivation was suppressed, indicating that dorso-ventral ripple synchrony gates, rather than amplifies, hippocampo-cortical communication. This gating effect was most evident through interactions with brain state, as dorsal-driven reactivation persisted across vigilance states, while ventral pathways were more pronounced during sleep. Collectively, our results outline a multilayer architecture in which slow oscillations provide a global temporal scaffold, spindles implement anatomically specific reactivation channels, and ripple coordination gates hippocampo-cortical communication, likely shaping the precision and specificity of memory consolidation within a highly variable neural substrate.

">Neurotrophin-3 produced by motor neurons non-cell autonomously regulate the development of pre-motor interneurons in the developing spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The development of multicellular organisms requires proper interplays between cell-autonomous genetic programs controlled by combinations of transcription factors that regulate the differentiation of distinct cell populations and non-cell autonomous processes that coordinate the proliferation, the fate, the survival, the respective location, and the proper interactions of these populations. During the development of the nervous system, non-cell autonomous mechanisms determine neuronal fate, survival, distribution, axon guidance, and connectivity. Although similar processes are suggested to be at work in the formation of spinal motor circuits, the molecular mechanisms involved remain mostly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that the Onecut transcription factors regulate a non-cell autonomous mechanism that modulate pre-motor interneuron development. We show that conditional inactivation of the Onecut factors in spinal motor neurons affects the differentiation and the positioning of pre-motor interneuron populations. We identify that Neurotrophin-3 produced by motor neurons under the control of the Onecut factors non-cell autonomously regulate the production and the distribution of pre-motor interneuron populations. Thus, we elucidated one of the non-cell autonomous mechanisms that coordinate the formation of the spinal motor circuits.

">A left-to-right bias in spatial numerical associations with dots and symbols</a></h4>

              
                Number and space are intertwined in human and non-human cognition. A substantial body of research has shown that numerical magnitudes are mentally represented along a spatial continuum, akin to a ''mental number line''. Some suggested that its directionality is determined by culture and context. Nevertheless, evidence from preverbal infants and non-human animals indicates a consistent left-to-right directional mapping of numerosities, suggesting a biologically predisposed Spatial-Numerical Association (SNA) that may precede cultural factors. A recent study has shown that an implicit association between ''left'' and ''small''emerges not only in literate adults, but also in unschooled indigenous populations and preschool Western children. This finding suggests that SNAs may originate from universal innate mechanisms rather than being solely a by-product of cultural learning. However, while the study reported a strong association between ''left'' and ''decreasing'' numerosity, there was only a very weak association between ''right'' and ''increasing'' numerosity. This asymmetry was not predicted and needs further investigations to be understood. Here we further investigated the number/space association in implicit tasks in educated Western adults by using more variable and better controlled stimuli compared to the ones used in the previous study, and also manipulating stimulus format, using both dot patterns and symbolic numbers. Fifty-one adult participants performed a numerical comparison task within a Go-No-Go paradigm on subsequent pairs of visual stimuli (with ratios spanning from 0.75 to 0.94) that could appear on the left or on the right of a fixation point and completed two different tasks: ''press when more'' and ''press when less''. Results revealed distinct response patterns depending on the symbolic/non-symbolic nature of the stimuli. When non-symbolic stimuli were used, a consistent association between small numerosities and the left side and large numerosities and the right side was observed. When symbolic stimuli were used, only an association between large numerosities and the right side was observed. These findings support the hypothesis that SNAs may reflect a biological predisposition associated with brain asymmetry, and that task demands may interact with the underlying hemispheric specializations

                <p>Experimental behavioral neuroscience relies on the ability to deliver precise amounts of liquid volumes to animal subjects. Among others, it allows the progressive shaping of behavior through successive, automated, reinforcement, thus allowing training in more demanding behavioral tasks and the manipulation of variables that underlie the decision-making process. Here we introduce a stepper motor-based, fully integrated, open-source solution, that allows the reproducible delivery of small (&lt;1&mu;l) liquid volumes. The system can be controlled via software using the Harp protocol (e.g., from Bonsai or Python interfaces), or directly through a low-level I/O interface. Both the control software and electronics are compatible with a wide variety of motor models and mechanical designs. However, we also provide schematics, and step-by-step assembly instructions, for the mechanical design used and characterized in this manuscript. We provide benchmarks of the full integrated system using a computer vision method capable of measuring across-trial delivery of small volumes, an important metric when having behavior experiments in mind. Finally, we provide experimental validation of our system by employing it in a psychophysics rodent task, and during electrophysiological recordings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/7/ENEURO.0102-25.2025?rss=1">Novel Roles of the GPI-Anchor Cleaving Enzyme, GDE2, in Hippocampal Synaptic Morphology and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal synaptic activity is tightly regulated to ensure appropriate synaptic function and plasticity, which are important for critical cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Altered hippocampal synaptic function can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), necessitating a deeper fundamental understanding of hippocampal synaptic control mechanisms. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2 or GDPD5) is a surface transmembrane enzyme that cleaves the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor that tethers some proteins to the membrane. Mice lacking GDE2 (<I>Gde2</I>KO) display behavioral deficits in learning and memory that are hippocampal-dependent. However, roles of GDE2 in mouse hippocampal function are not known. Here, we show that GDE2 is expressed in pre- and postsynaptic compartments along apical dendrites in hippocampal CA1 cells. <I>Gde2</I>KO CA1 cells showed increased dendritic length and complexity and increased numbers of mushroom spines localized to the stratum radiatum. Furthermore, adult <I>Gde2</I>KOs displayed an increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, impaired paired-pulse facilitation, and disrupted <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated long&ndash;term depression (LTD). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PI3K-AKT-GSK3) signaling pathway, implicated in the inhibition of NMDAR-mediated LTD, was abnormally activated in the <I>Gde</I>2KO hippocampus, and inhibition of PI3K restored <I>Gde2</I>KO NMDAR-mediated LTD to WT levels. These observations identify GDE2 as an essential physiological regulator of CA1 synaptic morphology and hippocampal pre- and postsynaptic function, including the modulation of NMDAR-mediated LTD via the PI3K-AKT-GSK3 signaling axis.</p>

                <p>by Xueqing Peng, Rui Qiao, Peiluan Li, Luonan Chen</p>

Typically, in dynamic biological processes, there is a critical state or tipping point that marks the transition from one stable state to another, surpassing which a considerable qualitative shift takes place. Identifying this tipping point and its driving network is essential to avert or delay disastrous outcomes. However, most traditional approaches built upon undirected networks still suffer from a lack of robustness and effectiveness when implemented based on high-dimensional small-sample data, especially for single-cell data. To address this challenge, we develop a directed network flow entropy (DNFE) method, which can transform measured omics data into a directed network. This method is applicable to both single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk data. Applying this algorithm to six real datasets, including three single-cell datasets, two bulk tumor datasets, and a blood dataset, the method is proved to be effective not only in identifying critical states, as well as their dynamic network biomarkers, but also in helping explore regulatory relationships between genes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the DNFE algorithm is robust across various noise levels and outperforms existing methods in detecting tipping points. Furthermore, the numerical simulations for 100-node and 1000-node gene regulatory networks illustrate the method’s application for large-scale data. The DNFE method predicts active transcription factors, and further identified “dark genes”, which are usually overlooked with traditional methods.

Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have significantly enhanced biological research in various domains. However, the high cost for current ST data generation techniques restricts the large-scale application of ST. Consequently, maximization of the use of available resources to achieve robust statistical power for ST data is a pressing need. One fundamental question in ST analysis is detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different conditions using ST data. Such DEG analyses are performed frequently, but their power calculations are rarely discussed in the literature. To address this gap, we developed PoweREST, a power estimation tool designed to support the power calculation for DEG detection with 10X Genomics Visium data. PoweREST enables power estimation both before any ST experiments and after preliminary data are collected, making it suitable for a wide variety of power analyses in ST studies. We also provide a user-friendly, program-free web application that allows users to interactively calculate and visualize study power along with relevant parameters.

                <p>by Robin Vloeberghs, Anne E. Urai, Kobe Desender, Scott W. Linderman</p>

Classical decision models assume that the parameters giving rise to choice behavior are stable, yet emerging research suggests these parameters may fluctuate over time. Such fluctuations, observed in neural activity and behavioral strategies, have significant implications for understanding decision-making processes. However, empirical studies on fluctuating human decision-making strategies have been limited due to the extensive data requirements for estimating these fluctuations. Here, we introduce hMFC (Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion), a Bayesian framework designed to estimate slow fluctuations in the decision criterion from limited data. We first showcase the importance of considering fluctuations in decision criterion: incorrectly assuming a stable criterion gives rise to apparent history effects and underestimates perceptual sensitivity. We then present a hierarchical estimation procedure capable of reliably recovering the underlying state of the fluctuating decision criterion with as few as 500 trials per participant, offering a robust tool for researchers with typical human datasets. Critically, hMFC does not only accurately recover the state of the underlying decision criterion, it also effectively deals with the confounds caused by criterion fluctuations. Lastly, we provide code and a comprehensive demo to enable widespread application of hMFC in decision-making research.

The primary cilium is a conserved, microtubule-based organelle that transduces signaling pathways essential for development and homeostasis. It dynamically assembles and disassembles in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli while maintaining remarkable structural stability and tightly regulated length. The mechanisms underlying this stability and length control are not well understood. Here, we characterized CCDC66, a microtubule-associated protein linked to ciliopathies, as an important regulator of cilium maintenance and disassembly in mouse epithelial cells. Live imaging revealed that cilia in CCDC66-depleted cells frequently fluctuate in length and exhibit increased cilium disassembly and ectocytosis. Phenotypic rescue experiments and in vitro assays showed that microtubule stabilization activity of CCDC66 is required for these functions. Temporal proximity mapping identified potential new regulators and molecular pathways involved in cilium disassembly. Further characterization revealed actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking as additional mechanisms by which CCDC66 may mediate its ciliary functions. Finally, depletion of CCDC66 compromised Hedgehog and Wnt pathway activation and disrupted epithelial cell organization and polarity in two- and three‐dimensional cultures. Collectively, we showed that CCDC66 regulates both ciliary and non-ciliary processes through diverse mechanisms involving microtubules, actin, and vesicular trafficking, providing insights into the pathologies associated with CCDC66.

                <p>by Denis C. L. Lan, Laurence T. Hunt, Christopher Summerfield</p>

Much has been learned about the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which humans and other animals navigate to reach their goals. However, most studies have involved a single, well-learned environment. By contrast, real-world wayfinding often occurs in unfamiliar settings, requiring people to combine memories of landmark locations with on-the-fly information about transitions between adjacent states. Here, we studied the strategies that support human navigation in wholly novel environments. We found that during goal-directed navigation, people use a mix of strategies, adaptively deploying both associations between proximal states (state transitions) and directions between distal landmarks (vectors) at stereotyped points on a journey. Deep neural networks meta-trained with reinforcement learning to find the shortest path to goal exhibited near-identical strategies, and in doing so, developed units specialized for the implementation of vector- and state transition-based strategies. These units exhibited response patterns and representational geometries that resemble those previously found in mammalian navigational systems. Overall, our results suggest that effective navigation in novel environments relies on an adaptive mix of state transition- and vector-based strategies, supported by different modes of representing the environment in the brain.

                <p>by Vincent Paget-Blanc, Anna Cavaccini, Alessandra Longaretti, Luca Nava, Massimo Trusel, Anna Rocchi, Maria Pennuto, Elena Marcello, Fabrizio Gardoni, Barbara Greco, Raffaella Tonini</p>

The control of instrumental actions engages distinct behavioral strategies whose contributions are regulated with experience. Instrumental performance, which depends on the causal relationship between actions and their outcomes (A–O), relies on flexible, goal-directed control of behavior. Actions can become less sensitive to changes in action–outcome (A–O) contingencies with repetition, resulting in more inflexible, habitual behaviors. The loss of flexibility with repetition requires plasticity at corticostriatal circuits. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet established, and how these mechanisms specifically relate to the inability to adapt to new contingencies is unknown. In mice, we find that inflexible behavioral performance following overtraining of an appetitive instrumental task is associated with a reduced capacity of mGluR5 receptors in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) to engage intracellular signaling in response to changes in action–outcome contingency. We also observed dichotomous modulation of timing-dependent synaptic depression (tLTD) at striatal projection neurons of the indirect (iSPNs) and direct (dSPNs) pathways. Preventing overstimulation of mGluR5 signaling through a homotypic process preserved behavioral sensitivity to changes in A–O contingencies despite overtraining, and averted the related biochemical and synaptic changes. Furthermore, mGluR5 couples to different signaling pathways to regulate tLTD in iSPNs and dSPNs. Our findings demonstrate that decreased signaling capacity of mGluR1/5, accompanied by cell-type-specific modulation of corticostriatal synapses in the DLS, represents a key molecular mechanism underlying overtraining-induced behavioral inflexibility.

Metabolic cross-feeding networks are central to shaping microbial community dynamics in environments ranging from the rhizosphere, gut, and marine carbon cycling. Yet cross-feeding has predominantly been viewed by examining exchanged small metabolites. In contrast, the role of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)—a complex mixture of proteins, polysaccharides, DNA, and humic-like compounds—in cross-feeding remains poorly understood, mainly due to technical challenges in measuring their secretion relative to small metabolites. Using chitin-degrading microbes as a model system, we used a bicarbonate-buffered bioreactor coupled with elemental analysis, which allowed us to quantify both EPS and small metabolite secretion. This revealed that ~25% of carbon exuded by a chitin degrader is in the form of EPS. EPS was produced at similar levels across marine chitin-degrading isolates and seawater communities, underscoring its importance relative to small metabolites. Notably, different sources of EPS were found to select for distinct and diverse microbial communities. Combining in vitro enzyme assays and untargeted metabolomics, we show that EPS undergoes sequential degradation—from large oligomers to smaller, broadly accessible monomers. This sequential breakdown creates a temporal succession of metabolic niches, potentially fueling a shift from specialist species degrading complex substrates to a more diverse community of generalists using simpler monomers. By identifying EPS as a major and dynamic contributor to cross-feeding networks, our findings reveal a hidden layer of complexity in how microbial communities assemble and function across ecosystems.

                <p>by Asa Farahani, Zhen-Qi Liu, Eric G. Ceballos, Justine Y. Hansen, Karl Wennberg, Yashar Zeighami, Mahsa Dadar, Claudine J. Gauthier, Alain Dagher, Bratislav Misic</p>

Blood perfusion delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells, making it a fundamental feature of brain organization. How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5–22 and 36–100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows micro-architectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.
