                arXiv:2506.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many genetic and environmental factors that affect cognitive development. Music education can also be considered as one of the environmental factors. Some researchers emphasize that Music is an action that requires meta-cognitive functions such as mathematics and chess and supports spatial intelligence. The effect of Music on cognitive development in early childhood was examined using the Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets(PFS) method defined by Yager. This study created PFS based on experts' opinions, and an algorithm was given according to PFS. The algorithm's results supported the experts' data on the development of spatial-temporal skills in music education given in early childhood. The algorithm's ranking was done using the Expectation Score Function. The rankings obtained from the algorithm overlap with the experts' rankings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12055">Towards Unified Neural Decoding with Brain Functional Network Modeling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent achievements in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have demonstrated the potential to decode cognitive and motor behaviors with intracranial brain recordings; however, individual physiological and electrode implantation heterogeneities have constrained current approaches to neural decoding within single individuals, rendering interindividual neural decoding elusive. Here, we present Multi-individual Brain Region-Aggregated Network (MIBRAIN), a neural decoding framework that constructs a whole functional brain network model by integrating intracranial neurophysiological recordings across multiple individuals. MIBRAIN leverages self-supervised learning to derive generalized neural prototypes and supports group-level analysis of brain-region interactions and inter-subject neural synchrony. To validate our framework, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) signals from a cohort of individuals performing Mandarin syllable articulation. Both real-time online and offline decoding experiments demonstrated significant improvements in both audible and silent articulation decoding, enhanced decoding accuracy with increased multi-subject data integration, and effective generalization to unseen subjects. Furthermore, neural predictions for regions without direct electrode coverage were validated against authentic neural data. Overall, this framework paves the way for robust neural decoding across individuals and offers insights for practical clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12086">Wanting to Be Understood Explains the Meta-Problem of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because we are highly motivated to be understood, we created public external representations -- mime, language, art -- to externalise our inner states. We argue that such external representations are a pre-condition for access consciousness, the global availability of information for reasoning. Yet the bandwidth of access consciousness is tiny compared with the richness of `raw experience', so no external representation can reproduce that richness in full. Ordinarily an explanation of experience need only let an audience `grasp' the relevant pattern, not relive the phenomenon. But our drive to be understood, and our low level sensorimotor capacities for `grasping' so rich, that the demand for an explanation of the feel of experience cannot be ``satisfactory''. That inflated epistemic demand (the preeminence of our expectation that we could be perfectly understood by another or ourselves) rather than an irreducible metaphysical gulf -- keeps the hard problem of consciousness alive. But on the plus side, it seems we will simply never give up creating new ways to communicate and think about our experiences. In this view, to be consciously aware is to strive to have one's agency understood by oneself and others.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12117">Scale-Invariance Drives Convergence in AI and Brain Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite variations in architecture and pretraining strategies, recent studies indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12187">Characterizing Neural Manifolds' Properties and Curvatures using Normalizing Flows</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal activity is found to lie on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional neuron space. Variants of principal component analysis are frequently employed to assess these manifolds. These methods are, however, limited by assuming a Gaussian data distribution and a flat manifold. In this study, we introduce a method designed to satisfy three core objectives: (1) extract coordinated activity across neurons, described either statistically as correlations or geometrically as manifolds; (2) identify a small number of latent variables capturing these structures; and (3) offer an analytical and interpretable framework characterizing statistical properties by a characteristic function and describing manifold geometry through a collection of charts.
  To this end, we employ Normalizing Flows (NFs), which learn an underlying probability distribution of data by an invertible mapping between data and latent space. Their simplicity and ability to compute exact likelihoods distinguish them from other generative networks. We adjust the NF's training objective to distinguish between relevant (in manifold) and noise dimensions (out of manifold). Additionally, we find that different behavioral states align with the components of the latent Gaussian mixture model, enabling their treatment as distinct curved manifolds. Subsequently, we approximate the network for each mixture component with a quadratic mapping, allowing us to characterize both neural manifold curvature and non-Gaussian correlations among recording channels.
  Applying the method to recordings in macaque visual cortex, we demonstrate that state-dependent manifolds are curved and exhibit complex statistical dependencies. Our approach thus enables an expressive description of neural population activity, uncovering non-linear interactions among groups of neurons.

Abstract: A beginning is made at mapping four neural theories of consciousness onto the Common Model of Cognition. This highlights how the four jointly depend on recurrent local modules plus a cognitive cycle operating on a global working memory with complex states, and reveals how an existing integrative view of consciousness from a neural perspective aligns with the Com-mon Model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12291">Metric Framework of Coherent Activity Patterns Identification in Spiking Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial synchronization plays a crucial role in the functioning of neuronal networks: selective, coordinated activation of neurons enables information processing that flexibly adapts to a changing computational context. Since the structure of coherent activity patterns reflects the network's current state, developing automated tools to identify them is a key challenge in neurodynamics. Existing methods for analyzing neuronal dynamics tend to focus on global characteristics of the network, such as its aggregated synchrony level. While this approach can distinguish between the network's main dynamical states, it cannot reveal the localization or properties of distinct coherent patterns.
  In this work, we propose a new perspective on neural dynamics analysis that enables the study of network coherence at the single-neuron scale. We interpret the network as a metric space of neurons and represent its instantaneous state as an activity function on that space. We identify specific coherent activity clusters as regions where the activity function exhibits spatial continuity. Each cluster's activity is further characterized using the analytical properties of the activity function within that region. This approach yields a concise yet detailed algorithmic profile of the network's activity patterns.

                arXiv:2506.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled evolution equations for the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with distance-constrained non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of the pattern amplitudes. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that the distance restricted connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.

                arXiv:2506.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.

                arXiv:2506.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even during fixation the human eye is constantly in low amplitude motion, jittering over small angles in random directions at up to 100Hz. This motion results in all features of the image on the retina constantly traversing a number of cones, yet objects which are stable in the world are perceived to be stable, and any object which is moving in the world is perceived to be moving. A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed, say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior. The presentation is in two levels. First is a functional description of the action of the mechanism that is very likely responsible for the experimentally observed behavior. Second is a more speculative proposal of circuit-level neural elements that might implement the functional behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13717">Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning As Neural Manifold Packing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.

Abstract: We propose to analyze dynamically changing brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components through the Hodge decomposition. We propose to quantify the magnitude and relative strength of each component. We performed extensive simulation studies with known ground truth. The Hodge decomposition is then applied to the dynamically changing human brain networks obtained from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Our results indicate that the components of the Hodge decomposition contain biologically interpretable topological features that provide statistically significant findings not easily captured by traditional methods.

                arXiv:2410.06633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of subjective experience poses a challenge to the study of consciousness. Traditional neuroscientific approaches often concentrate on isolated facets, such as perceptual awareness or the global state of consciousness and construct a theory around the relevant empirical paradigms and findings. Theories of consciousness are, therefore, often difficult to compare; indeed, there might be little overlap in the phenomena such theories aim to explain. Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference. We review a body of work applying active inference models to the study of consciousness and argue that there is implicit in all these models a small set of theoretical commitments that point to a minimal (and testable) theory of consciousness.

                arXiv:2503.09349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.

                arXiv:2506.01303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3 dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05303">Transient dynamics of associative memory models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape near stored patterns as lingering traces of the stable basins that existed below capacity. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

                arXiv:2506.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization.
  Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 2.7-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities p_inter = 0.04-0.07. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally approached using invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.

                arXiv:2506.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The economic dispatch of generators is a major concern in thermal power plants that governs the share of each generating unit with an objective of minimizing fuel cost by fulfilling load demand. This problem is not as simple as it looks because of system constraints that cannot be neglected practically. Moreover, increased awareness of clean technology imposes another important limit on the emission of pollutants obtained from burning of fossil fuels. Classical optimization methods lack the ability of solving such a complex and multi-objective problem. Hence, various modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on evolution and social behaviour of organisms are being used to solve such problems because they are easier to implement, give accurate results and take less computational time. In this work, a study is done on most of the contemporary basic AI techniques being used in literature for power systems in general and combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) in particular. The dispatch problem is implemented on IEEE 30-bus benchmarked system in MATLAB for different load demands considering all gases (COX, NOX and SOX) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) and their results are compared with each other.

                arXiv:2506.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a handcrafted neural network that, without training, solves the seemingly difficult problem of encoding an arbitrary set of integers into a single numerical variable, and then recovering the original elements. While using only standard neural network operations -- weighted sums with biases and identity activation -- we make design choices that challenge common notions in this area around representation, continuity of domains, computation, learnability and more. For example, our construction is designed, not learned; it represents multiple values using a single one by simply concatenating digits without compression, and it relies on hardware-level truncation of rightmost digits as a bit-manipulation mechanism. This neural net is not intended for practical application. Instead, we see its resemblance to -- and deviation from -- standard trained autoencoders as an invitation to examine assumptions that may unnecessarily constrain the development of systems and models based on autoencoding and machine learning. Motivated in part by our research on a theory of biological evolution centered around natural autoencoding of species characteristics, we conclude by refining the discussion with a biological perspective.

                arXiv:2506.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) often suffer from high time complexity $O(T)$ due to the sequential processing of $T$ spikes, making training computationally expensive.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Fixed-point Parallel Training (FPT) method to accelerate SNN training without modifying the network architecture or introducing additional assumptions.
  FPT reduces the time complexity to $O(K)$, where $K$ is a small constant (usually $K=3$), by using a fixed-point iteration form of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for all $T$ timesteps.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FPT and demonstrate that existing parallel spiking neurons can be viewed as special cases of our proposed method.
  Experimental results show that FPT effectively simulates the dynamics of original LIF neurons, significantly reducing computational time without sacrificing accuracy.
  This makes FPT a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications, particularly for long-term tasks.

                arXiv:2506.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs, inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria; and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

                arXiv:2506.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active dendrites are the basis for biologically plausible neural networks possessing many desirable features of the biological brain including flexibility, dynamic adaptability, and energy efficiency. A formulation for active dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning is put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this formulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building blocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of neuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental neuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes implanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted by neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that emitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of action potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given neuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a stream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is compared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach. Overall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring only a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes. The capabilities of the neuromorphic dendrite are demonstrated for a number of scenarios including dynamic changes in the input stream, differing neuron spike rates, and varying neuron counts.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) neuron models for hardware acceleration by comparing event driven and clock-driven implementations. We begin our investigation in software, rapidly prototyping and testing various SNN models based on different variants of the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron across multiple datasets. This phase enables controlled performance assessment and informs design refinement. Our subsequent hardware phase, implemented on FPGA, validates the simulation findings and offers practical insights into design trade offs. In particular, we examine how variations in input stimuli influence key performance metrics such as latency, power consumption, energy efficiency, and resource utilization. These results yield valuable guidelines for constructing energy efficient, real time neuromorphic systems. Overall, our work bridges software simulation and hardware realization, advancing the development of next generation SNN accelerators.

                arXiv:2506.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the cost competitiveness of microreactors in today's electricity markets, with a focus on uncertainties in reactor costs. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with LCOEs ranging from \$48.21/MWh to \$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most significant impact on LCOE, while O&M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro, and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors.

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools. However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The artifact to reproduce the paper claims is available at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15209510

                arXiv:2506.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL (DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing the additional computational load.

                arXiv:2506.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning, has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) -- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis. Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis, we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

                arXiv:2506.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.

                arXiv:2506.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

We further introduce an automated abstraction mechanism that simplifies the complexity of a Polyra Swarm significantly, enhancing both their generalization and transparency. Since Polyra Swarms operate on fundamentally different principles than neural networks, they open up new research directions with distinct strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range, object detection with event cameras can enhance the performance and safety of automotive and robotics applications in real-world scenarios. However, processing sparse event data requires compute-intensive convolutional recurrent units, complicating their integration into resource-constrained edge applications. Here, we propose the Sparse Event-based Efficient Detector (SEED) for efficient event-based object detection on neuromorphic processors. We introduce sparse convolutional recurrent learning, which achieves over 92% activation sparsity in recurrent processing, vastly reducing the cost for spatiotemporal reasoning on sparse event data. We validated our method on Prophesee's 1 Mpx and Gen1 event-based object detection datasets. Notably, SEED sets a new benchmark in computational efficiency for event-based object detection which requires long-term temporal learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SEED significantly reduces synaptic operations while delivering higher or same-level mAP. Our hardware simulations showcase the critical role of SEED's hardware-aware design in achieving energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11067">Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.11067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power binary spikes, to bearing fault diagnosis, bridging the gap between high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industrial scenarios. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT, JNU, Bearing, and Gearbox benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENMap, a mapping and synthesis tool for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic computing architecture frameworks. SENECA is a flexible architectural design optimized for executing edge AI SNN/ANN inference applications efficiently. To speed up the silicon tape-out and chip design for SENECA, an accurate emulator, SENSIM, was designed. While SENSIM supports direct mapping of SNNs on neuromorphic architectures, as the SNN and ANNs grow in size, achieving optimal mapping for objectives like energy, throughput, area, and accuracy becomes challenging. This paper introduces SENMap, flexible mapping software for efficiently mapping large SNN and ANN applications onto adaptable architectures. SENMap considers architectural, pretrained SNN and ANN realistic examples, and event rate-based parameters and is open-sourced along with SENSIM to aid flexible neuromorphic chip design before fabrication. Experimental results show SENMap enables 40 percent energy improvements for a baseline SENSIM operating in timestep asynchronous mode of operation. SENMap is designed in such a way that it facilitates mapping large spiking neural networks for future modifications as well.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99650">Executioner caspase is proximal to Fasciclin 3 which facilitates non-lethal activation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system undergoes functional modification independent of cell turnover. Caspase participates in reversible neuronal modulation via non-lethal activation. However, the mechanism that enables non-lethal activation remains unclear. Here, we analyzed proximal proteins of <i>Drosophila</i> executioner caspase in the adult brain using TurboID. We discovered that executioner caspase Drice is, as an inactive proform, proximal to cell membrane proteins, including a specific splicing isoform of cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 3 (Fas3), Fas3G. To investigate whether sequestration of executioner caspase to plasma membrane of axons is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, we developed a Gal4-Manipulated Area-Specific CaspaseTracker/CasExpress system for sensitive monitoring of caspase activity near the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that <i>Fas3G</i> overexpression promotes caspase activation in olfactory receptor neurons without killing them, by inducing expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes close to Fas3G. Physiologically, <i>Fas3G</i> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation suppresses innate olfactory attraction behavior. Our findings suggest that subcellularly restricted caspase activation, defined by caspase-proximal proteins, is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, opening the methodological development of reversible modification of neuronal function via regulating caspase-proximal proteins.

                Background Traditional weaving professionals pull cloth manually during the handloom process, which can lead to several unnoticed musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate the effectiveness of cloth-pulling devices for Praewa silk weavers in Thailand. Methods An experimental trial was conducted using surface electromyography to evaluate weavers’ muscle activity, productivity and perceived satisfaction during the Praewa silk-pulling process while employing traditional cloth pulling, using a standard cloth-pulling device and using an ergonomic prototype cloth-pulling device. Results The results showed that the levels of muscle activity and hand activity with the prototype design were generally lower than those with traditional cloth pulling and with the standard cloth-pulling device (p < 0.01). There was a significant preference for the prototype, based on productivity and perceived satisfaction (p < 0.01). Conclusions The new cloth-pulling device was found to be applicable and acceptable among the weavers. Further research is needed to make appropriate revisions to the ergonomically designed tool based on ergonomic measurements of muscle activity and fatigue under field production conditions. Studies related to workstations and working conditions are needed in the weaving industry sector.

                <p>by Szilvia Barsi, Eszter Varga, Daniel Dimitrov, Julio Saez-Rodriguez, László Hunyady, Bence Szalai</p>

Intracellular signaling initiated from ligand-bound receptors plays a fundamental role in both physiological regulation and development of disease states, making receptors one of the most frequent drug targets. Systems level analysis of receptor activity can help to identify cell and disease type-specific receptor activity alterations. While several computational methods have been developed to analyze ligand-receptor interactions based on transcriptomics data, none of them focuses directly on the receptor side of these interactions. Also, most of the methods use directly the expression of ligands and receptors to infer active interaction, while co-expression of genes does not necessarily indicate functional interactions or activated state. To address these problems, we developed RIDDEN (Receptor actIvity Data Driven inferENce), a computational tool, which predicts receptor activities from the receptor-regulated gene expression profiles, and not from the expressions of ligand and receptor genes. We collected 14463 perturbation gene expression profiles for 229 different receptors. Using these data, we trained the RIDDEN model, which can effectively predict receptor activity for new bulk and single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We validated RIDDEN’s performance on independent <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> receptor perturbation data, showing that RIDDEN’s model weights correspond to known regulatory interactions between receptors and transcription factors, and that predicted receptor activities correlate with receptor and ligand expressions in <i>in vivo</i> datasets. We also show that RIDDEN can be used to identify mechanistic biomarkers in an immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patient cohort. RIDDEN, the largest transcriptomics-based receptor activity inference model, can be used to identify cell populations with altered receptor activity and, in turn, foster the study of cell-cell communication using transcriptomics data.

Background <p>HIV hotspots, regions with higher prevalence than surrounding areas, are observed across Africa, yet their formation and persistence mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that random fluctuations during the early stages of the HIV epidemic (1978–1982), amplified by positive feedback between HIV incidence and prevalence, play a critical role in hotspot formation and persistence. To explore this, we applied a network-based HIV transmission model, focusing on randomness in the spatial structure of the epidemic.</p> Methods <p>We adapted a previously validated agent-based network HIV transmission model, EMOD-HIV, to simulate HIV spread in western Kenya communities. The model includes demographics, age-structured social networks, and HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment. We simulated 250 identical communities, introducing stochastic fluctuations in network structure and case importation. Outliers were defined as communities with prevalence > 1.5x the median, and persistence as meeting these criteria for >70% of 1980–2050. We systematically varied community size (1,000–10,000), importation timing (1978–1982), and importation patterns (spread over 1, 3, or 5 years), and calculated the proportion of outliers and persistent outliers.</p> Results <p>HIV prevalence outliers were more common in smaller communities: in 1990, 25.3% (uncertainty interval: 22.3%–28.2%) of 1,000-person communities vs. 9.1% (uncertainty interval: 6.9%–11.4%) of 10,000-person communities. By 2050, 21.6% of 1,000-person communities were persistent outliers, compared to none in larger communities. Autocorrelation of HIV prevalence was high (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.801 [95% CI: 0.796–0.806] for 1,000-person communities), reflecting feedback that amplified early fluctuations.</p> Conclusions <p>Early random fluctuations contribute to the emergence and persistence of prevalence outliers, especially in smaller communities. Recognizing the role of randomness in prevalence outlier formation in these settings is crucial for refining HIV control strategies, as traditional methods may overlook these areas. Adaptive surveillance systems can enhance detection and intervention efforts for HIV and future pandemics.</p>

                <p>by Stephen Catterall, Thibaud Porphyre, Glenn Marion</p>

We introduce the inference for populations at risk (iPAR) framework which enables modelling and estimation of spatial disease dynamics in scenarios where the population at risk is unknown or poorly mapped. This framework addresses a gap in spatial infectious disease modelling approaches, with current methods typically requiring data on the spatial distribution of the population at risk. The principles for iPAR are demonstrated in the context of a susceptible-infected disease dynamics model coupled with Bayesian inference implemented via data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This implementation of iPAR is tested for a range of scenarios using simulated outbreak data. Results indicate that the method can effectively estimate key properties of disease spread from spatio-temporal case reports and make useful predictions of future spread. The method is then applied to a case study exploring the 2014–2019 Estonian outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in wild boar. Estimates of epidemiological parameters reveal evidence for long distance transmission, as well as disease control via reduction of the wild boar population in Estonia.

                <p>by Chris Scholes, Stephen Coombes, Alan R. Palmer, William S. Rhode, Rob Mill, Christian J. Sumner</p>

The dynamic fluctuations in the amplitude of sound, known as sound envelopes, are ubiquitous in natural sounds and convey information critical for the recognition of speech, and of sounds generally. We are perceptually most sensitive to slow modulations which are most common. However, previous studies of envelope coding in the brainstem found an under-representation of these slow, low-frequency, modulations. Specifically, the synchronization of spike times to the envelope was enhanced in some neuron types, forming channels specialized for envelope processing but tuned to a restricted range of fast, high-frequency, envelopes (200–500 Hz). Here, we show using a historical dataset from cats that previous analyses, which made strong assumptions about the neural code, underestimated the encoding of low-frequency envelopes. While some neurons encode envelope better than others, most encode a wide range of envelope frequencies, and represent slower envelope fluctuations most accurately in their precise patterns of spike times. Identification of envelope frequency from spike-timing was linked to reliability, and to the way that dynamics of spiking interacted with the time-varying envelope. In some of the best-performing neurons, temporally complex “mode-locked” spike patterns served to enhance envelope coding. A second long-standing contradiction was that neural envelope coding is degraded at high sound levels, whilst the perception of envelope is robust at a wide range of sound levels. We find that spike-time encoding of envelope shape becomes level-robust for small populations of neurons. These findings argue against feature-specific coding of envelopes in the brainstem, and for a distributed population spike-time code for which synchrony to the envelope is an incomplete description. This code is accurate for slow fluctuations and robust across sound level. Thus, precise spike-timing information in the brainstem is after-all aligned with the needs of communication and the perception of environmental sounds.

Mammalian oocytes are prone to chromosome segregation errors, which frequently lead into aneuploidy and pregnancy loss. A new study in PLOS Biology addresses the role of the Mad2/SGO2 complex in the control of separase activity in these cells during meiosis.

Separase plays an important role in cleaving cohesin complexes that hold chromosomes together during cell division. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology showing that control of separase activity is accomplished by cyclin B/CDK1 and securin, and does not involve SGO2 as reported in somatic cells.

                Background Postoperative infectious pneumonia (PIP) is a common and serious complication following cardiothoracic surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve interventions, and thoracic oncologic procedures. It is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and healthcare burden. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies published between January 2021 and December 2023 were identified from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Eligible studies reported the incidence and/or perioperative risk factors for PIP with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used for pooled estimates. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO 2025 CRD 420251057914. Available from https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251057914. Results Six high-quality cohort studies involving 4,392 patients were included. The pooled incidence of PIP was 14.8% (95% CI, 10.6%–19.2%). Incidence was highest after thoracic oncologic surgery (17.2%), followed by valve surgery (15.8%) and CABG (13.5%). Significant risk factors included prolonged mechanical ventilation >48 hours (OR: 3.46), age >70 years (OR: 2.71), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 2.95), cardiopulmonary bypass time >120 minutes (OR: 2.63), and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (OR: 2.38). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 46%) with no publication bias. Conclusions PIP remains a major postoperative concern. Identification of key risk factors enables targeted preventive strategies—early extubation, pulmonary optimization, and standardized care pathways—to reduce PIP incidence and improve outcomes.

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes, such as lifestyle factors, exercise explorations, holistic wellbeing and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v3?src=rss">Relationship between the perception of oral health and the quality of life of hospital staff [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

                Digital access in urban settlements is a social determinant of urban health and a formidable element of advancing sustainable growth in our cities. Yet, it is also characterised by deep inequalities and capacity gaps that prevent us from delivering on the promise of step-change digital transformations for urban health. Whilst digital urban transformations are happening worldwide, most urban health investment in this space still fail to make an impact at scale. Reviewing key evidence and foundational issues as part of a collaboration with the World Health Organization, this essay stresses three key axes for effective intervention: 1) the development of novel sources of data, 2) the improvement of digital public infrastructures, and 3) the building of digital capacity at all levels of government and civil society. It identifies three priorities for evidence-based digital transformations in urban health: networking, financing, and review. These are underpinned by a cross-cutting call to step up multilevel commitments on digital transformations for urban health.

                Employability skills of vocational high school students are needed to prepare for a reliable, professional, and globally competitive world of work. The poor work skills of vocational high school students are influenced by many factors. This study analyzes the research trends and factors that influence vocational high employability. Type of literature study using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Data collection for 2020-2024 Work skills based on a search of Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases was conducted from October 25 to 31, 2024. VOSviewer application to analyze research trends. Search using keyword employability skills and vocational high school students. The selection process was conducted by inviting three authors to review articles. If an article does not meet the criteria, the solution is to invite other reviewers or experts to help complete it. Data analysis techniques include an identification stage with records from the database and continued filtering of data that meets the criteria and does not. Filtering stage with feasibility assessment Study Stage in Article Review. The results of the study identified 1016 articles, 311 articles, 39 articles, and 96 factors influencing work skills. Six dominant factors determine work skills: creativity (FI_1), communication skills (FI_2), adaptability (FI_3), problem-solving (FI_4), critical thinking (FI_5), and self-confidence (FI_6). The determining factors of work skills internationally are more dominant in self-confidence, adaptability, and communication skills, while in Indonesia, they are communication skills and creativity. A limitation of the data search process is the use of incomplete keywords. The contribution of this study is that six determining factors were used as considerations for the qualifications of student graduates in contextual and meaningful vocational learning.

                Accumulating evidence over several years suggests that microbial infections (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi) may play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this review, we discuss the reported associations between a variety of microbes and the development of AD, as well as potential causal relationships between infections and AD risk. Having evaluated the current state of knowledge, we make specific recommendations for what it would take to present definitive evidence that chronic infections play a causal role in AD pathogenesis.

                Dysregulated progranulin expression is robustly associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent research has been progressing toward a mechanistic understanding of the role of progranulin in CNS disease pathophysiology. In this review we describe the consequences of dysregulated progranulin expression in experimental and disease states. Collectively, these studies reveal that progranulin has diverse roles as a cell signaling molecule that regulates lysosomal function, immune processes, and growth. Given the functional and pathological implications of aberrant progranulin expression, we also summarize the mechanisms of progranulin regulation. We then highlight therapeutic strategies for progranulin upregulation. Ultimately, we explore the relationship between progranulin function and regulation with the goals of identifying key open questions and facilitating rational therapeutic development.

                Beyond image perception, light profoundly regulates physiological functions such as mood and metabolism through opsins in both ocular and extraocular tissues. This review examines how non-image-forming light sensing shapes mammalian physiology and explores its implications for human health.

To help develop solutions to address this challenge, we launched the Bioimaging Brasil initiative, aimed at expanding access to advanced bioimaging techniques such as intravital microscopy. By leveraging a broad spectrum of technologies — from standard microscopes paired with cell phone cameras to cutting-edge laser scanning confocal microscopes — the initiative fosters collaboration, strengthens research capacity and serves as a global model for equitable technology dissemination.

                Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) enable the selective and sub-stoichiometric elimination of pathological proteins, yet only two E3 ligases are routinely used for this purpose. Here, we expand the repertoire of PROTAC-compatible E3 ligases by identifying a novel small molecule scaffold targeting the ubiquitin E3 ligase KLHDC2 using a fluorescence polarization-based high-throughput screen. We highlight the utility of this ligand with the synthesis of PROTACs capable of potently degrading BRD4 in cells. This work affords additional chemical matter for targeting KLHDC2 and suggests a practical approach for identifying novel E3 binders by high-throughput screening.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97036">Rate of brain aging associates with future executive function in Asian children and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Brain age has emerged as a powerful tool to understand neuroanatomical aging and its link to health outcomes like cognition. However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the rate of brain aging and its relationship to cognition. Furthermore, most brain age models are trained and tested on cross-sectional data from primarily Caucasian, adult participants. It is thus unclear how well these models generalize to non-Caucasian participants, especially children. Here, we tested a previously published deep learning model on Singaporean elderly participants (55−88 years old) and children (4−11 years old). We found that the model directly generalized to the elderly participants, but model finetuning was necessary for children. After finetuning, we found that the rate of change in brain age gap was associated with future executive function performance in both elderly participants and children. We further found that lateral ventricles and frontal areas contributed to brain age prediction in elderly participants, while white matter and posterior brain regions were more important in predicting brain age of children. Taken together, our results suggest that there is potential for generalizing brain age models to diverse populations. Moreover, the longitudinal change in brain age gap reflects developing and aging processes in the brain, relating to future cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91155">Morphology and ultrastructure of external sense organs of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Sensory perception is the ability through which an organism is able to process sensory stimuli from the environment. This stimulus is transmitted from the peripheral sensory organs to the central nervous system, where it is interpreted. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae possess peripheral sense organs on their head, thoracic, and abdominal segments. These are specialized to receive diverse environmental information, such as olfactory, gustatory, temperature, or mechanosensory signals. In this work, we complete the description of the morphology of external larval sensilla and provide a comprehensive map of the ultrastructure of the different types of sensilla that comprise them. This was achieved by 3D electron microscopic analysis of partial and whole body volumes, which contain high-resolution and complete three-dimensional data of the anatomy of the sensilla and adjacent ganglia. Our analysis revealed three main types of sensilla on thoracic and abdominal segments: the papilla sensillum, the hair sensillum, and the knob sensillum. They occur solitary or organized in compound sensilla such as the thoracic keilin’s organ or the terminal sensory cones. We present a spatial map defining these sensilla by their position on thoracic and abdominal segments. Furthermore, we identify and name the sensilla at the larval head and the last fused abdominal segments. We show that mechanosensation dominates in the larval peripheral nervous system, as most sensilla have corresponding structural properties. The result of this work, the construction of a complete structural and neuronal map of the external larval sensilla, provides the basis for following molecular and functional studies to understand which sensory strategies the <i>Drosophila</i> larva employs to orient itself in its natural environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91387">Four individually identified paired dopamine neurons signal taste punishment in larval Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) play key roles in processing rewards and punishments across species. They evaluate sensory input, store memories, and update them based on relevance. To understand how individual DANs contribute to these functions, we studied <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, which have only about 120 DANs. Only eight of these project to the mushroom body (MB), a center for olfactory learning. These eight are divided into the pPAM and DL1 clusters, with four DANs each. We confirmed that pPAM neurons in the MB medial lobe encode sugar rewards. In the DL1 cluster, four neurons—DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1—each target different MB regions. Notably, optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 can substitute for punishment. Additional methods (inhibition, calcium imaging, connectomics) show each DL1 DAN encodes a unique aspect of punishment, with DAN-g1 being pivotal for salt-based signals. Our findings reveal a clear division of labor among larval DL1 DANs for encoding punishment. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102676">CARD8 inflammasome activation during HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission</a></h4>

              
                Our previous work demonstrated that CARD8 detects HIV-1 infection by sensing the enzymatic activity of the HIV protease, resulting in CARD8-dependent inflammasome activation (Kulsuptrakul et al., 2023). CARD8 harbors a motif in its N-terminus that functions as a HIV protease substrate mimic, permitting innate immune recognition of HIV-1 protease activity, which when cleaved by HIV protease triggers CARD8 inflammasome activation. Here, we sought to understand CARD8 responses in the context of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission via a viral synapse. We observed that cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 between infected T cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages induces CARD8 inflammasome activation in a manner that is dependent on viral protease activity and largely independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, to further evaluate the viral determinants of CARD8 sensing, we tested a panel of HIV protease inhibitor-resistant clones to establish how variation in HIV protease affects CARD8 activation. We identified mutant HIV-1 proteases that differentially cleave and activate CARD8 compared to wildtype HIV-1, thus indicating that natural variation in HIV protease affects not only the cleavage of the viral Gag-Pol polyprotein but also likely impacts innate sensing and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91602">Stumpy forms are the predominant transmissible forms of Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                Schuster et al<i>.</i> demonstrated that bloodstream slender forms of African trypanosomes are readily transmissible to young tsetse flies where they can complete their complex life cycle (Schuster et al., 2021). In their experimental conditions, a single slender parasite was sufficient for productive infection. Here, we compared the infectivity of slender and stumpy bloodstream forms in adult flies with a mature immune system, and without using any chemical compounds that would alter the insect immune response and/or promote the infection. After ingestion of slender forms, infected flies were observed only in 1 out of 24 batches of non-immunocompetent teneral flies and with a high number of parasites. In contrast, infected flies were detected in 75% (18/24) of the batches infected with stumpy parasites, and as few as 10 stumpy parasites produced mature infections in immune adult flies. We discuss that, although Schuster et al. have demonstrated the intrinsic capacity of slender form trypanosomes to infect young and naive tsetse flies, highlighting the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of these protists, this phenomenon is unlikely to significantly contribute to the epidemiology of African trypanosomiases. According to both experimental and field observations, stumpy forms appear to be the most adapted forms for African trypanosome transmission from the mammalian host to the tsetse fly vector in natural conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92712">Predictive learning rules generate a cortical-like replay of probabilistic sensory experiences</a></h4>

              
                The brain is thought to construct an optimal internal model representing the probabilistic structure of the environment accurately. Evidence suggests that spontaneous brain activity gives such a model by cycling through activity patterns evoked by previous sensory experiences with the experienced probabilities. The brain’s spontaneous activity emerges from internally driven neural population dynamics. However, how cortical neural networks encode internal models into spontaneous activity is poorly understood. Recent computational and experimental studies suggest that a cortical neuron can implement complex computations, including predictive responses, through soma–dendrite interactions. Here, we show that a recurrent network of spiking neurons subject to the same predictive learning principle provides a novel mechanism to learn the spontaneous replay of probabilistic sensory experiences. In this network, the learning rules minimize probability mismatches between stimulus-evoked and internally driven activities in all excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This learning paradigm generates stimulus-specific cell assemblies that internally remember their activation probabilities using within-assembly recurrent connections. Our model contrasts previous models that encode the statistical structure of sensory experiences into Markovian transition patterns among cell assemblies. We demonstrate that the spontaneous activity of our model well replicates the behavioral biases of monkeys performing perceptual decision making. Our results suggest that interactions between intracellular processes and recurrent network dynamics are more crucial for learning cognitive behaviors than previously thought.

                Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus respond to multiple metabolic signals and distribute neuroendocrine information to other brain regions such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), which plays a central role in metabolic homeostasis. Neural projections from AgRP neurons to the PVH form during the postnatal lactational period in mice and these projections are reduced in offspring of dams that consumed a high-fat diet (HFD) during lactation (MHFD-L). Here, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize microglial morphology in MHFD-L offspring and identified changes that were regionally localized to the PVH and appeared temporally restricted to the period when AgRP neurons innervate this region. In addition, axon labeling experiments revealed that microglia engulf AgRP terminals in the PVH, and that the density of AgRP innervation to the PVH in MHFD-L offspring may be dependent on microglia, because microglial depletion blocked the decrease in PVH AgRP innervation observed in MHFD-L offspring, as well as prevented the increased body weight exhibited at weaning. Together, these findings suggest that microglia are activated by exposure to MHFD-L and interact directly with AgRP axons during postnatal development to permanently alter innervation of the PVH, with implications for developmental programming of metabolic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94391">Spectral decomposition unlocks ascidian morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Describing morphogenesis generally consists in aggregating the multiple high-resolution spatiotemporal processes involved into reproducible low-dimensional morphological processes consistent across individuals of the same species or group. In order to achieve this goal, biologists often have to submit movies issued from live imaging of developing embryos either to a qualitative analysis or to basic statistical analysis. These approaches, however, present noticeable drawbacks as they can be time consuming, hence unfit for scale, and often lack standardization and a firm foundation. In this work, we leverage the power of a continuum mechanics approach and flexibility of spectral decompositions to propose a standardized framework for automatic detection and timing of morphological processes. First, we quantify whole-embryo scale shape changes in developing ascidian embryos by statistically estimating the strain rate tensor field of its time-evolving surface without the requirement of cellular segmentation and tracking. We then apply to this data spectral decomposition in space using spherical harmonics and in time using wavelets transforms. These transformations result in the identification of the principal dynamical modes of ascidian embryogenesis and the automatic unveiling of its blueprint in the form of scalograms that tell the story of development in ascidian embryos.

                Motivational deficits are common in several brain disorders, and motivational syndromes like apathy and anhedonia predict worse outcomes. Disrupted effort-based decision-making may represent a neurobiological underpinning of motivational deficits, shared across neuropsychiatric disorders. We measured effort-based decision-making in 994 participants using a gamified online task, combined with computational modelling, and validated offline for test–retest reliability. In two pre-registered studies, we first replicated studies linking impaired effort-based decision-making to neuropsychiatric syndromes, taking both a transdiagnostic and a diagnostic-criteria approach. Next, testing participants with <i>early</i> and <i>late</i> circadian rhythms in the morning and evening, we find circadian rhythm interacts with time-of-testing to produce parallel effects on effort-based decision-making. Circadian rhythm may be an important variable in computational psychiatry, decreasing reliability or distorting results when left unaccounted for. Disentangling effects of neuropsychiatric syndromes and circadian rhythm on effort-based decision-making will be essential to understand motivational pathologies and to develop tailored clinical interventions.

">Compensatory Mechanisms in Visual Sequence Learning: An fMRI Study of Children with Developmental Language Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Symptoms of developmental language disorder (DLD) may in part result from an underlying deficit in statistical learning (SL). This learning deficit may be related to the ability to extract probabilistic properties of events in the environment, which is based on the functions of cortical and subcortical brain regions underlying SL. Using a behavioral SL task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested SL ability in the visual domain and its neural correlates in children with DLD and their typically developing (TD) peers. During fMRI, children performed SL tasks involving sequences of two types of stimuli: easy-to-name (EN) objects and difficult-to-name (DN) objects. The children underwent a pre-training fMRI, one week of behavioural training and a post-training fMRI. Similar task performance was observed in both groups during the experimental sessions, with an improvement in performance following training in the SL tasks involving both EN and DN objects. FMRI results revealed that, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the frontal cortex and temporal pole for EN objects. Furthermore, in the TD group, the left putamen, globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus were involved in the early stages of SL, whereas in the DLD group, these areas were involved in SL after training. For DN objects, after training, the DLD group presented greater involvement of the parietal and precuneus regions in the SL task performance. Our results suggest that children with DLD may employ different cognitive processes in SL than TD children, possibly as a compensatory mechanism.

">The cortical scene processing network emerges in infancy, prior to independent navigation experience</a></h4>

              
                Sighted people rely on vision to recognize and navigate the local environment. By adulthood, human cortex contains at least three regions that respond selectively to visual scene information, but it remains unknown when or how these regions develop. One hypothesis is that scene selectivity emerges gradually in regions that initially prefer certain low-level visual features (e.g., peripheral visual input, high spatial frequencies, rectilinearity), and then exposure to the visual statistics of natural scenes drives the emergence of scene selective responses. However, both aspects of this hypothesis remain to be tested: how early scene selectivity first arises in human development, and whether it is driven by passive exposure to visual statistics. We therefore collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data from awake 2-9-month-old infants while they watched videos of real-world scenes with ego-motion, as well as faces, objects, and scrambled videos. We found stronger responses to scenes than control conditions in the location of all three scene regions. Scene-selective responses could not be explained by low-level visual properties of the stimuli, and were found in infants as young as 2-5 months old, with no evidence of age-related change. We also measured infants experience independently navigating (e.g., crawling), which was not necessary for the development of scene-selectivity. In sum, cortical regions are scene-selective in human infants prior to independent navigation, and after only limited exposure to visual scene statistics.

">Reversed functional gradient in primate prefrontal cortex: posterior dominance and frontopolar deactivation</a></h4>

              
                The frontopolar cortex (FPC) is thought to coordinate the more posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during complex, non-routine behaviors through high-level functions such as management of multiple goals, exploration, and self-generated decision-making. However, direct neurophysiological comparisons with other prefrontal regions are lacking, leaving the FPC's putative dominance untested. Contrary to this view, our comparison of neuronal activity across the full anteroposterior LPFC in macaques during six distinct tasks probing these functions revealed a posterior-to-mid LPFC dominance, with resource-allocation, novelty-detection (including reward-prediction error), and modality invariant decision-monitoring signals all showing a common posterior bias. In contrast, regardless of task demands, the FPC's strongest encoding was about the most recently executed action, and it displayed minimal object selectivity, even when objects were task-critical. We identified a turning point in this graded posterior-to-anterior transition from task-positive to task-negative regions around the border between the anterior and middle thirds of the LPFC. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that the LPFC is anterior-dominant across primate species, and provide evolutionary constraints on theories of human prefrontal organization.

">Motoneurons can count: A cell intrinsic spike number memory compensates for deviations from rate coding</a></h4>

              
                Firing rate is an important means of encoding information in many types of neurons. A prime example is asynchronous flight as used by ~600,000 insect species (Dudley, 2018), where wingbeat frequency and flight power output are controlled by a rate code of the flight power motoneurons (Hurkey et al., 2023). The five motoneurons that innervate the wing depressor muscle fibers translate different magnitudes of excitatory drive smoothly into changes of their common firing rates, which in turn, are linearly related to wing power output (Gordon and Dickinson, 2006). Such motoneuron input/output properties are called type-I excitability and are achieved by the expression of specific combinations of ion currents that linearize the frequency-input current curve. But are there additional motoneuron properties that compensate for acute perturbation of their rate code? Here we combine in vivo electrophysiology with Drosophila genetics to test for mechanisms that compensate for transient perturbation of rate coding during behavior. We show that MN intrinsic properties compensate for the occurrence of extra spikes by delaying the subsequent spikes, thus restoring rate coding fidelity. The underlying mechanism is dose and phase dependent. First, compensatory increases of subsequent interspike interval durations grow with the number of supernumerous spikes that interfere with coding. Second, the magnitude of the compensation for single extra spikes depends on when during an interspike interval these occur. This mechanism depends at least in part on axonally localized HCN channels and increases the fidelity of motoneuron rate coding in the light of perturbation during flight motor behavior.

">Selective octopaminergic tuning of mushroom body circuits during memory formation</a></h4>

              
                The catecholamines octopamine and tyramine undoubtedly have a major impact on the life of an insect. A wide range of physiological processes and behaviours are regulated by these neurotransmitters/hormones. Octopamine and tyramine act homologous to the adrenergic system of vertebrates, primarily adapting the organism to the given situation, by switching between the states of alertness and rest. Interestingly, higher brain functions like learning and memory are also regulated by octopamine and tyramine. About 30 years ago, initial work in Drosophila has demonstrated that dopaminergic neurons signal punishment, while octopaminergic neurons signal reward during olfactory associative learning and memory. In the meantime, however, it has become clear that distinct types of dopaminergic neurons convey both reward and punishment signals to the mushroom bodies, a central brain region responsible for the formation and storage of associative memories. Although some conflicting data remain, these findings challenge the previously established model of functional segregation and may limit the proposed role of octopamine neurons as teaching neurons during memory formation. We have therefore re-examined the role of octopamine in learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. Through a combination of Ca2+ imaging, anatomical studies and gain-of-function and loss-of-function behavioural approaches, we demonstrate that octopamine signalling plays a crucial role in larval learning by modulating dopaminergic neurons across distinct cell clusters to orchestrate memory processes.

">Population sparseness determines strength of Hebbian plasticity for maximal memory lifetime in associative networks</a></h4>

              
                The brain can efficiently learn and form memories based on limited exposure to stimuli. One key factor believed to support this ability is sparse coding, which can reduce overlap between representations and minimize interference. It is well known that increased sparseness can enhance memory capacity, yet its impact on the speed of learning remains poorly understood. Here we analyze the relationship between population sparseness and learning speed -- specifically, how the learning speed that maximizes memory capacity depends on the sparseness of the neural code, and how this in turn affects the networks maximal capacity. To this end, we study a feedforward network with Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity and a two-state synapse model. The network learns to associate binary input-output pattern pairs, where sparseness corresponds to a small fraction of active neurons per pattern. The learning speed is modeled as the probability of synaptic changes during learning. The results presented in this manuscript are based on both network simulations and an analytical theory that predicts expected memory capacity and optimal learning speed. For both perfect and noisy retrieval cues, we find that the optimal learning speed indeed increases with increasing pattern sparseness -- an effect that is more pronounced for input sparseness than for output sparseness. Interestingly, the optimal learning speed stays the same across different network sizes if the number of active units in an input pattern is kept constant. While the capacity obtained at optimal learning speed increases monotonically with output sparseness, its dependence on input sparseness is non-monotonic. Overall, we provide the first detailed investigation of the interactions between population sparseness, learning speed, and storage capacity. Our findings propose that differences in population sparseness across brain regions may underlie observed differences in how quickly those regions adapt and learn.

">Elucidating the Contribution of OVLT Glutamatergic Neurons to Mineralocorticoid Hypertension in TASK-/- Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Aldosterone overactivity intensifies central sodium sensitivity and sympathetic output, driving salt-sensitive hypertension, but specific mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Herein, we aimed to explore the role of organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis glutamatergic neurons (OVLTGlut) and their hyperexcitability mechanisms in hyperaldosteronism-associated hypertension. Methods: Adult age matched male TASK-/- mice (primary aldosteronism model) and wild-type controls (TASK+/+) mice were used. Neuronal excitability was assessed via patch-clamp techniques. Arterial blood pressure (BP) monitored via telemetry or carotid catheterization. Chronic drug delivery used minipumps. RNA-seq/qPCR profiled gene expression, and intracerebroventricular hypertonic saline tested sodium sensitivity. Results: In TASK-/- mice, heightened OVLTGlut activity increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension, mitigated by OVLTGlut neuron ablation. Optogenetic activation of these neurons or their paraventricular nucleus (PVN) / rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) projections acutely elevated BP, with ablation reducing BP selectively in TASK-/- mice. Aldosterone dependence of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron hyperactivity was evident in both TASK-/- mice and TASK+/+ mice with chronic aldosterone infusion. Aldosterone chronic infusion enhanced central sodium pressor effects, that were nullified by OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM neuron lesioning. RNA-seq indicated that aldosterone-induced ion channel expression spectrum changes, including potassium channels and the epithelial sodium channel, underlie the neuronal hyperexcitability. Conclusion: Overactivation of OVLTGlut neurons contributes to hypertension in TASK-/- mice through regulation of OVLTGlut-PVN/RVLM circuits. The hyperexcitability of these neurons, possibly due to aldosterone-induced changes in ion channel expression spectrum, contribute to hypertension by amplifying central sodium sensitivity.

">Proteomic and metabolic profiling reveals APOE4-dependent shifts in whole brain, neuronal, and astrocytic mitochondrial function and glycolysis</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variation is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Studies on APOE genotype dependent changes have largely focused on amyloid beta aggregation, disease pathology, and lipid metabolism. Recently, there has been increased interest in the relationship between metabolic function and APOE genetic variation. In this study, we examined how APOE genotype can alter metabolism in the brains of young male and female APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice. In combination with this, we also examined cell type-specific differences using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived astrocytes and neurons. We found sex and genotype dependent changes to metabolism in the brains of young APOE TR mice. Specifically, APOE4 mice show signs of metabolic stress and compensatory mechanisms in the brain. Using proteomics and stable isotope tracing metabolomics, we found that APOE4 iAstrocytes and iNeurons exhibit signs of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered TCA cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle activity, and a metabolic shift toward glycolysis. Taken together, this data indicates APOE4 causes early changes to metabolism within the central nervous system. While this study establishes a relationship between APOE genotype and alterations in bioenergetics, additional studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms.

">High-throughput single-cell CRISPRi screens stratify neurodevelopmental functions of schizophrenia-associated genes</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with strong genetic underpinnings, yet the molecular mechanisms linking genetic risk to disrupted brain development remain poorly understood. Transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin regulators (CRs) are increasingly implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, where their dysregulation may disrupt neurodevelopmental programs. Despite this, systematic functional interrogation in human models has been limited. Here, we combine pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens with high-throughput single-cell multiomic profiling in hiPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons to functionally assess 65 schizophrenia-associated genes. Based on public datasets and literature review, we selected 55 TFs and CRs, along with ten additional risk genes whose loss-of-function has been linked to schizophrenia. Our single-cell CRISPRi readouts revealed that perturbations in TFs and CRs converge on disrupting neurodevelopmental timing. CRISPRi of several factors delayed neural differentiation, whereas others, such as the knockdown of MCRS1, drove precocious neural commitment. Validation screens combined with cell cycle and metabolic indicators confirmed the differentiation-restricting or -promoting roles of these TFs and CRs. Multimodal trajectory analysis uncovered discrete transcriptional and epigenomic states representing delayed and accelerated neurodevelopment, enriched for schizophrenia GWAS loci and disease-relevant pathways. Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified TCF4 and ZEB1 as critical mediators opposing the neural differentiation trajectory. Functional overexpression of these TFs followed by chromatin profiling demonstrated that TCF4 restrains, while ZEB1 promotes, neural differentiation in a stage-specific and competitive manner. Furthermore, we show that MCRS1 represses ZEB1 expression, positioning MCRS1 as a key brake on premature neurodevelopment. Together, our study establishes a scalable framework that integrates genetic perturbation, single-cell multiomics, and GRN modeling to functionally annotate disease-linked genes. We reveal convergent regulatory axes that underlie altered neurodevelopmental timing in schizophrenia, offering mechanistic insights into how chromatin misregulation contributes to disease pathogenesis.

">Differential effect of low and high frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical excitability and myelination after neonatal hypoxia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Premature infants are highly susceptible to intermittent hypoxic brain injury, which is associated with adverse motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes, including deficits in attention, hyperactivity, and learning. Previous animal studies have shown myelination deficits and increased glutamatergic synaptic strength in the sensory-motor cortex. The study investigates the feasibility, safety, and therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in ameliorating central hypomyelination, reducing excessive glutamatergic transmission in cortical neurons following neonatal intermittent hypoxia (IH), and improving behavioral outcomes. In the mouse model of neonatal intermittent hypoxia, low-frequency (LF-rTMS) stimulation at 1 Hz or high-frequency (HF-rTMS) at 10 Hz stimulation was applied for 5 days shortly after the IH injury. The rTMS regimen did not induce apoptosis or inflammation. HF-rTMS significantly ameliorated hypomyelination in the corticospinal tract, with a larger increase in MPF in the stimulated hemisphere and also in the contralateral hemisphere. LF-rTMS reduced locomotor hyperactivity in female IH mice and decreased elevated glutamatergic synaptic excitability in motor cortex slices. This study provides evidence that rTMS can modulate both myelination and synaptic excitability, leading to improved behavioral outcomes after neonatal hypoxic brain injury. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of rTMS as an early intervention strategy for neurological sequelae of perinatal hypoxia.

">Lycium barbarum polysaccharide alleviates neurobehavioral deficits in mice with ischemic cerebral injury</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To investigate the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on neurobehavioral impairments in mice with ischemic stroke and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods: A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established using the filament occlusion method to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LBP on pathological brain tissue damage after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). Mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham surgery (Sham), I/R, and I/R + LBP. Behavioral tests, including the Y-maze test, rotarod test, and balance beam test, were systematically conducted to assess the impact of LBP on neurobehavioral impairments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify peripheral blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), reflecting inflammatory status. Results: LBP significantly ameliorated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in mice with cerebral I/R injury, demonstrating marked protection against I/R-induced neurofunctional damage. LBP notably improved motor and memory deficits caused by ischemic stroke. Compared to the I/R group, LBP improved neuroinflammation and oxidative stress levels post-I/R injury. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that LBP alleviates ischemic stroke-induced neurological damage by attenuating inflammatory responses.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory hypersensitivity is a well-established phenotype of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), but how it relates to neurobehavioral biomarkers remains poorly understood. To offer an integrated model, we propose a dual thalamic framework with hypo-lemniscal (LEM) and hyper-extralemniscal (EXLEM) thalamic models. Traditional FXS studies may have been conflating LEM and EXLEM systems, misrepresenting the origins of the hypersensitivity. We hypothesize that hyper-EXLEM pathology impacts FXS symptoms more. To test this hypothesis, we first review the dual thalamic systems and then demonstrate the hypo-LEM and hyper-EXLEM models in individuals with FXS. We use a 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ie LEM responses) paradigm with relatively long (1.5 to 3 s) stimulus and interstimulus intervals to evoke N1/P2 as Vertex Potentials (VPs, ie EXLEM responses) for onset and offset of the stimulus. We analyzed electroencephaogram (EEG) responses from 29 FXS and 33 healthy comparison individuals. Results showed lower intertrial coherence (ITC) in FXS, consistent with hypo-LEM predictions, and larger vertex potentials consistent with hyper-EXLEM predictions. Correlation analyses revealed that enhanced VPs classified FXS males more sensitively than ITC. These findings indicate that hyperreactivity of the EXLEM system is more dominantly related to FXS, which can provide a more accurate account for guiding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</span>

">Multi-Scale Parcellation of Dynamic Causal Models of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                The hierarchical organization of the brain's distributed network has received growing interest from the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to enhance our understanding of the human cognition and behavior, in health and disease. While most multiscale connectivity analyses focus on structural and functional networks, characterizing the effective connectome across multiple scales has been somewhat overlooked - mostly for computational reasons. The difficulty of estimating large cyclic causal models on the one hand, and the scarcity of theoretical frameworks for systematically moving between scales on the other hand, have hindered progress in this direction. This technical note introduces a top-down multi-scale parcellation scheme for dynamic causal models, with application to neuroimaging data. The method is based on Bayesian model comparison, as a generalization to the well-known delta-BIC method. To facilitate the computations, recent developments in linear dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and Bayesian model reduction (BMR) are deployed. Specifically, a naive version of BMR is introduced, using which the parcellation scheme can be scaled up to hundreds or thousands of regions. Notably, the derivations reveal an analytical relationship between the model comparison score and the concept of cut size in graph theory. This duality puts the tools of graph theory at the service of model evidence optimization and significance testing. The proposed method was applied to simulated and empirical causal models, for face and construct validity. Notably, the large causal network (inferred from a neuroimaging dataset) showed scale-invariance in multiple measures. Future generalizations of this technique and its potential applications in systems and clinical neuroscience have been discussed.

">Automated 3D Segmentation of Human Vagus Nerve Fascicles and Epineurium from Micro-Computed Tomography Images Using Anatomy-Aware Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT sub-volumes (11.4 [&mu]m isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net's performance against a 2D U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to the 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle-level accuracy. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.

">Innervation of Retrodiscal Tissues in Patients with Temporomandibular Joint Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMJDs) are a group of musculoskeletal conditions affecting the orofacial region and often associated with facial pain. Understanding the sensory innervation of TMJ structures, particularly the retrodiscal tissue, is essential for identifying pain mechanisms in TMJD because to study these mechanisms, we must first determine the sensory neuronal makeup of the TMJ. However, data on nerve types within TMJ tissues remain limited. This study examined the sensory and sympathetic nerve profiles in retrodiscal tissues from TMJD patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or condylar hyperplasia (CH) who underwent bilateral TMJ replacement (TMJR). Immunohistochemistry with specific nerve markers was used to visualize and quantify nerve subtypes. CH tissues had significantly lower densities of pgp9.5+ sensory fibers compared to RA and OA, which showed similar levels. Across all subtypes, the ratio of unmyelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH-) to myelinated (pgp9.5+/NFH+) fibers was approximately 70:30. Most sensory nerves were CGRP+ (peptidergic), while a smaller portion were CGRP- (non-peptidergic), some of which were parvalbumin-positive (PV+). Both myelinated and non-myelinated peptidergic as well as non-peptidergic fibers were present in the retrodiscal tissues. In addition to sensory innervation, all retrodiscal tissues contained tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) sympathetic fibers, primarily innervating blood vessels (alpha-smooth muscle actin+). These vessels were also predominantly innervated by unmyelinated sensory fibers, with limited input from myelinated sensory nerves. In summary, all TMJD subtypes shared similar nerve compositions, but CH tissues exhibited reduced sensory nerve density, a potential explanation for the lower association with pain compared to OA and RA. For all TMJD subtypes, retrodiscal tissue vasculature was mainly innervated by sympathetic and unmyelinated sensory nerves. These findings enhance understanding of the neural basis of TMJD related pain.

">Preventing Microglial Reactivity Protects from Acute and Progressive Neuronal Dysfunction, Motor Impairments and Sedation following Alcohol Abuse</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol abuse is the primary risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, characterized by systemic inflammation, multi-organ damage, and neurological impairments. While direct effects of alcohol on brain function are well-established, the role of microglia in acute and chronic neurological dysfunction in AUD remains unclear. Using longitudinal in vivo imaging in mice during acute and repeated alcohol abuse, we found that microglia exhibit dynamic morphological responses that precede but parallel ethanol-induced sedation. Ethanol also induced microglia-dependent synapse elimination and reduced neuronal activity and density. Genetic disruption of microglial MyD88 reversed these ethanol-associated changes in microglial reactivity, neuronal structure and function, while protecting against alcohol-induced intoxication and motor impairments. These findings identify microglia as cellular drivers of acute and chronic brain dysfunction following alcohol abuse, and highlight MyD88 as a critical therapeutic target for the detrimental neurological consequences of AUD.

">Effects of aging on upper body express visuomotor responses while reaching under varying postural demands</a></h4>

              
                Humans can react remarkably quickly to novel or displaced visual stimuli when time is of the essence. Such movements are thought to be initiated by a subcortical fast visuomotor network, but it is unclear how this network declines with age. Past work in the upper limb has detailed delayed reaching corrections to jumped visual stimuli in the elderly, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these changes of the fast visuomotor network are poorly understood. Conversely, work in the lower limb has reported delayed muscle recruitment during obstacle avoidance, but such findings may be confounded by age-related challenges in postural control. The output of the fast visuomotor network can be quantified by measuring express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are the earliest and very short-latency bursts of muscle activity that follow visual target presentation. Here, we compare the prevalence, latency, and magnitude of EVRs in elderly (58-80 years old) and younger (18-25 years old) participants performing visually-guided reaches. We also investigated the impact of postural stability by having participants reach either while seated on a stable chair, or on a wobble stool. Both the elderly and younger cohorts expressed EVRs, but EVRs in the elderly were comparatively less frequent, and had longer latencies and smaller magnitude. Postural instability had no effects on these outcomes. Our results suggest age-related declines in the fast visuomotor network, potentially resulting from deterioration of underlying circuits and a prioritization of stability over speed. This study serves as an important standard for future research investigating clinical populations.

">Proximity labelling reveals the compartmental proteome of murine sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular architecture of peripheral sensory neurons is critical as we pursue novel drug targets against pain and neuropathy. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) show extensive compartmentalization, thus understanding each compartment - from the peripheral to central terminals - is key to this effort. To systematically profile this spatial complexity, we generated a TurboIDfl/fl transgenic mouse line (ROSA26em1(TurboID)Bros), enabling targeted proximity labelling and deep proteomic profiling of DRG neuron compartments via AdvillinCre. Our data reveal distinct proteomic signatures across neuronal compartments that reflect specialized neuronal functions. We provide proteomic insights into previously inaccessible nerve terminals both in the periphery (innervating the skin) and in the spinal cord. Further, using a DRG explant model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we uncovered novel and discrete proteome changes, highlighting neuronal vulnerability. Together, our findings provide a unique proteome atlas of the sensory neuron proteome across anatomical domains and demonstrate the utility of proximity labelling proteomics for detecting compartment-specific molecular alterations in a disease model. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for mechanistic studies of sensory neuron function and pathology.

">Unlocking the Neuropeptidome using a Novel Endogenous Peptidomics Framework</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous peptides have garnered increasing attention over the past decade driven by the development of advanced analytical methods. However, large-scale investigations of peptides as potential disease biomarkers or drug candidates are still hindered by their challenging biochemical properties and the scarcity of specialized analytical tools. Among these, neuropeptides are particularly challenging to study due to their low in vivo concentration, rapid turnover rate, and high structural variability. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great ability in profiling low-abundance ions. Nevertheless, most available DIA analytical tools are designed for proteomics studies and are not suitable for endogenous peptides, as there is no set enzymatic cleavage for these peptides. Here, we introduce the novel EndoGenius platform, paired with DIA-NN, to achieve high-confidence neuropeptide identification using an updated spectral library for DIA MS analysis. By employing orthogonal offline fractionation, ion mobility instrumentation, and an optimized database searching algorithm specifically for neuropeptides, we have constructed the largest crustacean neuropeptide spectral library to date. With this library, in combination with neural networking technology, we report a 100-fold increase in the number of neuropeptides identified in all Cancer borealis tissues analyzed. We also cross-validated these findings with transcriptomics data to enhance identification confidence. This workflow presents a novel analytical framework for DIA peptidomics analysis, offering a robust approach to studying neuropeptides and other endogenous peptides.

">LSD Restores Synaptic Plasticity in VTA of Morphine-Treated Mice and Disrupts Morphine-Conditioned Place Preference</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics are emerging as a promising treatment option for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. One potential mechanism underlying their therapeutic benefits may involve a reversal of maladaptive plasticity induced by drug exposure. Here, we identify physiological, behavioral, and epigenetic impacts of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on morphine-treated male and female mice. Morphine was selected due to the high leverage capacity to address the opioid epidemic. A single treatment of LSD, or 4 microdoses of LSD, cause accelerated extinction of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Whole-cell electrophysiology revealed that excitatory synaptic plasticity, which was eliminated in VTA GABA neurons following morphine exposure, was restored 24 hours after a single high dose of LSD. To explore the impact of LSD treatment on potential epigenetic changes, whole-brain DNA methylation analysis in morphine-treated mice that received either saline or LSD post-morphine treatment revealed significant differences in methylation profiles associated with LSD treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that LSD may reverse or prevent morphine-induced changes in reward circuit plasticity and attenuate measures of morphine-preference.

">Effects of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation on pupil dilation are dependent on sensory matching</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a promising non-invasive method to modulate motivation, cognition, and affect. According to a recent meta-analysis, pulsed taVNS induces larger pupil dilation (vs. sham), but sensory aspects of the stimulation may contribute to these differences. Moreover, included studies were often small and stimulation was only applied to the left ear, so that questions about the robustness and generalization remain. Here, we investigated the effects of pulsed taVNS (1s, 20Hz, 400s pulse width) at the right ear on phasic pupil dilation using a randomized crossover design in 94 participants (47 women). We initially calibrated the stimulation amplitude to match the perceived sensation across conditions and tracked sensation over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, taVNS did not elicit greater pupil dilation versus sham (b = -0.42, 95% CI [-1.30; 0.46], p = .35). However, taVNS effects were larger if sham was perceived as less intense despite the initial matching (b = 3.39, 95% CI [0.62; 6.17], p = .017). Differences in intensity ratings were mainly associated with sham-induced pupil dilation (r = -.25, 95% CI [-.43; -.05], p = .013). To summarize, our results recapitulate the findings of other studies using fixed amplitudes by showing that right-sided pulsed taVNS only induced larger pupil dilation against sham if differences in sensation arose. These findings highlight the challenge of establishing a suitable sham condition since both taVNS and sham affect sensory nerves, potentially leading to confounding effects.

">Glutaminolysis Fuels Reactive Astrocytes, Exacerbating Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques with progressively increasing reactive astrocytes characterize Alzhemer's disease (AD). Reactive astrocytes are regulated by cellular and molecular mechanisms that are known to progress A{beta} pathology. However, the metabolic adaptation and metabolites required to fuel these molecular changes in reactive astrocytes remain unknown. Using human AD samples, in vivo amyloid mouse models, and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that reactive astrocytes utilize glutamine to fuel anaplerosis and meet their metabolic demands, thereby progressing amyloidosis. We show that reactive astrocytes increase Na+-coupled neutral amino acid transporters for glutamine uptake that are interdependent on Na+/K+ ATPase. Furthermore, increasing brain-glutamine levels with a high-glutamine diet exacerbated reactive astrocytes, increasing A{beta} burden in an amyloid mouse model. We demonstrate that glutamine undergoes glutaminolysis via glutaminase-2/glutamate dehydrogenase-1 enzymes to be incorporated into TCA metabolites for anaplerosis. Pharmacologically or genetically blocking glutaminolysis reduces reactive astrocytes and decreases A{beta} pathology in an amyloid mouse. Our findings reveal the first glutamine-dependent metabolic adaptation of reactive astrocytes affecting A{beta} pathology, which may be harnessed for AD therapeutic strategies.

">Canagliflozin reprograms the aging hippocampus in genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice and attenuates Alzheimer's-like pathology</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the strongest risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the mechanisms underlying brain aging and their modulation by pharmacological interventions remain poorly defined. The hippocampus, essential for learning and memory, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic stress and inflammation. Canagliflozin (Cana), an FDA-approved sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) for type 2 diabetes, extends lifespan in male but not female mice, but its impact on brain aging is unknown. Here, we used a multi-omics strategy integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to investigate how chronic Cana treatment reprograms brain aging in genetically diverse UM-HET3 mice. In males, Cana induced mitochondrial function, insulin and cGMP-PKG signaling, and suppressed neuroinflammatory networks across all molecular layers, resulting in improved hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In females, transcriptional activation of neuroprotective pathways did not translate to protein or metabolite-level changes and failed to rescue cognition. In the 5xFAD AD model, Cana reduced amyloid plaque burden, microgliosis, and memory deficits in males only, despite comparable peripheral glucose improvements in both sexes. Our study reveals sex-specific remodeling of hippocampal aging by a clinically available SGLT2i, with implications for AD pathology and lifespan extension, and highlights Cana's potential to combat brain aging and AD through sex-specific mechanisms.

">A Reappraisal of the Role of the Mammillothalamic Tract in Memory Deficits Following Stroke in the Thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus, traditionally viewed as a sensory relay station, is now recognized for its critical role in higher-order cognitive functions, including memory. While most research has focused on its distinct nuclei, the thalamus also contains crucial white matter tracts, such as the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), part of the Papez circuit. Despite its established role in memory, the MTT remains underappreciated in studies on the cognitive role of the thalamus, increasing the risk of misattributing memory functions to nearby thalamic nuclei. This study investigates the memory impact of thalamic strokes by considering disruption to the MTT. We examined 40 patients with chronic ischemic thalamic lesions and 45 healthy controls using neuropsychological assessments, focusing on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and high-resolution structural neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques, such as symptom mapping and disconnectome analyses, were employed to analyze the relationships between lesion sites, tract disconnections and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, the expression of calbindin-rich matrix cells and parvalbumin-rich core cells was examined to assess how the connectivity property of thalamic cells, and its disruption, can relate to cognitive deficits following a thalamic stroke. Patients with left-sided thalamic lesions, especially those involving the MTT, showed significant memory impairments. Symptom mapping identified a specific cluster of lesioned voxels in the left anterior-lateral thalamus, including the MTT, as being strongly associated with poorer memory performance. Disconnectome analysis confirmed that verbal memory deficits were associated with disruption of the MTT. Furthermore, a striking overlap was observed between the critical regions linked to memory deficits and calbindin-rich thalamic areas. However, this calbindin-rich region was also disrupted in patients without memory impairment, revealing that MTT disruption, and not lesions to this region, induced memory deficits in these patients. The identified FCSRT deficit cluster overlapped with brain regions consistently linked to memory processes following fMRI meta-analytic mapping of memory-related keywords. These findings challenge the traditional focus on thalamic nuclei and connector hubs, indicating a need to reappraise the importance of the MTT in memory impairment after a thalamic stroke. This study advocates for a shift in thalamic research, emphasizing the need to investigate tract-specific contributions and disruptions of the MTT but also of other tracts such as the interthalamic adhesion or amygdalo-fugal pathway, rather than holding only to a "nuclei-centric" view of the thalamus.

">Two Specialized Intrinsic Cardiac Neuron Types Safeguard Heart Homeostasis and Stress Resilience</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS), often referred to as 'the little brain on the heart', plays a central role in heart-brain communication and is increasingly recognized as both a contributor to cardiac disorders, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, and a growing target for therapeutic intervention. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular and functional organization of the ICNS remains poorly understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, high-resolution imaging, and cell-specific genetic tools in mice, we identified two molecularly distinct intrinsic cardiac neuron (ICN) subtypes marked by Npy and Ddah1, each exhibiting unique anatomical innervation patterns. Npy ICNs function as parasympathetic postganglionic neurons essential for maintaining coronary perfusion and cardiac homeostasis during routine physiological activity. In contrast, Ddah1 ICNs are crucial for preserving cardiac electrical stability and preventing sudden death under extreme stress. These findings uncover specialized ICNS pathways that support cardiac homeostasis and resilience, providing a foundation for developing targeted neurocardiac therapies for autonomic dysfunction in human heart disease.

">Increased Synapse Elimination by Inflammatory Cells Contributes to Long-lasting Post-Stroke Memory Dysfunction in Old Mice</a></h4>

              
                Old patients are more likely to experience memory dysfunction than young patients after a stroke. It has been reported that brain astrocytes and microglia cause excessive removal of synapses at the acute and subacute stages of stroke, and inhibition of their phagocytosis improved neurobehavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that memory dysfunction in old subjects is associated with increased synapse removal by inflammatory cells. Ischemic stroke was induced in young (2-month-old) and old (15-18-month-old) mice. Memory functions were analyzed by the Y-maze test weekly for 8 weeks and the novel object recognition (NOR) test at 7 days before and 8 weeks post-stroke. We have also created a tibia fracture 6 hours before stroke injury in young mice, to test if the activation of 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchRs) reduces inflammatory cells and synapse elimination. Brains were collected 8 weeks after the induction of ischemic stroke. Transcriptome changes, neuronal injuries, neuroinflammation, synapse removal, and neurite outgrowth were analyzed. We found that old mice developed long-term memory dysfunction after ischemic stroke, which was not seen in young mice. Old mice showed larger infarct volume, higher neuroinflammation, and more synapses engulfed by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the peri-atrophic region and hippocampi than young mice. More synapse-engulfing astrocytes than microglia/macrophages were present in the peri-atrophic region and the ipsilateral hippocampi, suggesting that reactive astrocytes contributed more than activated microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Activation of 7-nAchRs in mice subjected to tibia fracture 6 hours before ischemic injury reduced synapse removal by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the hippocampi. Our study indicated that an increase in synaptic elements by inflammatory cells contributes to the long-lasting memory deficit after stroke in old mice. Astrocytes may contribute more than microglia/macrophages in synapse removal. Inhibition of neuroinflammation by activating 7-nAchRs can reduce synapse loss and thus may improve post-stroke memory function.

">The vagus nerve promotes memory via septo-hippocampal acetylcholine: Implications for obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerve relays critical metabolic information between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain. Recent findings highlight a role for vagus nerve-mediated gut-brain signaling in regulating higher-order cognitive processes, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that nutrient consumption promotes hippocampal-dependent memory function via vagus nerve-mediated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsal hippocampus (HPCd) from medial septum (MS) neurons. In vivo analyses reveal that HPCd ACh release is engaged during nutrient consumption, and that this response is abolished in animals that received MS cholinergic neuron ablation, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV), or early-life Western Diet (WD) maintenance. MS cholinergic neuron ablation, SDV, and early-life WD also impaired memory for meal location, suggesting that this gut-brain pathway functions to encode memories for eating events. Collectively, results identify a neurobiological mechanism whereby nutrient consumption promotes memory function, and reveal that disruption of this vagal-brain signaling system mediates WD-associated memory impairments.

">Sex-dependent effects of maternal high-fat diet during lactation in adult THY-Tau22 mice offspring</a></h4>

              
                The perinatal environment has been suggested to participate to the development of tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease but the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved remain contradictory and under-investigated. Here, we evaluated the effects of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) during lactation on the development of tauopathy in the THY-Tau22 mouse strain, a model of progressive tau pathology associated with cognitive decline. During lactation, dams were fed either a chow diet (13.6% of fat) or a HFD (58% of fat). At weaning, offspring was fed a chow diet until sacrifice at 4 months of age (the onset of tau pathology) or 7 months of age (the onset of cognitive impairment). During lactation, maternal HFD increased body weight gain in offspring. At 3 months of age, maternal HFD led to a mild glucose intolerance only in male offspring. Moreover, it impaired spatial memory in both male and female 6-month-old offspring, with males being more impacted. These cognitive deficits were associated with increased phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein-observed at 4 months in males and at 7 months in females, highlighting a sex-specific temporal shift. Additionally, maternal HFD modified adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), leading to an increase of mature neuronal cells number in females and of dendritic arborization length in males. Synaptic analysis further revealed that maternal HFD led to synaptic loss only in males. Finally, multi-omics approaches showed that maternal HFD has long-term consequences on both transcriptome, proteome and regulome, this effect being also sex-dependent with mitochondrial pathways, ribosomal activity, cilium and the extracellular matrix predominantly impacted in males, while gliogenesis, myelination and synaptic plasticity were primarily affected in females. Regulome analysis suggested that this sex-dependent phenotype was more related to a temporal shift rather than distinct sex-specific alterations. Collectively, our data suggest that maternal malnutrition accelerates the development of tauopathy in THY-Tau22 offspring, with sex-dependent effects, males being impacted earlier than females. These findings highlight the critical role of the perinatal environment as a key window of opportunity for interventions aimed at preventing the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

">Generation of knock-in Cre and FlpO mouse lines for precise targeting of striatal projection neurons and dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia and midbrain dopaminergic systems are critical for motor control, reward processing, and reinforcement learning, with dysfunction in these systems implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. To enable precise genetic targeting of key neuronal populations, we generated and characterized five knock-in mouse lines: Drd1-Cre, Adora2a-Cre, Drd1-FlpO, Adora2a-FlpO, and DAT-FlpO. These lines allow for Cre- or FlpO-mediated recombination in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs), adenosine A2a receptor-expressing SPNs, and dopamine transporter (DAT)-expressing neurons in the midbrain. Histological analyses confirmed recombinase activity in expected brain regions, and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings validated the intrinsic excitability profiles of each neuronal subpopulation. These tools provide high specificity and reliability for studying basal ganglia circuitry and dopaminergic neurons. By enabling targeted manipulations, these openly available knock-in lines will advance research into the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, reward, and neuropsychiatric diseases.

">Structurally Constrained Functional Connectivity Reveals Efficient Visuomotor Decision-Making Mechanisms in Action Video Gamers</a></h4>

              
                Long-term action video game (AVG) playing has been linked to improved response times (~190 ms) without accuracy tradeoffs in time-sensitive visuomotor decisions, but how it reshapes neural circuits is unclear. In this study, Cognitive Resource Reallocation (CRR) is introduced as a candidate mechanism for how sustained engagement with AVGs drives behaviorally relevant neuroplasticity through neuroplastic refinement. Using the AAL3 structural connectivity atlas, we apply structural constraints to functional connectivity (SC-FC) and directed functional connectivity (SC-dFC) in gamers and non-gamers. Our results provide strong support for the CRR hypothesis and demonstrate that the brain plausibly reallocates cognitive resources over time to optimize task-relevant networks in high-demand environments like AVGs, enhancing the integration of contextual information and refining motion processing, which may be a key mechanism in explaining more efficient visuomotor decision-making. These findings position action video games as powerful tools for studying experience-driven neuroplasticity, with implications for cognitive training, rehabilitation, and optimizing real-world visuomotor decisions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in cognitive functions, in mood- and anxiety-related behaviors, and in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Augmenting α5-γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor function has shown neurotrophic effects in stress and aged models, but its impact on mouse AHN remains unknown. Adult male 129S6/SvEvTac mice (<i>n</i> = 30 total) were treated for 6 weeks with GL-II-73, an α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator (α5-PAM) [30 mg/kg, per os, (P.O.)] or fluoxetine, a prototypical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to increase AHN (18 mg/kg, P.O.). Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) was assessed by the level of Ki67, a marker of dividing cells; survival of the young neurons was assessed by retention of the 5-Bromo-2´-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) nucleotide analog injected 2 weeks before sacrifice. Finally, maturation of young adult-born neurons was evaluated by measuring the fraction of BrdU-positive cells that are also DCX and/or NeuN-positive, capturing overall maturation and speed of maturation. Similarly to fluoxetine, a chronic treatment with GL-II-73 stimulated all stages of AHN, significantly increasing neuronal progenitor proliferation, survival of adult-born granule cells, and maturation of young neurons in the DG of the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with GL-II-73, a α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator, increased AHN, including cellular proliferation, survival, and maturation of newborn neurons, to levels comparable to fluoxetine.</p>

                Mitotic proteins are traditionally studied for their role in chromosome segregation during cell division. However, research increasingly highlights the important non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins beyond mitosis, particularly in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Alterations in the expression levels or mutations of mitotic proteins are increasingly linked to brain disorders such as primary microcephaly and Alzheimer’s disease. A central, unresolved question remains: how do mitotic proteins contribute to neuronal pathogenesis? Here, we review emerging literature on the non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins in mature neurons. Additionally, we discuss how these contribute to the complex mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We also discuss their potential for identifying therapeutic strategies and as biomarkers in brain pathologies.

                Ward and Crawford et al. demonstrate that IL-33 is lost from malignant skin epithelia and that its receptor, ST2, is predominantly expressed on skin Tregs. IL-33/ST2 signals tissue damage to skin Tregs, which promote de novo epithelial development and thus decrease the mutational load and restrain carcinogenesis upon exposure to environmental carcinogens.

                Traveling waves represent patterns of neural activity in the brain. Haigh et al. demonstrate that motor excitability measured with EEG-controlled TMS is dependent on both the location of stimulation and the phase of the neural oscillation. This reveals an important functional relationship between motor excitability and endogenous traveling waves.

                Pomberger et al. show that the mouse posterior insula encodes vocal expression and reception in a socially sensitive manner. Largely distinct neuronal populations respond during vocal production and listening, with modulation shaped by social context and sensory cues. Anatomical tracing links the insula to key auditory and vocal motor structures.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Smartphones have become integral to daily life, and their overuse can lead to various maladaptive behaviors and decision-making patterns. This study investigated the neural and computational mechanisms underlying smartphone addiction, focusing on its impact on loss-aversion decision-making. We combined computational models, such as the Drift Diffusion Model, with a novel analytic approach, intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). Behavioral results showed that higher smartphone addiction symptom (SAS) scores were correlated with reduced loss-aversion (lnλ), while the drift rate was positively associated with SAS. Furthermore, the drift rate mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SAS was associated with increased gain-related activity in the occipital pole (OP) but decreased activity in the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Additionally, reduced activity was observed in the angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus during loss processing. IS-RSA further identified brain activation patterns in the default mode network, frontoparietal network, visual network, and sensorimotor network, which corresponded to intersubject variations in SAS, particularly during gain processing but not during loss processing. These patterns were also observed when gains and losses were processed simultaneously. Mediation analyses indicated that brain activation strengths in the OP, precuneus, and MFG during gain processing mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ and drift rate. Similar mediation effects were observed for intersubject variations in SAS and computational process patterns (eg decision threshold, drift rate, and nondecision time) within these networks. These findings provide novel insights into the neural and computational mechanisms of loss aversion in smartphone addiction, with implications for understanding cognitive biases and informing interventions for addictive behaviors.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two kinds of serious psychiatric disorders. Despite different diagnostic criteria, the patients have significant biologic and clinical overlaps, challenging for the early identification, diagnosis, intervention, and management of these two diseases. Given the limited research on interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we included 38 schizophrenia patients, 34 bipolar disorder patients and 57 HCs from a publicly available fMRI dataset to investigate it across the whole brain by using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Correlation analyses were also performed to examine the associations between VMHC values, clinical symptoms, and neuropsychological tests. Our findings revealed that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder shared the functional alteration in the insula, exhibiting decreased VMHC compared to HCs, but the specific regions differed: bipolar disorder demonstrated alternations in the inferior occipital gyrus, while schizophrenia showed changes in the postcentral gyrus. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed decreased VMHC relative to HCs. These alterations correlated with clinical symptoms, underscoring the importance of these brain regions in mental diseases. Our research provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases, suggesting that interhemispheric functional disconnection might critically contribute to the development and maintenance of these psychiatric disorders.</span>

                Background Uterine rupture (UR) remains a major cause of maternal morbidity, especially in low-resource settings. While typically detected during labor, some cases are clinically silent, discovered incidentally during imaging/surgery, highlighting a knowledge gap in risk assessment. In Tunisia, 1.5% of pregnancies involve UR, mostly scar-related. The study aim was to identify factors associated with the development of complete UR in cases that were incidentally found during pregnancy or delivery. Methods This was retrospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted over an eleven-year period, from January 2014 to December 2024, at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics department B, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Asymptomatic UR cases (complete/incomplete) were analysed to compare clinical profiles, identify risk factors, and assess maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results A total of 41 cases of asymptomatic UR were included, which accounted for an average of 50% of the UR cases. In a cohort comparing complete UR cases (N=27) and incomplete UR cases (N=14), significant differences in duration of pregnancy and labor were found. The mean gestational age was longer in the incomplete UR group (p=0.03), and the duration of labor was also significantly longer (p=0.006). No significant differences were observed in sociodemographic characteristics, quality of prenatal care, or complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Nonsignificant factors included pregnancy interval, scars number and labor stagnation. The analysis showed two significant predictors of complete UR outcomes. Prolonged labor (>220 minutes) was strongly associated with increased odds of complete UR (OR=45.231, 95% CI=2.591-789.486, p=0.009) and lower maternal weight (<68 kg) correlated with reduced odds of incomplete UR (OR=0.033, 95% CI=0.001–0.837, p=0.039), suggesting a protective effect per kilogram decrease. Conclusion Findings redefine UR as part of a broader clinical spectrum, not just an acute complication, enabling tailored surveillance and improved prevention in high-risk pregnancies.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of high prevalence worldwide. It usually coexists with chondyslipidemia, obesity and hypertension and can present complications such as peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy. Method Retrospective cohort study of 441 patients with diabetes mellitus 2. Medical records were reviewed to obtain the variables under study. All patients of both sexes treated between July 2023 and November 2024 in a primary care hospital were included and patients on predialysis or dialysis, total or partial lower limb amputation, and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used. Results Among the signs of DN, anhidrosis and mycosis predominated in patients of both sexes, and among the symptoms, burning, prickling and leg pain when walking. The majority of patients with neuropathy are between 60 and 79 years of age, female, have hypertension, have a disease duration of 12.83 ± 8.73 years, Hb1Ac of 7.67% ±1.69, glucose of 153.93 ± 66.17 and hemoglobin of 12.98 ± 1.39. Most patients have CKD G1 and G2. The Chi-square test indicates only relationship between age group, sex and stages. In the quantitative analysis, the Krustall Wallis test indicates that there are significant differences in patient stages according to age, time of disease and HbA1c. Conclusions G1 and G2 stages, female sex and hypertension predominated in patients with CKD. The older the patient and the longer the time with diabetes, the higher the CKD stage. There is a relationship with age group, sex and CKD stages. Age < 79 years and the absence of hypertension are protective factors for the progression of CKD and male sex is considered a risk factor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-582/v1?src=rss">The Limits of AI in Understanding Emotions: Challenges in Bridging Human Experience and Machine Perception [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace the human factor in the analysis of emotions within financial decision-making contexts. The background of this study is as follows: growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence for text analysis, understanding its capacity to detect emotional patterns is particularly relevant in fields where emotional dynamics significantly influence behavior, such as trading. Method Our research method is based on a three-day trading experiment involving students, during which participants made decisions under conditions of uncertainty. At the end of the experiment, each participant wrote a free-form report describing their emotional experience. We applied four different Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze these texts and compared the results with those obtained through a traditional lexical analysis method. AI tools provided relatively consistent and coherent assessments of the general emotional tone in the texts. Results Our results suggest that they successfully identified dominant emotions such as fear, disappointment, and hope. However, the ability of Artificial Intelligence to detect more nuanced or mixed emotional states was limited. In contrast, traditional lexical analysis offered greater sensitivity to emotional complexity. Although both approaches converged on broad emotional tendencies, divergences appeared when addressing subtle or context-specific emotional shifts. Our findings suggest that AI can serve as a useful preliminary tool in the analysis of emotions in written texts, especially for identifying dominant patterns. Conclusion In conclusion, according to us, due to its limitations in detecting emotional nuances, Artificial Intelligence should be integrated into a hybrid analytical approach. Combining Artificial Intelligence with traditional or human-led analysis enhances both the precision and depth of interpretation. We argue that a hybrid model avoids the oversimplification of emotional data and better reflects the complexity of emotional dynamics in decision-making under uncertainty.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                <p>by Ismael Jaras, Marcos E. Orchard, Pedro E. Maldonado, Rodrigo C. Vergara</p>

Understanding the intricate interplay between neural dynamics and metabolic constraints is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of the brain. Despite the significance of this relationship, specific details concerning the impact of metabolism on neuronal dynamics and neural network architecture remain elusive, creating a notable gap in the existing literature. This study employs an energy-dependent neuron and plasticity model to analyze the role of local metabolic constraints in shaping both the dynamics and structure of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Specifically, an energy-dependent version of the leaky integrate-and-fire model is utilized, along with a three-factor learning rule that incorporates postsynaptic available energy as the third factor. These models allow for fine-tuning sensitivity in the presence of energy imbalances. Analytical expressions predicting the network’s activity and structure are derived, and a fixed point analysis reveals the emergence of attractor states characterized by neuronal and synaptic sensitivity to energy imbalances. Analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations using an excitatory-inhibitory network. Furthermore, these simulations enable the study of SNN activity and structure under conditions simulating metabolic impairment. In conclusion, by employing energy-dependent models with adjustable sensitivity to energy imbalances, our study advances the understanding of how metabolic constraints shape SNN dynamics and structure. Moreover, in light of compelling evidence linking neuronal metabolic impairment to neurodegenerative diseases, the incorporation of local metabolic constraints into the investigation of neuronal network structure and activity opens an intriguing avenue for inspiring the development of therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Wentao Ma, Chunwu Yu</p>

Modern cell membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids, while primitive cell membranes in the beginning of life are believed to have formed from simpler lipids (such as fatty acids) synthesized in the prebiotic environment. An attractive experimental study suggested that the corresponding “membrane-takeover” (as an evolutionary process) is likely to have occurred very early (e.g., in the RNA world) due to some simple physical effects, and might have subsequently triggered some other evolutionary processes. Here, via computer modeling on a system of RNA-based protocells, we convinced the plausibility of such a scenario and elaborated on relevant mechanisms. It is shown that in protocells with a fatty-acid membrane, because of the benefit of phospholipid content (i.e., stabilizing the membrane), a ribozyme favoring the synthesis of phospholipids may emerge; subsequently, due to the reduced membrane permeability on account of the phospholipid content, two other functional RNA species could arise: a ribozyme exploiting more fundamental materials (thus more permeable) for nucleotide synthesis and a species favoring across-membrane transportation. This case exemplifies a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts regarding early evolution, which may shed light on that notoriously complicated problem: the origin of life.

                Fulton et al. identify the chromatin regulator ZBTB7A as a key driver of stress susceptibility via its actions in the astrocytes of the orbitofrontal cortex. Using cross-species epigenomic profiling and rodent models, they show that astrocytic ZBTB7A reshapes neuronal activity and behavior following stress, revealing a glial-mediated epigenetic mechanism of depression vulnerability.

                The global spread of misinformation is undermining democracies worldwide. In this NeuroView, we explain how neuroscience can inform our basic understanding of what makes the brain susceptible to false information, how it spreads in society, and how neuroscience can help shape and optimize interventions to effectively counter it.
