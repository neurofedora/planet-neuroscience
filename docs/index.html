                <p>The annual Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meeting is a bonanza of scientific achievement: famous keynote speakers, beautiful scientific results, and award ceremonies. This focus is exciting and invigorating but glosses over the many failures, mistakes, and rejections that typically lead to scientific success. Our goal has been to create a space within the annual SfN meeting for open conversation about scientific failure and, by doing so, increase transparency, resilience, and mental well-being within our community. In this article, we share the materials that we have used at SfN during the past 4&nbsp;years (2021&ndash;2024) to promote discussions of scientific failure, including formal storytelling, individual and interactive games, and confessionals. For each activity, we provide the rationale and practical guidance regarding logistics and usage. We hope this will aid scientists interested in adapting the activities for their own communities or local events. We end with a call for scientific institutions to commit to providing space for open discussions of failure within their educational programs and conferences.</p>

                <p>Neurons adapt to chronic activity changes by modifying synaptic properties, including neurotransmitter release. However, whether neuropeptide release via dense core vesicles (DCVs)&mdash;a distinct regulated secretory pathway&mdash;undergoes similar adaptation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 24&nbsp;h action potential blockade leads to significant DCV accumulation in primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Reactivation with action potential trains induced enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and 700% more DCV exocytosis compared with control neurons. Notably, total DCV cargo protein levels were unchanged, while mRNA levels of corresponding genes were reduced. Blocking neurotransmitter release with Tetanus toxin induced DCV accumulation, similar to that induced by network silencing with TTX. Hence, chronic network silencing triggers increased DCV accumulation due to reduced exocytosis during silencing. These accumulated DCVs can be released upon reactivation resulting in a massive potentiation of DCV exocytosis, possibly contributing to homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-43/v2?src=rss">Income-Based analysis of health security in Western Asia through an integrated GHSI, MCDM, and Clustering Model [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background The increasing incidence of emerging infectious diseases is posing serious global threats. Therefore, there is a clear need for developing computational methods that can assist and speed up experimental research to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of microbial infections. Methods In this context, we developed mimicINT, an open-source computational workflow for large-scale protein-protein interaction inference between microbe and human by detecting putative molecular mimicry elements mediating the interaction with host proteins: short linear motifs (SLiMs) and host-like globular domains. mimicINT exploits these putative elements to infer the interaction with human proteins by using known templates of domain-domain and SLiM-domain interaction templates. mimicINT also provides (i) robust Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of SLiM detection which suffers from false positives, and (ii) an interaction specificity filter to account for differences between motif-binding domains of the same family. We have also made mimicINT available via a web server. Results In two use cases, mimicINT can identify potential interfaces in experimentally detected interaction between pathogenic Escherichia coli type-3 secreted effectors and human proteins and infer biologically relevant interactions between Marburg virus and human proteins. Conclusions The mimicINT workflow can be instrumental to better understand the molecular details of microbe-host interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-245/v2?src=rss">Research on Olympic medal prediction based on GA-BP and logistic regression model [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-347/v1?src=rss">Skill and Strategy: How Managerial Ability Drives Working Capital Efficiency [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study investigates the impact of Managerial Ability (MA) on Working Capital Management Efficiency (WCME), focusing on how skilled management influences working capital practices. It also explores the variation in this relationship across firms with different characteristics such as profitability and market valuations within India’s economic landscape. Methods Using a balanced panel dataset of 150 listed companies from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India for the period 2014–2023, the study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). WCME is assessed as a multidimensional efficiency metric incorporating inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cost of goods sold , net revenue, and net income. MA is estimated using a two-step DEA-based approach, separating managerial ability from firm-specific characteristics. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) regression models are applied to examine the individual and interactive effects of MA and Tobin’s Q (TBQ) on WCME along with other important variables. Results The results demonstrate that MA significantly enhances WCME, particularly in firms with lower TBQ. The analysis also reveals that skilled managerial characteristics amplifies the efficiency of working capital management, aligning with the Upper Echelon Theory's (UET) claim that managerial attributes play a critical role in organizational efficiency. Conclusion The study demonstrates managerial ability has a strong influence on corporate working capital policies. This advocates prevalence of certain fundamental concepts such as viz. Upper Echelon Theory (UET), Resource-Based View (RBV), and Agency Theory (AT). From managerial point of view, it is suggested to adopt strategic approaches in practicing WCME that will enhance firm’s competitive advantage and long-term sustainability.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-346/v1?src=rss">Assessing neuroinflammation in vitro in a microglial model: advancing cannabinoid-based therapeutic insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the progression of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as chronic pain. It is characterized by elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and TNF-α, by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Emerging research highlights the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in neuroinflammation, proposing cannabinoids as potential therapeutic agents owing to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods This study used an in vitro model, specifically the BV-2 murine microglial cell line, to assess neuroinflammation. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay, and cytokine production was quantified using advanced nanobiosensor technologies, including Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to evaluate protein expression. Microglial cells were treated with varying concentrations of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-SP), cannabidiol (CBD), a full-spectrum tetrahydrocannabinol (FSE-THC) extract (70% THC), or a combination of the two at a 1:1 ratio (FSE-THC/CBD). Results The treatments did not affect BV-2 microglial cell viability. Nitric oxide (NO) production remained unaltered following treatment with Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC 70%, or FSE-THC:CBD in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. However, CBD and FSE-THC:CBD significantly reduced TNF-α levels, whereas Dex-SP and CBD decreased IL-6 expression. Furthermore, Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC (70%), and FSE-THC:CBD modulated the activation of Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α, IFN-γ, NF-κB, and iNOS in concentration- and treatment-specific manners. Conclusions Dex-SPs demonstrate acute anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Specific cannabinoids at particular concentrations exhibit comparable or superior efficacy in modulating key inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in neuroinflammation, and emphasize the need for further investigation to optimize their application.

                The fields of epidemiology and viral phylodynamics share the ultimate goal of disease control, but concepts, methodologies and data employed by each differ in ways that confer complementary strengths and different areas of weakness. We recently introduced EpiFusion, a model for joint inference of outbreak characteristics using phylogenetic and case incidence data via particle filtering and demonstrated its usage to infer the effective reproduction number of simulated and real outbreaks. Here we provide a series of vignettes demonstrating data analysis using the EpiFusion Analysis Framework, consisting of the R package EpiFusionUtilities and the Java program in which the model is implemented, including an example using a new feature incorporated since EpiFusion’s last description: the option to provide a phylogenetic tree posterior as the phylogenetic data input to the program. By outlining these examples, we aim to improve the usability of our model, and promote workflow reproducibility and open research.

                Background Motivational variables are of critical importance concerning students' performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate the interrelationships between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, critical thinking, and academic performance among university students. Methods The participants were 250 students enrolled in university programs in education and psychology. The research instrument was a self-report questionnaire designed to assess intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking, self-regulation, and academic achievement among university students. A path model analysis was employed to identify the relationships among the investigated variables. Results The results demonstrated that self-efficacy was predicted by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking was predicted by self-efficacy, and self-regulation was predicted by self-efficacy and critical thinking, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of self-efficacy. The findings indicate that academic achievement is predicted by critical thinking, and self-regulation, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of these variables in academic contexts. Conclusions The contributions of the present research are twofold, both theoretical and practical. On the one hand, the findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections between motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and self-regulation. On the other hand, they provide valuable insights for developing educational strategies that enhance academic achievement by fostering these key factors.

                <p>by Barry Ryan, Riccardo Marioni, T. Ian Simpson</p>

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Currently, there is no cure for the disease which is in part due to the heterogeneity in patient symptoms, trajectories and manifestations. There is a known genetic component of PD and genomic datasets have helped to uncover some aspects of the disease. Understanding the longitudinal variability of PD is essential as it has been theorised that there are different triggers and underlying disease mechanisms at different points during disease progression. In this paper, we perform longitudinal and cross-sectional experiments to identify which data modalities or combinations of modalities are informative at different time points. We use clinical, genomic, and proteomic data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We validate the importance of flexible data integration by highlighting the varying combinations of data modalities for optimal stratification at different disease stages in idiopathic PD. We show there is a shared signal in the DNAm signatures of participants with a mutation in a causal gene of PD and participants with idiopathic PD. We also show that integration of SNPs and DNAm data modalities has potential for use as an early diagnostic tool for individuals with a genetic cause of PD.

                <p>by Raheel Asghar, Nan Wu, Noman Ali, Yulei Wang, Mahinur Akkaya</p>

Understanding the biological functions of <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) effectors is fundamental for uncovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity and variability, thereby paving the way for developing durable and effective control strategies for stripe rust. However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in <i>Pst</i>, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve <i>Pst</i> races or isolates, a <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> isolate, and one <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between <i>Pst</i> effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on <i>Pst</i> effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of <i>Pst</i> pathogenicity and evolution.

                <p>by David Acunzo, Damiano Grignolio, Clayton Hickey</p>

The visual environment is complicated, and humans and other animals accordingly prioritize some sources of information over others through the deployment of spatial attention. Cognitive theories propose that one core purpose of this is to gather information that can be used in downstream cognitive processes, including the development of concepts and categories. However, neuroscientific investigation has focused closely on the identification of the systems and algorithms that support attentional control or that instantiate the effect of attention on sensation and perception. Much less is known about how attention impacts the acquisition and activation of concepts. Here, we use machine learning of EEG and concurrently recorded EEG/MRI to temporally and anatomically characterize the neural network that abstracts from attended perceptual information to activate and construct semantic and conceptual representations. We find that variance in the amplitude of N2pc—an event-related potential (ERP) component closely linked to selective attention—predicts the emergence of conceptual information in a network including VMPFC, posterior parietal cortex, and anterior insula. This network appears to play a key role in the attention-mediated translation of perceptual information to concepts, semantics, and action plans.

                TDP-43 pathology characterizes neurodegenerative diseases. Scialò et al. use in vitro-generated and patient-derived TDP-43 aggregates as seeds to show that seed-induced TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation causes its loss of function and downstream RNA misregulation. This new cell model shows TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function without overexpression or knockdown.

                Rummens et al. demonstrate that amyloid-like fibrils trigger TDP-43 aggregation and nuclear depletion, key hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. This provokes a unique transcriptomic signature with RNA splicing defects, including disease-specific cryptic splicing in human cells. Over time, fibril-induced TDP-43 pathology recapitulates distinct aggregate shapes and causes toxicity in iPSC-derived neurons.

                Xia et al. identify a mechanism of ovarian cancer resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) that involves arginine methylation of METTL3 by PRMT5, leading to enhanced HR-mediated DSBR. MST4 activates PRMT5 through direct phosphorylation. Inhibition of PRMT5 or METTL3 disrupts HR-DSBR and augments the cytotoxic effects of CDDP in ovarian tumor xenografts.

They find that the stoichiometry of antibody binding is the primary determinant of FcγRIIIa signaling and immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, while epitope location and binding kinetics have minimal impact.

                Thakur et al. find that the lipid transfer protein PDZD8 induces synaptic growth. Through in vivo studies, the authors find that PDZD8 functions at neuronal ER-late endosome/lysosome membrane contact sites to promote lysosome maturation and accelerate autophagic flux. Increased autophagy in turn induces activity-dependent synapse formation.

Now, optical control is demonstrated over a key enzyme involved in animal cell division, and a diverse array of dynamic cell shapes is achieved by biochemically hacking an endogenous signalling circuit.

A decade-long effort to simulate QED on a two-dimensional lattice has now succeeded — through the use of a trapped-ion quantum computer based on multidimensional ‘qudits’, which are uniquely suited to the challenge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100527">A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate ‘vectorized’ forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101103">3D reconstruction of neuronal allometry and neuromuscular projections in asexual planarians using expansion tiling light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The intricate coordination of the neural network in planarian growth and regeneration has remained largely unrevealed, partly due to the challenges of imaging the CNS in three dimensions (3D) with high resolution and within a reasonable timeframe. To address this gap in systematic imaging of the CNS in planarians, we adopted high-resolution, nanoscale imaging by combining tissue expansion and tiling light-sheet microscopy, achieving up to fourfold linear expansion. Using an automatic 3D cell segmentation pipeline, we quantitatively profiled neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians during homeostasis and regeneration. We validated previous observations of neuronal cell number changes and muscle fiber distribution. We found that the increase in neuron cell number tends to lag behind the rapid expansion of somatic cells during the later phase of homeostasis. By imaging the planarian with up to 120 nm resolution, we also observed distinct muscle distribution patterns at the anterior and posterior poles. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of <i>β-catenin-1</i> RNAi on muscle fiber distribution at the posterior pole, consistent with changes in anterior-posterior polarity. The glial cells were observed to be close in contact with dorsal-ventral muscle fibers. Finally, we observed disruptions in neural-muscular networks in <i>inr-1</i> RNAi planarians. These findings provide insights into the detailed structure and potential functions of the neural-muscular system in planarians and highlight the accessibility of our imaging tool in unraveling the biological functions underlying their diverse phenotypes and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100390">Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range</a></h4>

              
                The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97579">Dimeric R25CPTH(1–34) activates the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor in vitro and stimulates bone formation in osteoporotic female mice</a></h4>

              
                Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone density and strength, increases fracture risk, pain, and limits mobility. Established therapies of parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs effectively promote bone formation and reduce fractures in severe osteoporosis, but their use is limited by potential adverse effects. In the pursuit of safer osteoporosis treatments, we investigated <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, a PTH variant wherein the native arginine at position 25 is substituted by cysteine. These studies were prompted by our finding of high bone mineral density in a hypoparathyroidism patient with the R25C homozygous mutation, and we explored its effects on PTH type-1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in cells and bone metabolism in mice. Our findings indicate that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) forms dimers both intracellularly and extracellularly, and the synthetic dimeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), exhibits altered activity in PTH1R-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) response. Upon a single injection in mice, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) induced acute calcemic and phosphaturic responses comparable to PTH(1–34). Furthermore, repeated daily injections increased calvarial bone thickness in intact mice and improved trabecular and cortical bone parameters in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, akin to PTH(1–34). The overall results reveal a capacity of a dimeric PTH peptide ligand to activate the PTH1R in vitro and in vivo as PTH, suggesting a potential path of therapeutic PTH analog development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96941">Compositional editing of extracellular matrices by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal stem cell lines</a></h4>

              
                Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECMs), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knock out vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification, and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road toward the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100478">Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105005">Functionally important residues from graph analysis of coevolved dynamic couplings</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between protein dynamics and function is essential for understanding biological processes and developing effective therapeutics. Functional sites within proteins are critical for activities such as substrate binding, catalysis, and structural changes. Existing computational methods for the predictions of functional residues are trained on sequence, structural, and experimental data, but they do not explicitly model the influence of evolution on protein dynamics. This overlooked contribution is essential as it is known that evolution can fine-tune protein dynamics through compensatory mutations either to improve the proteins’ performance or diversify its function while maintaining the same structural scaffold. To model this critical contribution, we introduce DyNoPy, a computational method that combines residue coevolution analysis with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing hidden correlations between functional sites. DyNoPy constructs a graph model of residue–residue interactions, identifies communities of key residue groups, and annotates critical sites based on their roles. By leveraging the concept of coevolved dynamical couplings—residue pairs with critical dynamical interactions that have been preserved during evolution—DyNoPy offers a powerful method for predicting and analysing protein evolution and dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyNoPy on SHV-1 and PDC-3, chromosomally encoded β-lactamases linked to antibiotic resistance, highlighting its potential to inform drug design and address pressing healthcare challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100002">Deciphering the preeclampsia-specific immune microenvironment and the role of pro-inflammatory macrophages at the maternal–fetal interface</a></h4>

              
                Preeclampsia (PE), a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality with highly heterogeneous causes and symptoms, is usually complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, a comprehensive understanding of the immune microenvironment in the placenta of PE and the differences between PE and GDM is still lacking. In this study, cytometry by time of flight indicated that the frequencies of memory-like Th17 cells (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>IL-17A<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>), memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD38<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>−</sup>CD127<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) and pro-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>−</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD38<sup>mid</sup>CD107a<sup>low</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>HLA-DR<sup>mid</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) were increased, while the frequencies of anti-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) and granulocyte myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>low</sup>) were decreased in the placenta of PE compared with that of normal pregnancy (NP), but not in that of GDM or GDM&amp;PE. The pro-inflam Macs were positively correlated with memory-like Th17 cells and memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but negatively correlated with gMDSCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that transferring the F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>−</sup> pro-inflam Macs with a Folr2<sup>+</sup>Ccl7<sup>+</sup>Ccl8<sup>+</sup>C1qa<sup>+</sup>C1qb<sup>+</sup>C1qc<sup>+</sup> phenotype from the uterus of PE mice to normal pregnant mice induced the production of memory-like IL-17a<sup>+</sup>Rora<sup>+</sup>Il1r1<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup>Cxcr6<sup>+</sup>S100a4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells via IGF1–IGF1R, which contributed to the development and recurrence of PE. Pro-inflam Macs also induced the production of memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but inhibited the production of Ly6g<sup>+</sup>S100a8<sup>+</sup>S100a9<sup>+</sup>Retnlg<sup>+</sup>Wfdc21<sup>+</sup> gMDSCs at the maternal–fetal interface, leading to PE-like symptoms in mice. In conclusion, this study revealed the PE-specific immune cell network, which was regulated by pro-inflam Macs, providing new ideas about the pathogenesis of PE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98896">Natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio reveals SR3G as a negative regulator of root suberization and salt resilience in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoots growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <span class="underline">S</span>alt <span class="underline">R</span>oot:shoot <span class="underline">R</span>atio <span class="underline">R</span>egulator <span class="underline">G</span>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <i>SR3G</i> expression is modulated by <i>WRKY75</i> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <i>wrky75</i> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <i>sr3g</i> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of a new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99957">The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time’s cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent’s discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit’s properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time’s apportionment—specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit—which we term the ‘Malapportionment Hypothesis’. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.

">Hsp90 buffers behavioral plasticity by regulating Pdf transcription in clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are prevalent on Earth and temporally organize behaviour and physiology of organisms to occur in species-specific 'temporal niches'. However, species differ in how strictly individuals are controlled by their circadian clock, suggesting that it may offer a selective advantage for an individual to extend its temporal niche under certain circumstances, for example during stressful environmental conditions. A potential mechanism controlling temporal niche adherence involves the evolutionary capacitor and chaperon protein HSP90, known to assist the proper folding of important signalling molecules. If HSP90 becomes rate limiting (e.g., under environmental stress) hidden genetic variation will be expressed, producing novel and potentially beneficial phenotypes for the individual. While this role of HSP90 is well established for morphological traits, we show here that it extends to regulation of temporal behavioural patterns. We show that within a small subset of clock neurons in the fly brain, HSP83, the fly homologue of HSP90, mitigates inter-individual behavioural plasticity. We provide evidence for the requirement of HSP83 for efficient transcription of the gene encoding the circadian neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), and for correct PDF accumulation in central clock neurons. Strikingly, Hsp83 mutants affect synchronized oscillations of the clock protein PERIOD (PER) in subsets of circadian clock neurons in the same way as flies without PDF, further supporting a role of Hsp83 in regulating Pdf. Our findings therefore provide a mechanistic explanation for HSP83 function in regulation of behavioural plasticity, and offer an explanation for how to restrict temporal niche extension to stressful environmental conditions.

">Dynamic structural connectivity changes in cortical and cortico-striatal strokes in mice</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a primary global health concern, leading to significant mortality and long-term disability. Beyond immediate neuronal damage, functional and structural connectivity is altered brain-wide with implications for functional deficits and recovery. It remains unclear, however, if the level of degeneration, i.e. reduced myelination and axonal damage, as well as compensatory plasticity, i.e., axonal sprouting and remyelination, depend on the lesion size and topology. This study compares for the first time two different stroke models in adult male mice, with the aim of uncovering the dynamics in white matter changes. Repetitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) over four weeks post photothrombotic cortical (1.41+/-0.92% of brain volume), and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) cortico-striatal (11.53+/-2.8% of brain volume), strokes were used to map structural connectivity changes at the whole-brain level. We quantified inter- and intra-hemispheric seed strength changes over time, with seed strength reflecting how strongly each region is connected to the rest of the brain. Differences between groups and time points were assessed using a mixed model corrected for multiple comparisons. In conclusion, large cortico-striatal lesions led increased structural connectivity in sensorimotor regions, whereas small cortical lesions induced asymmetric connectivity changes: an increase extending globally from the ischemic hemisphere and a decrease expanding globally from the healthy hemisphere. These findings highlight that stroke severity and lesion size significantly affect the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of connectivity disruptions, emphasizing the need for targeted monitoring of neural changes post-stroke.

">Aggregation of the constitutively active K296E rhodopsin mutant contributes to retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                A K296E mutation in rhodopsin causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive retinal degenerative disease. Early in vitro characterizations of this mutation studied on a bovine rhodopsin background indicated that the mutation causes the receptor to be constitutively active. This molecular defect has been the primary focus when considering the pathogenic mechanism of the mutation. Knockin mice expressing the K296E rhodopsin mutant were generated and characterized to better understand the pathogenic mechanism of the mutation. Knockin mice exhibited progressive retinal degeneration characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. The K296E rhodopsin mutant mislocalized in photoreceptor cells and, surprisingly, appeared to aggregate, as indicated by the dye PROTEOSTAT, which binds protein aggregates. The propensity of the K296E rhodopsin mutant to aggregate was tested and confirmed in vitro but was dependent on the species background of rhodopsin. The K296E mutation on either murine or human rhodopsin backgrounds exhibited similar propensities to aggregate. The same mutation on a bovine rhodopsin background, however, exhibited a lower propensity to aggregate, indicating this species background does not adequately model the effects of the K296E mutation. In contrast to previous expectations, we demonstrate here that aggregation of the K296E rhodopsin mutant can promote photoreceptor cell loss.

">Vulnerability to memory decline in aging. A mega-analysis of structural brain change.</a></h4>

              
                Brain atrophy is a key factor behind episodic memory loss in aging, but the nature and ubiquity of this relationship remains poorly understood. This study leveraged 13 longitudinal datasets, including 3,737 cognitively healthy adults (10,343 MRI scans; 13,460 memory assessments), to determine whether brain change-memory change associations are more pronounced with age and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Both factors are associated with accelerated brain decline, yet it remains unclear whether memory loss is exacerbated beyond what atrophy alone would predict. Additionally, we assessed whether memory decline aligns with a global pattern of atrophy or stems from distinct regional contributions. Our mega-analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between memory decline and brain atrophy, primarily affecting individuals with above-average brain structural decline. The associations were stronger in the hippocampus but also spread across diverse cortical and subcortical regions. The associations strengthened with age, reaching moderate associations in participants in their eighties. While APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers exhibited steeper brain and memory loss, genetic risk had no effect on the change-change associations. These findings support the presence of common biological macrostructural substrates underlying memory function in older age which are vulnerable to multiple age-related factors, even in the absence of overt pathological changes.

">A therapeutic role for a regulatory glucose transporter1 (Glut1)-associated natural antisense transcript</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain relies primarily on glucose for its energy needs. Delivery of this nutrient to the brain is mediated by the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) protein. Low Glut1 thwarts glucose entry into the brain, causing an energy crisis and, triggering, in one instance, the debilitating neurodevelopmental condition, Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS). Current treatments for Glut1DS are sub-optimal, as none address the root cause, low Glut1, of the condition. Levels of this transporter must respond rapidly to the brain's changing energy requirements. This necessitates fine-tuning its expression. Here we describe a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense to Glut1 and show that it is involved in such regulation. Raising levels of the lncRNA had a concordant effect on Glut1 in cultured human cells and transgenic mice; reducing levels elicited the opposite effect. Delivering the lncRNA to Glut1DS model mice via viral vectors induced Glut1 expression, enhancing brain glucose levels to mitigate disease. Direct delivery of such a lncRNA to combat disease has not been reported previously and constitutes a unique therapeutic paradigm. Moreover, considering the importance of maintaining homeostatic Glut1 levels, calibrating transporter expression via the lncRNA could become broadly relevant to the myriad conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, wherein Glut1 concentrations are perturbed.

">A factor-based analysis of individual human microglia uncovers regulators of an Alzheimer-related transcriptional signature</a></h4>

              
                Human microglial heterogeneity is only beginning to be appreciated at the molecular level. Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.

">The development of visual acuity and crowding: Finding the balance between fine detail and 'gist' processing</a></h4>

              
                The adult visual system is characterised by high-resolution foveal vision and a peripheral field limited by crowding, the disruption to object recognition in clutter that gives a summary 'gist' in place of fine detail. In children, crowding is elevated in the fovea, with estimates of the age where foveal crowding drops to adult-like levels varying widely from 5 to 12+ years. As crowding restricts key processes like reading, better characterisation of this developmental trajectory is critical. We developed methods optimised to measure crowding in children, whereby adults and typically developing children aged 3-13 years (n=119) judged the orientation of a foveal 'VacMan' target either in isolation or surrounded by 'ghost' flankers. Stimulus sizes and separation were scaled adaptively. In the isolated condition, acuity (measured as gap-size thresholds) dropped rapidly to adult-like levels at 5-6 years. Thresholds rose when flankers were added, demonstrating foveal crowding at all ages. These elevations were highest at 3-4 years and persisted at 5-6 years, dropping to adult-like levels at 7-8 years. A meta-analysis of our thresholds and those from 11 prior studies reveals the same overall developmental trajectory, despite widely varying stimuli and procedures, with some divergent estimates likely driven by measurement confounds such as underestimated adult crowding levels. We further demonstrate that developmental foveal crowding shows the same selectivity for target-flanker similarity as peripheral crowding, consistent with common mechanisms. This prolonged development of crowding reveals a shifting balance in the visual system between the processing of fine detail vs. the 'gist' of the scene.

">Working memory readout varies with frontal theta rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that attention varies rhythmically, phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations. Here, we report that the phase of theta oscillations (3 to 6 Hz) in the frontal eye field (FEF) is associated with temporal and spatial variation of the read-out of information from working memory (WM). Non-human primates were briefly shown a sample array of colored squares. A short time later, they viewed a test array and were rewarded for identifying which square changed color (the target). Better performance (accuracy and reaction time) varied systematically with the phase of local field potential (LFP) theta at the time of test array onset as well as the target location. This is consistent with theta scanning across the FEF and thus visual space from top to bottom. Theta was coupled, on opposing phases, to both spiking and beta (12 to 20 Hz). These results could be explained by a wave of activity that moves across the FEF, modulating the readout of information from WM.

">On variability in local field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal coding and decoding would be compromised if neuronal responses were highly variable. Intriguingly, neuronal spike counts (SCs) show a reduction in across-trial variance (ATV) in response to sensory stimulation, when SC variance is normalized by SC mean, that is, when using the Fano factor 1. Inspired by this seminal finding, ATV has also been studied in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, revealing effects of various stimulus and cognitive factors as well as disease states. Here, we empirically show that outside of evoked potentials, the ATV of the EEG or local field potential (LFP) is very highly correlated to the intra-trial variance (ITV), which corresponds to the well-known power metric. We propose that the LFP power, rather than the raw LFP signal, should be considered with regard to putative changes of its variability. We quantify LFP power variability as the standard deviation of the logarithm of the power ratio between an active and a baseline condition, normalized by the mean of that log(power ratio), that is the coefficient of variation (CV) of the log(power ratio). This CV(log(power ratio)) is reduced for gamma and alpha power when they are enhanced by stimulation, and it is enhanced for alpha power when it is reduced by stimulation. This suggests a potential inverse relation between changes in band-limited power and the corresponding CV. We propose that the CV(log(power ratio)) is a useful metric that can be computed for numerous existing and future LFP, EEG or MEG datasets, which will provide insights into those signals' frequency-specific variability and how they might be used for neuronal coding and decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-341/v1?src=rss">Hybrid optimization technique for matrix chain multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computational mathematics and computer science, often encountered in scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning. Traditional MCM optimization techniques use Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization to determine the optimal parenthesization for minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. However, standard matrix multiplication still operates in O(n3) time complexity, leading to inefficiencies for large matrices. Methods In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization technique that integrates Strassen’s algorithm into MCM to further accelerate matrix multiplication. Our approach consists of two key phases: (i) matrix chain order optimization, using a top-down memoized DP approach, we compute the best multiplication sequence, and (ii) hybrid multiplication strategy, we selectively apply Strassen’s algorithm for large matrices (n ≥ 128), reducing the complexity from O(n3) to O(n2.81), while using standard multiplication for smaller matrices to avoid recursive overhead. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid method through computational experiments comparing execution time, memory usage, and numerical accuracy against traditional MCM and Strassen’s standalone multiplication. Results Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method achieves significant speedup (4x–8x improvement) and reduces memory consumption, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This research opens pathways for further optimizations in parallel computing and GPU-accelerated matrix operations. Conclusion This study presents a hybrid approach to Matrix Chain Multiplication by integrating Strassen’s algorithm, reducing execution time and memory usage. By selectively applying Strassen’s method for large matrices, the proposed technique improves efficiency while preserving accuracy. Future work can focus on parallel computing and GPU acceleration for further optimization.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother's or the child's health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being "too posh to push", inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh's CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

                Background Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people. Recent evidence has highlighted iron status as a key requirement for effective immune responses. Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women and vaccines are mandated at this stage of life. In the antenatal clinics (ANC) of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thailand-Myanmar border, all pregnant women receive nutritional iron supplements at prophylactic or treatment dosages, as determined by haematocrit. Migrant pregnant women have been offered vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus since 1997, and since April-2022 COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by vaccine history. In this setting, nearly 10% of pregnant women are anaemic at their first ANC visit; approximately 50% of anaemic women receiving treatment doses of nutritional supplements respond by increasing haematocrit after one month of supplementation. Methods This study aimed to investigate whether response to iron supplementation is associated with improved vaccine responses in pregnant women with anemia in this setting. We will monitor three groups of pregnant women vaccinated at their first ANC visit before 28 weeks of gestation receiving nutritional iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplements (Sangobion®, Procter&Gamble): 1) non-anaemic women who receive preventive doses of supplementation, 2) anaemic women who display a haematocrit response to treatment doses, and 3) anaemic women who do not respond to treatment doses. The primary endpoint is the difference in the geometric mean titer ratio (rGMT, comparing baseline to 28 days post-vaccination) of diphtheria-tetanus and COVID vaccine-specific antibodies between anaemic women who respond and those who fail to make a haematocrit response to iron-containing interventions. Discussion Iron deficiency in different populations is associated with poor vaccine efficacy, and nutritional iron supplementation may improve the immune response to vaccines. Interventions that significantly increase vaccine efficacy would represent a major benefit to public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-722/v4?src=rss">Legal aspects and government policy in increasing the role of MSMEs in the Halal ecosystem [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                <p>Stress is a common occurrence for military personnel. This can include the stress of deployment and active combat. Anxiety is considered a reaction to stress, and with anxiety-related disorders on the rise, it is imperative that stress be considered a preexisting condition when studying a number of neurological conditions. To determine the effects of stress on the behavioral outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we used a 3&nbsp;d acute unpredictable stress (AUS) model followed by blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) to assess social anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats. The animals were divided into four groups including unstressed and uninjured control (Con), stress-only animals (AUS), injury-only animals (BINT), and animals that received both stress and injury (AUS + BINT). In the males, behavioral tests such as elevated plus and three-chamber sociability (3-CS) showed that stress plays a dominant role in determining behavioral outcomes after TBI with the AUS + BINT animals behaving more similarly to the AUS animals than the BINT animals. Other tests, such as open field, showed that AUS + BINT had an additive effect on anxiety-like behavior or that prestress could even have a protective effect as seen in three-chamber social novelty (3-CSN). Behavioral assessment of female animals showed that AUS + BINT had the opposite effect than it did on the males in both three-chamber sociability and three-chamber social novelty, while the open field results were similar to the males. This study shows that neurological changes driven by stress have an effect on the behavioral outcomes of BINT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0033-24.2025?rss=1">Characteristics of Spontaneous Anterior-Posterior Oscillation-Frequency Convergences in the Alpha Band</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterior&ndash;posterior interactions in the alpha band (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) have been implicated in various functions including perception, attention, and working memory. The underlying neural communication can be flexibly controlled by adjusting phase relations when activities across anterior&ndash;posterior regions oscillate at a matched frequency. We thus investigated how alpha oscillation frequencies spontaneously converged along anterior&ndash;posterior regions by tracking oscillatory EEG activity while participants rested. As more anterior&ndash;posterior regions (scalp sites) frequency-converged, the probability of additional regions joining the frequency convergence increased, and so did oscillatory synchronization (i.e., oscillatory power) at participating regions, suggesting that anterior&ndash;posterior frequency convergences are driven by inter-regional entrainment. Notably, frequency convergences were accompanied by two types of approximately linear phase gradients, one progressively phase lagged in the anterior direction, the posterior-to-anterior (P-A) gradient, and the other progressively phase lagged in the posterior direction, the anterior-to-posterior (A-P) gradient. These gradients implied traveling waves propagating in the feedforward and feedback directions, respectively. Interestingly, while in natural viewing frequency convergences were accompanied by both gradient types (occurring at different frequencies) regardless of anterior&ndash;posterior routes, when the eyes were closed, the P-A and A-P gradients spatially segregated, channeling feedforward flows of information primarily through the midline and feedback flows primarily through each hemisphere. Future research may investigate how eye closure organizes information flows in this way and how it influences hierarchical information processing. Future research may also investigate the functional roles of frequency-convergence contingent traveling waves in contrast to those generated by other mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Delayed motor development is an early clinical sign of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, changes at the neural circuit level that underlie early motor differences are underexplored. The striatum, the principal input nucleus of the basal ganglia, plays an important role in motor learning in adult animals, and the maturation of the striatal circuit has been associated with the development of early motor behaviors. Here, we briefly exposed pregnant C57BL/6 dams to ethanol (5% w/w) in a liquid diet on embryonic days 13.5&ndash;16.5 and assessed the mouse progeny using a series of nine brief motor behavior tasks on postnatal days 2&ndash;14. Live brain slices were then obtained from behaviorally tested mice for whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp electrophysiology to assess GABAergic/glutamatergic synaptic activity and passive/active properties in two populations of striatal neurons: GABAergic interneurons and spiny striatal projection neurons. Electrophysiologically recorded spiny striatal projection neurons were also filled intracellularly with biocytin for post hoc analysis of dendritic morphology. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in developmental motor delays that were more severe in male mice and coincided with sex-dependent differences in the maturation of striatal neurons. Our findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure results in dynamic morphological and functional changes to the developmental trajectories of striatal neurons commensurate with the development of motor behaviors that differ between male and female mice.</p>

                <p>When attempting to concurrently perform two distinct cognitive tasks, the performance of either task is frequently compromised. This phenomenon is known as dual-task interference. Although multiple task features have been postulated to influence on dual-task interference, the primary determinant remains unclear. The determinant factor causing dual-task interference is an important issue to understand its mechanism and associated functions including switching tasks and planning task order. The present study investigated this issue using monkeys and three behavioral tasks requiring distinct cognitive processes (spatial working memory, SWM; working memory and long-term memory of objects, PA; object working memory, DMS) and manipulating task pair (SWM and PA or SWM and DMS), task order (fixed or randomized), and task difficulty (different delay lengths). The task introduced first showed better performance as compared with the task introduced second, suggesting the task order as an important factor. However, the performance of the SWM task decreased when preceded by the PA and DMS tasks, while the latter tasks were unaffected when the SWM task was introduced first. This tendency was more obvious in random-order conditions than fixed-order conditions. Further, interference effect increased as task difficulty increased. Although the task order is one determinant, our results show the difference in cognitive process needed for tasks, its complexity, and the demand of working memory resources as more significant determinants for deciding the dominant task in dual-task conditions, indicating importance of neural mechanisms including managing working memory resources and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to understand the cause of dual-task interference.</p>

                Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is an exceptionally rare malignancy, often misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to overlapping and non-specific clinical and radiological features. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasingly associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case of a 63-year-old male with chronic HCV infection and F2 hepatic fibrosis who presented with abdominal pain, pruritus, and weight loss. Radiological imaging revealed a pancreatic mass which was subsequently confirmed via histopathological examination to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the initiation of antiviral therapy, the patient succumbed before starting chemotherapy. This case underscores the potential association between HCV infection and PPL, highlighting the importance of early antiviral treatment to prevent severe extrahepatic complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-336/v1?src=rss">Evaluation of the effect of two conventional and one herbal mouthwash on the modulus of elasticity of three orthodontic wires: an in vitro study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background During fixed appliance therapy, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial; however, certain mouthwashes can negatively impact orthodontic treatment by altering the mechanical properties of archwires. The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires' Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

                Background Cognitive decline and dementia disproportionately affect Black/African populations in the United States, influenced by lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health disparities. This study examines the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NACC data on 24,476 Black/African adults. Key variables included age, sex, education, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and vascular health markers (hypertension, blood pressure). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum scores. Results The study population had a mean age of 74.5 years, with 74.1% being female. Education levels varied, with 46.84% completing high school and 18.74% attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher. The mean BMI was 29.46 kg/m2, indicating a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, and 77.1% had hypertension, yet only 8.02% were on antihypertensive medication. MMSE scores declined significantly with increasing age (β = -0.09, p < 0.001) and higher depression scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.001), while higher education levels were associated with better cognitive performance (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). Obesity showed a non-linear association, with midlife obesity linked to higher dementia risk but late-life low BMI correlated with frailty and cognitive impairment. Hypertension and elevated systolic blood pressure were weak but significantly associated with cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption (48.77%) and smoking (8%) had mixed effects, with heavy drinking negatively affecting cognition. Conclusion Modifiable risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, depression, and limited educational attainment, significantly influence cognitive outcomes in Black/African populations. Targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and culturally tailored lifestyle modifications could mitigate cognitive decline and dementia risk in this population.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                <p>by Carla M. Kumbale, Qiang Zhang, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants known for their multiple health effects, from skin rashes to liver dysfunction, reproductive toxicity and cancer. While the hazards of dioxins have been well documented, the challenge of developing a comprehensive understanding of the overall health impact of dioxins remains. We propose to address this challenge with a new approach methodology (NAM) consisting of a novel adaptation of the Template-and-Anchor (T&A) modeling paradigm. Generically, the template model is defined as a high-level coarse-grained model capturing the main physiological processes of the system. The variables of this template model are anchor models, which represent component sub-systems in greater detail at lower biological levels. For the case of dioxin, we design the template to capture the systemic effects of dioxin on the body’s handling of cholesterol. Two new anchor models within this template elucidate the effects of dioxin on cholesterol transport in the bloodstream and on sex hormone steroidogenesis and the menstrual cycle. A third anchor model, representing dioxin-mediated effects on cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, had been developed previously. The T&A modeling paradigm enables a holistic evaluation of the impact of toxicants, which in the future may be translated into a powerful tool for comprehensive computational health risk assessments, personalized medicine, and the development of virtual clinical trials.

Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to alterations of supra-valvular flow patterns which can cause increased damage of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. We investigated these patient specific patterns of a severe AS patient and their reversal in healthy flow through a 4D Flow MRI-based CFD methodology. Computational models of subject-specific aortic geometries were created using in-vivo medical imaging data. Temporally and spatially resolved boundary conditions derived from 4D Flow MRI were implemented for an AS patient and a healthy subject. After validation of the in-silico results with in-vivo data, a healthy inflow profile was set for the AS patient in the CFD model. Pathological versus healthy flow fields were compared regarding their blood flow characteristics, i.e., shear stresses on RBCs and helicity. The accuracy of the 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model was proven with excellent agreement between in-vivo and in-silico velocity fields and R² = 0.9. A pathological high shear stress region in the bulk flow was present during late systole with an increase of 125% compared to both healthy flow. The physiological bihelical structure with predominantly right-handed helices vanished for the pathological state. Instead, a left-handed helix appeared, accompanied by an overall increase in turbulent kinetic energy in areas of accumulated left-handed helicity. The validated 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model identified marked differences between AS and healthy flow. It suggests that altered turbulent and helical structures in the bulk flow are the cause for increased, potentially damaging forces acting upon RBCs in AS.

Soil organisms represent the most abundant and diverse organisms on the planet and support almost every ecosystem function we know, and thus impact our daily lives. Some of these impacts have been well-documented, such as the role of soil organisms in regulating soil fertility and carbon sequestration; processes that have direct implications for essential ecosystem services including food security and climate change mitigation. Moreover, soil biodiversity also plays a critical role in supporting other aspects from One Health—the combined health of humans, animals, and the environment—to the conservation of historic structures such as monuments. Unfortunately, soil biodiversity is also highly vulnerable to a growing number of stressors associated with global environmental change. Understanding how and when soil biodiversity supports these functions, and how it will adapt to changing environmental conditions, is crucial for conserving soils and maintaining soil processes for future generations. In this Essay, we discuss the fundamental importance of soil biodiversity for supporting multiple ecosystem services and One Health, and further highlight essential knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to conserve soil biodiversity for the next generations.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>The mismatch negativity response is brain activity following an unexpected auditory stimulus in humans. We used whole-brain calcium imaging to characterize auditory responses to unexpected sounds in larval zebrafish. Auditory neuron responses decrease after repetition of specific frequencies without generalization between frequencies, evidence of stimulus-specific adaptation. However, we did not find evidence for deviance responses to unexpected sounds within a sequence or to the unexpected omission of sounds from a sequence.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals receive a constant stream of sensory input, and detecting changes in this sensory landscape is critical to their survival. One signature of change detection in humans is the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response to unexpected stimuli that deviate from a predictable sequence. This process requires the auditory system to adapt to specific repeated stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel input (stimulus-specific adaptation [SSA]). MMN was originally described in humans, and equivalent responses have been found in other mammals and birds, but it is not known to what extent this deviance detection circuitry is evolutionarily conserved. Here we present the first evidence for SSA in the brain of a teleost fish, using whole-brain calcium imaging of larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution with selective plane illumination microscopy. We found frequency-specific responses across the brain with variable response amplitudes for frequencies of the same volume and created a loudness curve to model this effect. We presented an auditory “oddball” stimulus in an otherwise predictable train of pure tone stimuli and did not find a population of neurons with specific responses to deviant tones that were not otherwise explained by SSA. Further, we observed no deviance responses to an unexpected omission of a sound in a repetitive sequence of white noise bursts. These findings extend the known scope of auditory adaptation and deviance responses across the evolutionary tree and lay groundwork for future studies to describe the circuitry underlying auditory adaptation at the level of individual neurons.</p>

                The human brain is characterized by impressive cognitive abilities. The neocortex is the seat of higher cognition, and neocortex expansion is a hallmark of human evolution. While developmental programs are similar in different species, the timing of developmental transitions and the capacity of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to proliferate differ, contributing to the increased production of neurons during human cortical development. Here, we review the epigenetic regulation of developmental transitions during corticogenesis, focusing mostly on humans while building on knowledge from studies in mice. We discuss metabolic-epigenetic interplay as a potential mechanism to integrate extracellular signals into neural chromatin. Moreover, we synthesize current understanding of how epigenetic and metabolic deregulation can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we outline how developmental timing can be investigated using brain organoid models.

                Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs), comprising oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes, are pivotal in sculpting central nervous system (CNS) architecture and function. OPCs mature into oligodendrocytes, which enwrap axons with myelin sheaths that are critical for enhancing neural transmission. Notably, OLCs actively respond to neuronal activity, modulating neural circuit functions. Understanding neuron–OLC interactions is key to unraveling how OLCs contribute to CNS health and pathology. This review highlights insights from zebrafish and mouse models, revealing how synaptic and extrasynaptic pathways converge to shape spatiotemporal calcium (Ca2+) dynamics within OLCs. We explore how Ca2+ signal integration across spatial and temporal scales acts as a master regulator of OLC fate determination and myelin plasticity.

                Spontaneous pain, characterized by episodic shooting or stabbing sensations, is a significant complaint among neuropathic pain patients but remains poorly understood. Xie et al. provide evidence that triggers of spontaneous pain and clustered firings are dynamic movements of blood vessels in the sensory ganglion, detected by Piezo2 receptors in adjacent neurons.

They uncover a coordinated, gradual increase in chromatin accessibility, sequential transcription factor binding to promoters and enhancers, and dissect the complex interplay of the pluripotency regulators OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in this process.

                The interplay between bilirubin metabolism and antiviral immunity remains unknown. Du et al. found that hepatic bilirubin metabolism enhances antiviral innate immunity by both promoting IFN-I production via UGT1A1 and reducing serum bilirubin levels to attenuate bilirubin-mediated inhibition of IFN-I signaling.

                Bäumlin et al. investigate the roles of coronavirus Nsp1 in translation inhibition and mRNA degradation using a human cell-free translation system. They demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 mediates mRNA degradation independently of translation, whereas MERS-CoV Nsp1 inhibits translation without degradation, revealing distinct mechanisms and co-evolutionary protection of viral mRNAs.

Though traditionally studied in primates, Rhee et al. use high-throughput behavior and two-photon imaging in awake, head-fixed rats to characterize a neural pathway that may underlie visual object recognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100350">Deficiency in DNAH12 causes male infertility by impairing DNAH1 and DNALI1 recruitment in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Asthenoteratozoospermia, a prevalent cause of male infertility, lacks a well-defined etiology. DNAH12 is a special dynein featured by the absence of a microtubule-binding domain, however, its functions in spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. Through comprehensive genetic analyses involving whole-exome sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing on infertile patients and fertile controls from six distinct families, we unveiled six biallelic mutations in <i>DNAH12</i> that co-segregate recessively with male infertility in the studied families. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed pronounced axonemal abnormalities, including inner dynein arms (IDAs) impairment and central pair (CP) loss in sperm flagella of the patients. Mouse models (<i>Dnah12</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></i>) were generated and recapitulated the reproductive defects in the patients. Noteworthy, DNAH12 deficiency did not show effects on cilium organization and function. Mechanistically, DNAH12 was confirmed to interact with two other IDA components DNALI1 and DNAH1, while disruption of DNAH12 leads to failed recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 to IDAs and compromised sperm development. Furthermore, DNAH12 also interacts with radial spoke head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, and DNAJB13 to regulate CP stability. Moreover, the infertility of <i>Dnah12</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be overcome by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Collectively, DNAH12 plays a crucial role in the proper organization of axoneme in sperm flagella, but not cilia, by recruiting DNAH1 and DNALI1 in both humans and mice. These findings expand our comprehension of dynein component assembly in flagella and cilia and provide a valuable marker for genetic counseling and diagnosis of asthenoteratozoospermia in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99217">CDK-mediated phosphorylation of PNKP is required for end-processing of single-strand DNA gaps on Okazaki fragments and genome stability</a></h4>

              
                Polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) has enzymatic activities as 3′-phosphatase and 5′-kinase of DNA ends to promote DNA ligation and repair. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate the phosphorylation of threonine 118 (T118) in PNKP. This phosphorylation allows recruitment to the gapped DNA structure found in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) nicks and/or gaps between Okazaki fragments (OFs) during DNA replication. T118A (alanine)-substituted PNKP-expressing cells exhibited an accumulation of ssDNA gaps in S phase and accelerated replication fork progression. Furthermore, PNKP is involved in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent replication gap filling as part of a backup pathway in the absence of OFs ligation. Altogether, our data suggest that CDK-mediated PNKP phosphorylation at T118 is important for its recruitment to ssDNA gaps to proceed with OFs ligation and its backup repairs via the gap-filling pathway to maintain genome stability.
