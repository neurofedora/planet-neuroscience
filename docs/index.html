              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12615">GATE: Adaptive Learning with Working Memory by Information Gating in Multi-lamellar Hippocampal Formation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hippocampal formation (HF) can rapidly adapt to varied environments and build flexible working memory (WM). To mirror the HF's mechanism on generalization and WM, we propose a model named Generalization and Associative Temporary Encoding (GATE), which deploys a 3-D multi-lamellar dorsoventral (DV) architecture, and learns to build up internally representation from externally driven information layer-wisely. In each lamella, regions of HF: EC3-CA1-EC5-EC3 forms a re-entrant loop that discriminately maintains information by EC3 persistent activity, and selectively readouts the retained information by CA1 neurons. CA3 and EC5 further provides gating function that controls these processes. After learning complex WM tasks, GATE forms neuron representations that align with experimental records, including splitter, lap, evidence, trace, delay-active cells, as well as conventional place cells. Crucially, DV architecture in GATE also captures information, range from detailed to abstract, which enables a rapid generalization ability when cue, environment or task changes, with learned representations inherited. GATE promises a viable framework for understanding the HF's flexible memory mechanisms and for progressively developing brain-inspired intelligent systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12881">Reinforcement learning Based Automated Design of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Black-box Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is recognized as one of the most effective evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in black-box optimization due to its derivative-free nature. Numerous enhancements to the fundamental DE have been proposed, incorporating innovative mutation strategies and sophisticated parameter tuning techniques to improve performance. However, no single variant has proven universally superior across all problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design DE for black-box optimization through meta-learning. RL acts as an advanced meta-optimizer, generating a customized DE configuration that includes an optimal initialization strategy, update rule, and hyperparameters tailored to a specific black-box optimization problem. This process is informed by a detailed analysis of the problem characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize a double deep Q-network for implementation, considering a subset of 40 possible strategy combinations and parameter optimizations simultaneously. The framework's performance is evaluated against black-box optimization benchmarks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results highlight the promising potential of our proposed framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482">TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12598">On Accelerating Deep Neural Network Mutation Analysis by Neuron and Mutant Clustering</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutation analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a promising method for effective evaluation of test data quality and model robustness, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for large models. To alleviate this, we present DEEPMAACC, a technique and a tool that speeds up DNN mutation analysis through neuron and mutant clustering. DEEPMAACC implements two methods: (1) neuron clustering to reduce the number of generated mutants and (2) mutant clustering to reduce the number of mutants to be tested by selecting representative mutants for testing. Both use hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group neurons and mutants with similar weights, with the goal of improving efficiency while maintaining mutation score. DEEPMAACC has been evaluated on 8 DNN models across 4 popular classification datasets and two DNN architectures. When compared to exhaustive, or vanilla, mutation analysis, the results provide empirical evidence that neuron clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 69.77%, with an average -26.84% error in mutation score. Meanwhile, mutant clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 35.31%, with an average 1.96% error in mutation score. Our results demonstrate that a trade-off can be made between mutation testing speed and mutation score error.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12776">Data re-uploading in Quantum Machine Learning for time series: application to traffic forecasting</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.

                arXiv:2501.11477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses two meta-heuristics methodologies to introduce two novel quantum-inspired meta heuristic approaches: quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA1) and quantum-inspired genetic algorithm with dynamic approach (QIGA2). The two suggested methods combine a classical and quantum genetic algorithm approach. Both approaches use The correlation coefficient as an assessment function to identify the best (optimal) values for binary image. In quantum computing, they use simple ideas like qubits and state superposition. Due to these characteristics, parallelism which uses the time discreteness of quantum mechanical systems, is exhibited. For five distinct MNIST datasets, the performance of all participating algorithms has been assessed by comparing the suggested approaches first with their traditional approach counterparts and then with the proposed methods QIGA1 and QIGA2. Each method's ideal threshold value, associated fitness value (best and average), loss, and accuracy for each MNIST dataset have all been published. The outcomes demonstrate the superior efficiency of the suggested approaches over their traditional equivalents.

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.

Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00368">Design Optimizer for Soft Growing Robot Manipulators in Three-Dimensional Environments</a></h4>

Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.

	<p>Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition with a lifetime prevalence of 2&amp;amp;ndash;3%. It significantly burdens quality of life and is associated with substantial economic and disease burdens. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the first-line treatments for OCD. Approximately two-thirds of patients with Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Disorder (OCD) exhibit inadequate responses to current standard therapies, thus lacking adequate therapy, resulting in a loss of quality of life and huge economic burdens. Repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, safe, and well-tolerated intervention that modulates prefrontal cortical circuits involved in OCD. A previous systematic review explored the therapeutic effects of rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) area in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. It showed that the application of high-frequency and low-frequency (LF) rTMS to the dlPFC region yielded controversial post-treatment Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Scale) findings due to factors such as small sample sizes, short-term study durations, and variations in rTMS protocols. Objectives: Thus, we propose a theoretical protocol based on previous findings to assess better the effect of LF rTMS for treatment-resistant OCD patients. Methods: We will recruit patients with moderate to severe OCD and limited response to previous treatments from in- and outpatient clinics. We will use fMRI for precious localization of the right dlPFC and application of 1 Hz stimulation of in total 2000 pulses with three times 40 s inter-train intervals 5 days a week, in 6 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome will be the mean reduction in Y-BOCS at the end of this study. Conclusions: This study highlights rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential to reform OCD treatment, accentuate safety, accessibility, clinical integration, and future research foundations.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study examined the differences in brain volume and cortical thickness among individuals with normal cognition (NC) and those with NCDs, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The aim was to identify the brain parameters supporting clinical decision-making for NCDs. Method: A total of 116 participants were categorized into dementia, MCI, and NC groups, and their brain scans using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were processed and automatedly analyzed with FreeSurfer to obtain the absolute brain volume, volume normalized by intracranial volume (ICV), and cortical thickness. Patients with dementia exhibited a significantly smaller brain volume and cortical thickness than the MCI and NC groups. Results: The left amygdala/ICV ratio demonstrated excellent performance in diagnosing early NCDs, with a cutpoint of &amp;amp;le;0.089, providing 83.30% sensitivity, 84.20% specificity, and 83.82% accuracy. For MCI, a cutpoint of &amp;amp;le;0.099 for the left amygdala/ICV yielded 96.70% sensitivity, 83.30% specificity, and 88.46% accuracy. Conclusions: The findings suggested that reductions in brain volume and cortical thickness correlate with cognitive decline. Utilizing FreeSurfer and MRI data, particularly the left amygdala/ICV ratio, may serve as a valuable biomarker for the early identification of individuals at risk for developing NCDs.</p>

	<p>Background: Different lateral and postero-lateral cranial approaches to the petroclival region and to the mid-upper brain stem have been described so far, some of which require extensive osseous demolition and possible damage of neurovascular structures. Neuronavigational systems are now extensively available for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation to assist the surgeons in choosing the optimally invasive approach for each pathology. Herein, we describe a detailed navigation-augmented morphometric analysis to bring insight into the usefulness of an anterior petrosectomy (AP) to handle lesions in the petroclival region. Methods: Eight cadaveric, silicone injected heads were used. A total of 14 approaches (AP, n = 8; retrosigmoid, RS, n = 6) using a standard microsurgical dissection technique were performed. All specimens had preoperative CT and MRI scans, as well as a post-dissection CT. The neuronavigational system was used for distance measurements, craniotomy sizes and surgical corridor volumes, for each approach. Results: The distance from the skull surface to the petrous apex was significantly shorter in the AP approach when compared with the RS (46.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.9 mm versus 71.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 mm, respectively, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Although the craniotomy size was not different, the volume of the surgical corridor was significantly larger with the AP approach (21.31 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.91 cm3 vs. 13.39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 cm3). The AP approach increased the length of the basilar artery exposure from 6.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 mm (obtained with a standard subtemporal approach) to 22.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 mm (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The surgical corridor to the petroclival region achieved by virtue of an AP was significantly larger and featured shorter working distances, resulting in a higher degree of surgical freedom. Although significant individual anatomical variations of fundamental neurovascular and bony structures were found, these difficulties were overcome by careful pre- and intraoperative use of neuronavigation.</p>

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Background/Aim To examine the clinical correlation of p16 expression with Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and lymphatic invasion in OPSCC patients in terms of clinical status at presentation, subsequent progression, and survival. Methods Tissue blocks of biopsy-proven Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma were subjected to Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for evaluating the expression of p16, e-cadherin, vimentin and podoplanin. This expression pattern was correlated with the demographic details, treatment response and survival patterns. Results 60 patients were finally available for evaluation in this study. Prevalence of HPV infection in our study was found to be 11.7%. E-cadherin expression was found in all HPV-associated patients whereas vimentin was not expressed in any of these. 71.4% patients had low Podoplanin expression and 85.7% had low lymphatic vessel count. Among the HPV- associated patients, 85.8% had T3-T4 stage, 100% had N2-N3 disease and 95% had stage IV disease. It was also found that p16-positive patients had significantly higher 1-year Overall survival (OS) (80%, p=0.045), higher 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) (60%) and higher 1-year Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) (75%) when compared to p16-negative patients. Conclusion Prevalence of HPV infection was found to be similar to that of previous studies conducted in India. As previous literature suggests, the HPV-positive patients in our study presented with advanced nodal disease at presentation and thereby, an advanced overall stage. Further follow-up of these patients including their treatment details, determination of possible prognostic markers, and evaluation of their survival parameters can be done which can help in modifying the existing treatment modalities as HPV-associated OPSCC are known to have better prognosis according to literature.

                Background Nurses and healthcare professionals employed in correctional and forensic mental health settings encounter unique challenges in the care of their patients due to custodial and restrictive environments. Regions within the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have recently experienced exponential economic and healthcare infrastructure development. Mental health has been prioritized for development by recent legislation and practice that incorporate the development of specialist forensic psychiatry services that mediate the need for specialized nurses and allied healthcare staff. Traditionally, forensic care has been provided by general services. The need to progress specialist forensic services with a focus on multidisciplinary staff that seeks to develop safer communities, enhance care, and support the criminal justice system. Methods This review article aims to provide a foundation for the nuances of forensic staff through social constructionism. We adopted the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). The use of a scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content, and outcomes to position the reader to the theoretical construct that society can be seen as existing in both objective and subjective reality. Discussion This paper argues for the preparedness of thought understood through social constructionism and demonstrates that it is envisaged that any frequently repeated action becomes cast into a pattern that can be reproduced without much effort. The interconnectedness between the themes of addiction, deviance, and crime allows for a holistic overview and improved understanding for care providers and this was achieved through bio-psychosocial model. Conclusion Through the emergence of these complex forms of knowledge, deviance within the lives of patients can be better understood by the emerging professions employed in the emerging forensic healthcare services within the Middle East. These individuals are carefully and dutifully navigating the cultural complexities of mental illness, addictions, and associated deviant behavior.

                Background The human ear is unique to individuals, and ear prints, like fingerprints, are discrete enough to distinguish identical twins. Therefore, the external ear could be used to identify both living and deceased individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the stature and sexual dimorphism of the external ear using various morphometric parameters and morphological features for forensic identification. Methods This study included 40 participants (20 males and 20 females). Participants were between the age of 18-25yrs. Measurements were taken with the subject’s head in the Frankfort horizontal plane. 18 measurements were taken like ear length and width, lobule height and width, concha length and width, tragus length, morphological ear length, helical mastoid distal length, thickness of ear lobe, auricular inclination angle, antihelical take off angle, concha mastoid angle, auricular index, lobular index, concha index, ear attachment length index and conchal bowl depth on external ear were taken and the morphological features like shape of ear, ear lobe, darwin’s tubercle and ear tragus, attachment of ear lobe and form of helix of both the right and left ears were noted. A digital Vernier caliper was used to measure all parameters. The angles were measured using a goniometer. Normal distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed parameters, an independent t-test was used, and for non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sexes. To compare the right and left parameters, independent t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed data) were applied. Sex determination and stature estimation were performed using logistic regression analysis. Results In males and females, the most common shape was oval, and the ear lobe was free. The most common shape of the ear lobe in males was arched, while in females, it was triangular. In males and females, the most common form of the helix was the concave marginal. In males, the most common shape of the tragus was round, whereas in females, it was long. In males and females, the most common shape of Darwin’s tubercle was enlarged. It was seen that the right lobe width showed perfect separation, indicating its potential as an extremely reliable predictor. It was noted that in females, the strongest correlation with height was with the ear inclination angle on both sides. Conclusion The results of this study can help forensic anthropologists identify the sex and stature of a person from various ear measurements.

                Memory consolidation requires rapid energy supply to neurons.

This mechanism coordinates just-in-time glial energy delivery in response to dynamic neuronal needs.

                Chemotherapy treatment can significantly increase the survival of patients with cancer, but it also causes collateral damage in the body that can lead to treatment dose reductions and can reduce patient quality of life. One understudied side effect of chemotherapy is circadian disruption, which is associated with lasting biological and behavioral toxicities. Mechanisms of how chemotherapy alters circadian rhythms remain largely unknown, although leveraging rodent models may provide insights into causes and consequences of this disruption. Here, we review physiological, molecular, and behavioral evidence of central and peripheral circadian disruption in various rodent models of chemotherapy and discuss possible mechanisms driving these circadian disruptions. Overall, restoring circadian rhythms following treatment-induced disruptions may be a novel target by which to improve the health and quality of life of survivors.

                The precise organization of the complex set of synaptic proteins at the nanometer scale is crucial for synaptic transmission. At the heart of this nanoscale architecture lies the nanocolumn. This aligns presynaptic neurotransmitter release with a high local density of postsynaptic receptor channels, thereby optimizing synaptic strength. Although synapses exhibit diverse protein compositions and nanoscale organizations, the role of structural diversity in the notable differences observed in synaptic physiology remains poorly understood. In this review we examine the current literature on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of nanocolumns, as well as their role in modulating various aspects of synaptic transmission. We also discuss how the reorganization of nanocolumns contributes to functional dynamics in both synaptic plasticity and pathology.

                The evolution of vertebrates from protochordate ancestors marked the beginning of the gradual transition to predatory lifestyles. Enabled by the acquisition of multipotent neural crest and cranial placode cell populations, vertebrates developed an elaborate peripheral nervous system, equipped with paired sense organs, which aided in adaptive behaviors and ultimately, successful colonization of diverse environmental niches. Underpinning the enduring success of vertebrates is the highly adaptable nature of the peripheral nervous system, which is enabled by the exceptional malleability of the neural crest and placode developmental programs. Here, we explore the embryonic origins of the vertebrate senses from the neural crest and cranial placodes and discuss the evolutionary trajectory of the senses in the context of adaptation to novel environments.

                In this issue of Neuron, Ruggiero et al. demonstrate that hippocampal networks maintain a stable mean firing rate despite unstable individual units. This homeostatic control operates through NMDAR-eEF2K-BDNF signaling in parvalbumin interneurons. Their findings highlight a mechanism by which cellular machinery maintains emergent network properties, bridging molecular mechanisms with network-level computation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88652">Multi-study fMRI outlooks on subcortical BOLD responses in the stop-signal paradigm</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the functional network underlying response inhibition in the human brain, particularly the role of the basal ganglia in successful action cancellation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approaches have frequently used the stop-signal task to examine this network. We merge five such datasets, using a novel aggregatory method allowing the unification of raw fMRI data across sites. This meta-analysis, along with other recent aggregatory fMRI studies, does not find evidence for the innervation of the <i>hyperdirect</i> or <i>indirect</i> cortico-basal-ganglia pathways in successful response inhibition. What we do find, is large subcortical activity profiles for <i>failed stop</i> trials. We discuss possible explanations for the mismatch of findings between the fMRI results presented here and results from other research modalities that have implicated nodes of the basal ganglia in successful inhibition. We also highlight the substantial effect smoothing can have on the conclusions drawn from task-specific general linear models. First and foremost, this study presents a proof of concept for meta-analytical methods that enable the merging of extensive, unprocessed, or unreduced datasets. It demonstrates the significant potential that open-access data sharing can offer to the research community. With an increasing number of datasets being shared publicly, researchers will have the ability to conduct meta-analyses on more than just summary data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94902">A double dissociation between semantic and spatial cognition in visual to default network pathways</a></h4>

              
                Processing pathways between sensory and default mode network (DMN) regions support recognition, navigation, and memory but their organisation is not well understood. We show that functional subdivisions of visual cortex and DMN sit at opposing ends of parallel streams of information processing that support visually mediated semantic and spatial cognition, providing convergent evidence from univariate and multivariate task responses, intrinsic functional and structural connectivity. Participants learned virtual environments consisting of buildings populated with objects, drawn from either a single semantic category or multiple categories. Later, they made semantic and spatial context decisions about these objects and buildings during functional magnetic resonance imaging. A lateral ventral occipital to fronto-temporal DMN pathway was primarily engaged by semantic judgements, while a medial visual to medial temporal DMN pathway supported spatial context judgements. These pathways had distinctive locations in functional connectivity space: the semantic pathway was both further from unimodal systems and more balanced between visual and auditory-motor regions compared with the spatial pathway. When semantic and spatial context information could be integrated (in buildings containing objects from a single category), regions at the intersection of these pathways responded, suggesting that parallel processing streams interact at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy to produce coherent memory-guided cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91716">Deficiency of orexin receptor type 1 in dopaminergic neurons increases novelty-induced locomotion and exploration</a></h4>

              
                Orexin signaling in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra promotes locomotion and reward processing, but it is not clear whether dopaminergic neurons directly mediate these effects. We show that dopaminergic neurons in these areas mainly express orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R). In contrast, only a minor population in the medial ventral tegmental area express orexin receptor subtype 2 (Ox2R). To analyze the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons, we deleted Ox1R specifically in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons of mice and investigated the functional consequences. Deletion of Ox1R increased locomotor activity and exploration during exposure to novel environments or when intracerebroventricularely injected with orexin A. Spontaneous activity in home cages, anxiety, reward processing, and energy metabolism did not change. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affected distinct neural circuits depending on the stimulation mode. In line with an increase of neural activity in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic projections innervate the LPGi in regions where the inhibitory dopamine receptor subtype D2 but not the excitatory D1 subtype resides. These data suggest a crucial regulatory role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90841">Multisensory integration operates on correlated input from unimodal transient channels</a></h4>

              
                Audiovisual information reaches the brain via both sustained and transient input channels, representing signals’ intensity over time or changes thereof, respectively. To date, it is unclear to what extent transient and sustained input channels contribute to the combined percept obtained through multisensory integration. Based on the results of two novel psychophysical experiments, here we demonstrate the importance of the transient (instead of the sustained) channel for the integration of audiovisual signals. To account for the present results, we developed a biologically inspired, general-purpose model for multisensory integration, the multisensory correlation detectors, which combines correlated input from unimodal transient channels. Besides accounting for the results of our psychophysical experiments, this model could quantitatively replicate several recent findings in multisensory research, as tested against a large collection of published datasets. In particular, the model could simultaneously account for the perceived timing of audiovisual events, multisensory facilitation in detection tasks, causality judgments, and optimal integration. This study demonstrates that several phenomena in multisensory research that were previously considered unrelated, all stem from the integration of correlated input from unimodal transient channels.

">Demonstrating the need for long inter-stimulus intervals when studying the post-movement beta rebound following a simple button press</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movements reliably elicit event-related synchronization of oscillatory neuronal rhythms in the beta (15-30 Hz) range immediately following movement offset, as measured by magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG). This response has been termed the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). While early work on the PMBR advocated for long inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) - arguing that the PMBR might persist for several seconds - these concerns have since fallen by the wayside, with many recent studies employing very short (< 5 s) ISIs. In this work we interrogated sensor-level MEG time courses in 635 individuals who participated in a cued button-pressing paradigm as part of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project. We focussed on a subset of trials in which button presses were separated by at least 15 seconds and, using curve modelling and Bayesian inference, estimated the point at which beta power returned to baseline levels. We show that beta power takes around 4-5 seconds to return to baseline levels following movement. These results have important implications for experimental design. The PMBR is ubiquitously defined relative to a preceding baseline period; we argue that short ISIs preclude true baseline estimation and, in turn, accurate estimation of PMBR magnitude. We recommend that future studies targeting the PMBR use ISIs of at least 7-5 seconds for beta power to return to baseline, plus a 1-2 second period for proper baseline estimation. Further work is needed to clarify PMBR duration in the context of different sensorimotor paradigms and clinical populations.

">Large Animal Epilepsy Model Platform: Kainic Acid Porcine Model of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Translational animal models are essential for advancing neuromodulation therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy. Large animal epilepsy models that accommodate implantable neuromodulation devices designed for humans are needed to advance electrical brain stimulation and sensing applicaitons. We establish a kainic acid (KA) porcine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) for pre-clinical research and development of novel stimulating therapies. Methods: We developed a platform integrating MRI-guided stereotactic electrode and chemotoxin delivery with intraoperative and long-term electrophysiology monitoring. Six domestic pigs underwent MRI-guided stereotactic implantation of bilateral hippocampal (HPC) and anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) electrodes, followed by KA infusion into the right HPC. Local field potential (LFP) monitoring was conducted intraoperatively with a bedside workstation and chronically with an implantable neural sensing and recording (INSR) device designed for human use. Cresyl violet staining, commonly used to visualize neurons, was used to assess the neuropathophysiological effect of the KA infusion. Results: KA infusion led to the emergence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), acute status epilepticus (SE), and spontaneous seizure activity. Acute IEDs and electrographic SE was observed in all cases, with two pigs euthanized due to uncontrolled seizures. Of the surviving four pigs, spontaneous IEDs were detected in all, and spontaneous seizures within 2 weeks were observed in three. Seizures in freely behaving animals varied from subclinical events to focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Single pulse evoked response potentials (SPEP) measured in two pigs demonstrated functional connectivity between ANT and HPC circuits. Neuronal disorganization and loss, both major components of mTLE neuropathology were observed. Significance: The KA-induced porcine mTLE model supports the feasibility of testing human neuromodulation devices and provides a translational platform for studying therapeutic electrical sensing and stimulation. In particular, the model should be useful for advancing automated seizure diaries, closed-loop and adaptive therapies targeting Papez circuit nodes.

">Sensorimotor adaptation reveals systematic biases in 3D perception.</a></h4>

              
                The existence of biases in visual perception and their impact on visually guided actions has long been a fundamental yet unresolved question. Evidence revealing perceptual or visuomotor biases has typically been disregarded because such biases in spatial judgments can often be attributed to experimental measurement confounds. To resolve this controversy, we leveraged the visuomotor system's adaptation mechanism - triggered only by a discrepancy between visual estimates and sensory feedback - to directly indicate whether systematic errors in perceptual and visuomotor spatial judgments exist. To resolve this controversy, we leveraged the adaptive mechanisms of the visuomotor system to directly reveal whether systematic biases or errors in perceptual and visuomotor spatial judgments exist. In a within-subject study (N=24), participants grasped a virtual 3D object with varying numbers of depth cues (single vs. multiple) while receiving haptic feedback. The resulting visuomotor adaptations and aftereffects demonstrated that the planned grip size, determined by the visually perceived depth of the object, was consistently overestimated. This overestimation intensified when multiple cues were present, despite no actual change in physical depth. These findings conclusively confirm the presence of inherent biases in visual estimates for both perception and action, and highlight the potential use of visuomotor adaptation as a novel tool for understanding perceptual biases.

">Mef2c Controls Postnatal Callosal Axon Targeting by Regulating Sensitivity to Ephrin Repulsion</a></h4>

              
                Cortical connectivity is contingent on ordered emergence of neuron subtypes followed by the formation of subtype-specific axon projections. Intracortical circuits, including long-range callosal projections, are crucial for information processing, but mechanisms of intracortical axon targeting are still unclear. We find that the transcription factor Myocyte enhancer factor 2-c (Mef2c) directs the development of somatosensory cortical (S1) layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons during embryogenesis. During early postnatal development, Mef2c expression shifts to layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons (L2/3 CPNs), and we find a novel function for Mef2c in targeting homotopic contralateral cortical regions by S1-L2/3 CPNs. We demonstrate, using functional manipulation of EphA-EphrinA signaling in Mef2c-mutant CPNs, that Mef2c downregulates EphA6 to desensitize S1-L2/3 CPN axons to EphrinA5-repulsion at their contralateral targets. Our work uncovers dual roles for Mef2c in cortical development: regulation of laminar subtype specification during embryogenesis, and axon targeting in postnatal callosal neurons.

                Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a significant treatment complication that affects a substantial proportion of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. Our understanding of the neural basis of LID remains limited, partly due to the small sample sizes in existing neuroimaging studies. In this study, we utilized structural MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including de novo PD patients (104 non-dyskinetic for a least 3 years after diagnosis and 120 who developed dyskinesia) and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Additionally, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI data from a subset of these participants to investigate connectivity differences among the groups. Our analysis revealed no significant baseline volumetric differences between dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic PD patients. However, the thickness of frontal and sensorimotor cortices was significantly greater in dyskinetic patients. In the subcortical regions, vertex-based shape analysis identified localized surface growth in the left caudate and left pallidum, as well as surface morphology changes in the bilateral pallidum in dyskinetics. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger connectivity between the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, and sensory cortex in dyskinetic PD patients compared to non-dyskinetics. These findings suggest that specific morphological and functional changes in the motor cortical-basal ganglia circuitry of de novo PD patients may predispose them to LID over time. Additionally, the altered functional connectivity patterns reinstate the role of the inferior frontal gyrus in the pathophysiology of dyskinesia and suggest that it might be a suitable target for neuromodulatory interventions, consistent with previous reports. Keywords: Voxel-based morphometry, shape analysis, functional connectivity, Parkinsons disease, PPMI, Levodopa-induced dyskinesia.

                Meta-analyses are invaluable tools for navigating the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Given their high value, ensuring the quality of meta-analyses is paramount. We conducted a multifaceted overview, examining each step in a manual neuroimaging meta-analysis on a large scale. We used four novel datasets comprising over 14,000 papers, including fMRI meta-analyses, fMRI studies, studies included in meta-analyses, and studies associated with image data on NeuroVault. Regarding successes, two-thirds of meta-analyses stated that they followed PRISMA guidelines, and 65% included a flowchart describing their inclusion process. We point out several areas for improvement. Pre-registration was fairly rare (20%), and only half listed their exact search strategy. There could be a location bias in which papers are included, and many did not include enough studies to be robust against publication bias (68% of meta analyses have less than 30 studies included). We also offer ideas for future directions. As image based meta-analysis is the gold standard, we have indicated which topics have the most image data available. The potential redundancy of topics can be visualized in our paper, and we recommend future meta-analyses be in conversation with past ones by citing and discussing previous similar work. By addressing these findings, the neuroimaging community can collectively improve the field of neuroimaging meta-analyses.

">Characterising ongoing brain aging from cross-sectional data</a></h4>

              
                "Brain age delta" is the difference between age estimated from brain imaging data and actual age. Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individual's positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a "historical baseline effect" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.

">Proximity labeling of the Tau repeat domain enriches RNA-binding proteins that are altered in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, tau dissociates from microtubules and forms toxic aggregates that contribute to neurodegeneration. Although some of the pathological interactions of tau have been identified from postmortem brain tissue, these studies are limited by their inability to capture transient interactions. To investigate the interactome of aggregate-prone fragments of tau, we applied an in vitro proximity labeling technique using split TurboID biotin ligase (sTurbo) fused with the tau microtubule repeat domain (TauRD), a core region implicated in tau aggregation. We characterized sTurbo TauRD co-expression, robust enzyme activity and nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in a human cell line. Following enrichment of biotinylated proteins and mass spectrometry, we identified over 700 TauRD interactors. Gene ontology analysis of enriched TauRD interactors highlighted processes often dysregulated in tauopathies, including spliceosome complexes, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and nuclear speckles. The disease relevance of these interactors was supported by integrating recombinant TauRD interactome data with human AD tau interactome datasets and protein co-expression networks from individuals with AD and related tauopathies. This revealed an overlap with the TauRD interactome and several modules enriched with RBPs and increased in AD and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). These findings emphasize the importance of nuclear pathways in tau pathology, such as RNA splicing and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and establish the sTurbo TauRD system as a valuable tool for exploring the tau interactome.

">Automatic detection of fluorescently labeled synapses in volumetric in vivo imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are submicron structures that connect and enable communication between neurons. Many forms of learning are thought to be encoded by synaptic plasticity, wherein the strength of specific synapses is regulated by modulating expression of neurotransmitter receptors. For instance, regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors is a central mechanism controlling the formation and recollection of long-term memories. A critical step in understanding how synaptic plasticity drives behavior is thus to directly observe, i.e., image, fluorescently labeled synapses in living tissue. However, due to their small size and incredible density - with one ~ 0.5 um diameter synapse every cubic micron - accurately detecting individual synapses and segmenting each from its closely abutting neighbors is challenging. To overcome this, we trained a convolutional neural network to simultaneously detect and separate densely labeled synapses. These tools significantly increased the accuracy and scale of synapse detection, enabling segmentation of hundreds of thousands of individual synapses imaged in living mice.

">Identifying mood instability and circadian rest-activity patterns using digital remote monitoring and actigraphy in participants at risk for bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Mood instability and circadian rhythm disruptions are both of increasing interest with regard to a number of psychiatric disorders, notably bipolar disorder (BD), but understanding of their nature and their interrelationship are incomplete. By definition, both have an integral temporal component and, as such, measuring them longitudinally and remotely is desirable. We conducted the Cognition and Mood Evolution across Time (COMET) study to assess the feasibility and value of digital devices to capture mood, its instability, and daily rest-activity patterns, over a 10-week period, in two groups of participants. The first group (n=37) were selected as scoring >7 on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) (high MDQ), thereby having a history of mood elevation and being at risk for BD. They were compared with a group (n=37) scoring <5 on the MDQ (low MDQ). Over a 10-week period, using a tablet, mood was rated daily, clinical ratings of depression, mania, and anxiety were captured weekly via the True Colours app, and a GENEactiv actigraph was worn to capture rest-activity pattern data. The main findings are that (1) MDQ score predicts mood instability; (2) high MDQ score is associated with more negative affect and mood symptoms than people with low MDQ, and with a different circadian activity profile; and (3) mood instability and circadian indices appear uncorrelated. The implications are that (1) remote monitoring of these domains is feasible and valuable; (2) selection of participants based on MDQ score is useful for studying mood (in)stability; and (3) the approach has potential for studies of clinical populations and for experimental medicine studies assessing interventions to reduce mood instability.

">Anxiety-associated behaviors following ablation of Miro1 from cortical excitatory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are neuropsychiatric disorders that manifest early in life with a wide range of phenotypes, including repetitive behavior, agitation, and anxiety (American Psychological Association, 2013). While the etiology of these disorders is not completely understood, recent data implicate a role for mitochondrial dysfunction. To function optimally mitochondria must translocate to metabolically active intracellular compartments to support energetics and free-radical buffering; failure to achieve this localization results in cellular dysfunction (Picard et al., 2016). Mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (Miro1) resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane and participates in neuronal microtubule-mediated mitochondrial motility and homeostasis (Fransson et al., 2003). Previous research implicates the loss of MIRO1 as a contributor to the onset/progression of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (Kay et al., 2018). We have hypothesized that MIRO1 also has a role in nervous system development and function (Lin-Hendel et al., 2016). To test this, we ablated Miro1 from cortical excitatory progenitors by crossing floxed Miro1 mice with Emx1-cre mice. We found that mitochondrial mis-localization in migrating excitatory neurons was associated with reduced brain weight, decreased cortical volume, and subtle disruptions in cortical organization. Adult Miro1 conditional mutants exhibit agitative-like behaviors, including decreased nesting behavior and abnormal home cage activity. Open field testing revealed anxiety-like behavior and elevated plus maze and wide/narrow box testing found the mice avoided confined spaces. Our data link MIRO1 function with mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders and implicate mitochondrial localization in anxiety-like behaviors.

">Fos expression in the periaqueductal gray, but not the ventromedial hypothalamus, is correlated with psychosocial stress-induced cocaine-seeking behavior in rats</a></h4>

              
                Psychosocial stressors are known to promote cocaine craving and relapse in humans but are infrequently employed in preclinical relapse models. Consequently, the underlying neural circuitry by which these stressors drive cocaine seeking has not been thoroughly explored. Using Fos expression analyses, we sought to examine whether the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) or periaqueductal gray (PAG), two critical components of the brain's hypothalamic defense system, are activated during psychosocial stress-induced cocaine seeking. Adult male and female rats self-administered cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/inf IV, fixed-ratio 1 schedule, 2 h/session) over 20 sessions. On sessions 11, 14, 17, and 20, a tactile cue was present in the operant chamber that signaled impending social defeat stress (n=16, 8/sex), footshock stress (n=12, 6/sex), or a no-stress control condition (n=12, 6/sex) immediately after the session's conclusion. Responding was subsequently extinguished, and rats were tested for reinstatement of cocaine seeking during re-exposure to the tactile cue that signaled their impending stress/no-stress post-session event. All experimental groups displayed significant reinstatement of cocaine seeking, but Fos analyses indicated that neural activity within the rostrolateral PAG (rPAGl) was selectively correlated with cocaine-seeking magnitude in the socially-defeated rats. rPAGl activation was also associated with active-defense coping behaviors during social defeat encounters and with Fos expression in prelimbic prefrontal cortex and orexin-negative cells of the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area in males, but not females. These findings suggest a potentially novel role for the rPAGl in psychosocial stress-induced cocaine seeking, perhaps in a sex-dependent manner.

">Scg2 drives reorganization of the corticospinal circuit with spinal premotor interneurons to recover motor function after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Brain injuries such as stroke damage neural circuitry and lead to functional deficits. Spared motor pathways are often reorganized and contribute to functional recovery; however, the connectivity and molecular mechanisms that drive the reorganization are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate structural and functional connectivity reformed by spared corticospinal axons after stroke and determine a key secretory protein that drives the reorganization. We first found that corticospinal axons innervate specific areas of the denervated cervical cord after stroke. Anatomical and photometric analyses reveal that the axons reconnect to premotor V2a interneurons. Kinematic analyses of forelimb movements and chemogenetic silencing reveal their contribution to motor recovery. Translated mRNA expression analyses of V2a interneurons and astrocytes in the denervated cervical cord reveal diverse transcripts upregulated in the rewiring process. In particular, a secretory protein Scg2 is upregulated by injury-induced purinergic ATP signals and rehabilitative training-induced neural activity and possesses an ability to promote axon growth via cAMP and S6 signaling. Scg2 overexpression in the denervated cervical cord enhances axon rewiring, while the Scg2 knockdown attenuates it. The present data reveal the neural substrate and molecular mechanism essential to induce reorganization and recovery of the motor system, providing fundamental therapeutic targets for CNS injuries.

">Cisternostomy facilitates clearance of metabolic waste from cerebrospinal fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Decompressive craniotomy, a common intervention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), can fail to effectively alleviate patient symptoms. Cisternostomy, reported for cistern drainage in TBI patients, has shown efficacy in reducing intracranial pressure and clearing detritus resulting from brain hemorrhage. However, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain largely unknown. Here, we utilized non-targeted metabolomics to analyze cerebrospinal fluid from cisterns alongside peripheral blood samples from TBI patients undergoing cisternostomy. Through a systematic comparison of the cisternal cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma metabolomes, we identified multiple blood-enriched metabolites, including betaine, triethanolamine, and proline, that were efficiently cleared during the acute stage of TBI. Notably, two metabolites linked to arginine metabolism and the urea cycle, N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetylputrescine, showed significant reductions that correlated with improvements in the Glasgow Coma Scale. Our findings indicate that cisternostomy effectively removes blood-derived substances and aids the recovery of patients with acute-stage TBI.

">Reduced levels of synaptic vesicle protein 2A in the extracellular vesicles and brain of Alzheimer's disease- associations with Aβ, tau and synaptophysin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synaptic dysfunction plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is an emerging imaging and fluid biomarker. Here, we aimed to assess the regional expression of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in the brain and extracellular vesicles of AD patients and its associations with the APOE e4 allele, amyloid-&#61538, tau pathologies, and other synaptic markers. Methods: Mass spectrometry-based synaptosome proteomics was performed on brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BdEVs) isolated from the frontal cortex of 17 AD patients and 4 NCs. Immunohistochemical staining for SV2A, synaptophysin, amyloid-{beta} and phospho-tau was performed on postmortem tissue from the frontal, temporal, and entorhinal cortices and hippocampus of 40 AD patients and 44 nondemented controls (NCs). Results: Reduced levels of synaptic proteins, including synaptotagamin, GAP43, SYT1, SNAP25 and 14-3-3zeta, were positively correlated with SV2A and negatively correlated with GFAP and NEFL in BdEVs from AD patients and NCs. We detected lower levels of SV2A in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of AD compard to NCs, and in APOE e4 carriers than in noncarriers. SV2A levels were positively correlated with synaptophysin and negatively correlated with the levels of the amyloid-{beta}, phospho-tau, and Braak stages. Conclusions: This study provides postmortem evidence of synaptic markers and reduced regional levels of SV2A in brain tissue slices and BdEVs from AD patients compared with NCs and in APOE e4 carriers compared to non-carriers. SV2A could serve as a valuable marker for monitoring synaptic degeneration in AD.

">Cannabinoid Modulation of Central Amygdala Population Dynamics During Threat Investigation</a></h4>

              
                Cannabinoids modulate innate avoidance, threat-reactivity, and stress adaptations via modulation amygdala-associated circuits; however, the mechanisms by which cannabinoids modulate amygdala representation of threat-related behavior are not known. We show that cannabinoid administration increases the activity of central amygdala (CeA) somatostatin neurons (SOM) and alters basal network dynamics in a manner supporting generation of antagonistic sub-ensembles within the SOM population. Moreover, diverging neuronal population trajectory dynamics and enhanced antagonistic sub-ensemble representation of threat-related behaviors, and enhanced threat-related location representation, were also observed. Lastly, cannabinoid administration increased the proportion of SOM neurons exhibiting multidimensional representation of threat-related behaviors and behavior-location conjunction. While cannabinoid receptor activation ex vivo suppressed excitatory inputs to SOM neurons, our data suggest preferential suppression of local GABA release subserves cannabinoid activation of CeA SOM neurons. These data provide insight into how cannabinoid-mediated presynaptic suppression transforms postsynaptic population dynamics and reveal cellular mechanisms by which cannabinoids could affect threat-reactivity.

">Influence of neural network bursts on functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Network bursts or synchronized burst events are a typical activity seen in most in vitro neural networks. Network bursts arise early in development and as networks mature, activity becomes dominated by bursts propagating across the entirety of the network. The reason for this developmental plateau in vitro is unknown, but to bypass it would confer a significant advantage in the use of in vitro networks for computation. As most neurons in a network participate in network bursts, burst onset supersedes any ongoing activity thereby placing a limit on short term computations equal to the recovery period between bursts. By assessing 521 multielectrode array recordings from day 4-39 in vitro we find that network bursts influence the connectivity, but this change is only weakly associated with the origin of the network bursts. The impacts of bursts on functional integration and segregation in neural networks are discussed along with approaches to mitigate the development and propagation of network bursts in vitro. Additionally, we hypothesize that burst initiation zones or pacemakers are viable targets for stimulation for computation in the context of control and reservoir computing.

">Sparks fade with distance: The effect of electric field distribution on global motion perception using different tES techniques</a></h4>

              
                Previous evidence has shown that high frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS) decreases motion coherence thresholds when a cephalic montage (i.e., return over Cz) is used. Extracephalic montages have also been employed to modulate behavioral performance, eliminating stimulation of regions under the return electrode. In this study, we examined the effects of different transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) protocols on visual motion discrimination, placing the return electrode on the ipsilateral arm. We assessed the impact of electrode localization using hf-tRNS, anodal, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and Sham stimulation over hMT+, a brain region involved in global motion perception. Motion direction discrimination was measured using random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Due to the increased distance between the stimulation and return electrodes in this montage, we expected a smaller reduction in motion discrimination thresholds compared to our previous study. The results suggest that increased interelectrode distance mitigates the efficacy of hf-tRNS. Additionally, no significant effects were observed with the other tES protocols tested. Our findings imply that the positioning of the two electrodes affects current flow characteristics, leading to reduced neuromodulation. These results underscore the importance of stimulation configuration, particularly the effect of interelectrode distance on performance. Given the widespread application of brain stimulation techniques in clinical and cognitive research, our results can guide future studies in carefully considering this further aspect of stimulation montage configurations.

">Parameterization of intraoperative human microelectroderecordings: Linking action potential morphology to brainanatomy</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a targeted manipulation of brain circuitry to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Optimal DBS lead placement is essential for treatment efficacy. Current targeting practice is based on preoperative and intraoperative brain imaging, intraoperative electrophysiology, and stimulation mapping. Electrophysiological mapping using extracellular microelectrode recordings aids in identifying functional subdomains, anatomical boundaries, and disease-correlated physiology. The shape of single-unit action potentials may differ due to different biophysical properties between cell-types and brain regions. Here, we describe a technique to parameterize the structure and duration of sorted spike units using a novel algorithmic approach based on canonical response parameterization, and illustrate how it may be used on DBS microelectrode recordings. Isolated spike shapes are parameterized then compared using a spike similarity metric and grouped by hierarchical clustering. When spike morphology is associated with anatomy, we find regional clustering in the human globus pallidus. This method is widely applicable for spike removal and single-unit characterization and could be integrated into intraoperative array-based technologies to enhance targeting and clinical outcomes in DBS lead placement.

">Muscle Cathepsin B treatment improves behavioral and neurogenic deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Muscle secretes factors during exercise that enhance cognition. Myokine Cathepsin B (Ctsb) is linked to memory function, but its role in neurodegenerative disease is unclear. Here we show that AAV-vector-mediated Ctsb overexpression in skeletal muscle in an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mouse model (APP/PS1), improves motor coordination, memory function and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, while plaque pathology and neuroinflammation remain unchanged. Additionally, in AD mice, Ctsb treatment modifies hippocampal, muscle and plasma proteomic profiles to resemble that of wildtype controls. Conversely, in wildtype mice, Ctsb expression causes memory deficits and results in protein profiles across tissues that are comparable to AD control mice. In AD mice, Ctsb treatment increases the abundance of hippocampal proteins involved in mRNA metabolism and protein synthesis, including those relevant to adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. Furthermore, Ctsb treatment enhances plasma metabolic and mitochondrial processes, and reduces inflammatory responses. In muscle, Ctsb expression elevates protein translation in AD mice, whereas in wildtype mice mitochondrial proteins decrease. Overall, the biological changes in the treatment groups are consistent with effects on memory function. Thus, skeletal muscle Ctsb application has potential as an AD therapeutic intervention.

">Virtual Brain Inference (VBI): A flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient probabilistic inference on virtual brain models</a></h4>

              
                Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling--also known as virtual brain modeling--combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node) with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales and across neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations, taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms, enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings. Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification, and contribute to advances in precision medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models.

">Doctoral Students as Carbon Accountants: Calculating Carbon Costs of a PhD in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                PhD students are drivers of innovation in research; however, the carbon intensity of PhD work is often unclear, especially in specialised STEM disciplines. Empowering PhD students to engage in carbon accounting could provide a powerful force for decarbonization in key areas of production and consumption in research communities. Here, we present a comprehensive life-cycle assessment for PhD work in a cellular neuroscience laboratory as part of a larger strategic effort to encourage PhD students to engage in carbon accounting. We measured Scope 1 emissions associated with anaesthetising animals and research-related travel. We then used regional conversion data openly reported by the UK National Grid through the Carbon Intensity API to accurately document time-specific Scope 2 emissions associated with neuroscience research activities, including widely used techniques like calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics. Finally, we estimated Scope 3 Emissions associated with procuring particular equipment and consumables using UK GOV 2024 reported conversion factors. Over 1 year, we accounted for 1.56 kg of direct carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), < 1942 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions associated with ground and air travel using radiative factor, 3.56 kg CO2e directly underpinning research activities, and 10.99 kg CO2e underlying indirect costs of laboratory facilities. Procurement of a subset of laboratory supplies were estimated to be in the range of < 543 kg CO2e. We discuss challenges of accurately estimating carbon footprints across disciplines in the UK and beyond. Here, we propose a common framework for including carbon life cycle analyses in Carbon Appendices to PhD theses and other publications. Overall, this work demonstrates how PhD students can measure the carbon footprint of their work and catalyse community-led efforts to decarbonize research that are efficient, targeted, and accurate.

">Single-cell spatial transcriptome reveals pathological features of human hippocampus with sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                More than half of epileptic patients ultimately turned to intractable epilepsy. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), the most common type of intractable epilepsies, whose pathological mechanism remains elusive. Here, using 42 human hippocampal samples from surgical donors of MTLE (32 with and 10 without HS) through single-cell resolution Stereo-seq and histologcial experiments, we revealed spatially pathological changes of gene expression and cell type composition with HS systematically. After precise parcellation of hippocampal subregions and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis between each region with and without sclerosis, we found Cornu Ammonis (CA) subregions with higher number of DEGs were vulnerable to sclerosis, especially CA1 and CA3. Within CA1, we found that CA1-superficial and proximal areas were more vulnerable than CA1-deep and distal areas in sclerosis. Meanwhile, after analyzing 350,795 segmented cells from Stereo-seq, we found dramatically increasing density of astrocyte accompanied with significantly decreasing density of excitatory neurons in CA1, especially superficial and proximal CA1, and CA3 in sclerosis. In these two vulnerable subregions, proliferative astrocyte (P_astrocyte) and reactive astrocyte (R_astrocyte) were found to be enriched whereas apoptotic subtype of astrocyte (A_astrocyte), related with apoptotic pathway, was mainly located in alveus, which strengthened cell communication with reactive microglia (R_microglia) in HS, revealing the novel pathological feature in our work. The pseudotime analysis indicated that CA excitatory neurons underwent synaptic impairment, energy dysfunction, aging, and finally losing cell identity until death through autophagy or apoptosis. Besides, we also found a resilient subtype, EX_CA2-4.3, highly expressed extracellular matrix related genes including PDYN, and was increasing the interaction of BDNF-NTRK, NFASC-CNTN1 to withstand the damage from sclerosis. Together, our study provided a reference of human hippocampus with and without HS caused by MTLE, and highlighted the potential pathological mechanism on molecular and cellular level of MTLE-HS.

">Effects of shock on perceptual learning in a virtual reality environment</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates two aspects of visual processing and perceptual learning: the impact of training on the human visual system's ability to integrate information across the visual field and the influence of aversive electrodermal stimulation on perceptual performance in an orientation averaging task. Through a ten-day training regimen that manipulated the set-size of Gabor element arrays, we observe consistent degradation in orientation averaging performance with increasing set-size, with training leading to overall improvements in accuracy and response times, but only a marginal interaction with set-size (for response times). This suggests that training-related enhancements likely operate at a post-integration and/or decisional stage of processing rather than at an early encoding stage. The second inquiry explores the effects of aversive stimuli on perceptual learning-based orientation averaging performance, with participants exposed to no shock, performance-contingent shock or random shock conditions. Our results show that while performance improved across training there was no discernible effect of the shock condition on task accuracy or response times and no evidence of an interaction with set size. State anxiety levels, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, indicated that whilst anxiety was elevated in both shock conditions, this was not associated with variations on orientation averaging performance. We also find that visual performance feedback, represented by a health bar, significantly influenced accuracy, but not response times, regardless of the presence or absence of shock. This unexpected impact of visual feedback suggests potential roles for attention and motivation in perceptual performance.

">Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Sudanese Candida parapsilosis: A Sustainable Approach to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health threat, particularly in Sudan, where the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Traditional methods to address AMR often fail to provide sustainable solutions. Nanotechnology offers promising alternatives, with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) demonstrating broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. This study aims to develop an eco-friendly synthesis of AgNPs using Candida parapsilosis isolated from Sudanese soil, leveraging untapped fungal biodiversity to combat AMR. Results: The Candida parapsilosis-mediated synthesis of AgNPs was successfully characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), confirming the formation of well-defined nanoparticles. The biosynthesized AgNPs exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative MDR pathogens. Medium concentrations of AgNPs demonstrated optimal activity, with inhibition zones up to 29 mm for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853). MIC and MBC assays revealed AgNPs' bactericidal efficacy, particularly against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.3125 mg/mL. Synergistic effects with antibiotics, such as ceftazidime and colistin, significantly enhanced antimicrobial activity, with fold increases up to 9.46. AgNPs disrupted bacterial membranes, as evidenced by increased permeability and leakage of nucleic acids. Conclusions: This study presents a novel and sustainable approach to combating AMR by utilizing Sudanese fungal strains for the green synthesis of AgNPs. The findings highlight the potential of AgNPs as an effective antibacterial agent, particularly in combination with conventional antibiotics, to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens. This research not only offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to AMR but also underscores the significant potential of integrating microbiology and nanotechnology to address global health challenges. The results could pave the way for future applications in both public health and environmental sustainability.

">Guess Who? Identifying individuals from their brain natural frequency fingerprints</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations are critical for brain function and cognition. Thus, identifying the typical or natural oscillatory frequencies of the brain is an important first step for understanding its functional architecture. Recently, a data-driven algorithm has been developed for mapping the brain's natural frequencies throughout the whole cortex, free of anatomical and frequency-band constraints. However, an important limitation of this methodology is that it yields robust results only at the group level. Here, we aimed to adapt this algorithm to improve the quality of the single-subject maps of natural frequencies obtained from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. To achieve this goal, we incorporated two modifications to the original method: (1) increasing the number of individual power spectra to be assigned to each k-means cluster, and (2) smoothing across neighboring voxels. To assess the quality of the single-subject maps, we relied on the fingerprinting technique. Our results show a high degree of accuracy in individual identification, both within a single recording session and across separate sessions. Furthermore, we were able to identify individuals by their natural frequency fingerprints, even with a gap of over four years between sessions. This demonstrates the robustness of the single-subject mapping of natural frequencies and opens new opportunities for identification of pathological variations in intrinsic oscillatory activity in individual subjects.

">Loss of the autism associated gene Tbr1 disrupts prediction and encoding by prefrontal ensembles during socioemotional behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Disruptions in many genes linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect synaptic function and socioemotional behaviors in mice. However, exactly how synaptic dysfunction alters neural activity patterns underlying behavior remains unknown. We addressed this using mice lacking the high confidence ASD gene Tbr1 in cortical layer 5 (L5) projection neurons (Tbr1 cKO mice). These mice have known deficits in synaptic input to L5 neurons and social behavior. We also find some abnormalities in anxiety-related avoidance. Calcium imaging of prefrontal L5 neurons revealed that despite reduced overall activity, cKO mice recruit normal numbers of neurons into prefrontal ensembles encoding social and anxiety-related behaviors. However, the stability, inter-neuronal coordination, and reactivation of social ensembles were diminished in cKO mice. Furthermore, in cKO mice, ensembles no longer predicted approach-avoidance decisions. These results reveal new aspects of how prefrontal ensembles encode socioemotional behaviors, and malfunction in the setting of ASD-linked gene disruption.

">A self-supervised deep learning pipeline for segmentation in two-photon fluorescence microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) allows in situ investigation of the structure and function of the brain at a cellular level, but the conventional image analyses of TPFM data are labour-intensive. Automated deep learning (DL)-based image processing pipelines used to analyze TPFM data require large labeled training datasets. Here, we developed a self supervised learning (SSL) pipeline to test whether unlabeled data can be used to boost the accuracy and generalizability of DL models for image segmentation in TPFM. We specifically developed four pretext tasks, including shuffling, rotation, axis rotation, and reconstruction, to train models without supervision using the UNet architecture. We validated our pipeline on two tasks (neuronal soma and vasculature segmentation), using large 3D microscopy datasets. We introduced a novel density-based metric, which provided more sensitive evaluation to downstream analysis tasks. We further determined the amount of labeled data required to reach performance on par with fully supervised learning (FSL) models. SSL-based models that were fine-tuned with only 50% of data were on par or superior (e.g., Dice increase of 3% for neuron segmentation and Dice score of 0.88 +/- 0.09 for vessel segmentation) to FSL models. We demonstrated that segmentation maps generated by SSL models pretrained on the reconstruction and rotation tasks can be better translated to downstream tasks than can other SSL tasks. Finally, we benchmarked all models on a publicly available out-of-distribution dataset, demonstrating that SSL models outperform FSL when trained with clean data, and are more robust than FSL models when trained with noisy data.

">The patient-specific mouse model with Foxg1 frameshift mutation provides insights into the pathophysiology of FOXG1 syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Single allelic mutations in the forebrain-specific transcription factor gene FOXG1 lead to FOXG1 syndrome (FS). To decipher the disease mechanisms of FS, which vary depending on FOXG1 mutation types, patient-specific animal models are critical. Here, we report the first patient specific FS mouse model, Q84Pfs heterozygous (84Pfs-Het) mice, which emulates one of the most predominant FS variants. Remarkably, Q84Pfs-Het mice recapitulate various human FS phenotypes across cellular, brain structural, and behavioral levels, such as microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis, movement disorders, repetitive behaviors, and anxiety. Q84Pfs-Het cortex showed dysregulations of genes controlling cell proliferation, neuronal projection and migration, synaptic assembly, and synaptic vesicle transport. Interestingly, the FS-causing Q84Pfs allele produced the N-terminal fragment of FOXG1, denoted as Q84Pfs protein, in Q84Pfs-Het mouse brains. Q84Pfs fragment forms intracellular speckles, interacts with FOXG1 full-length protein, and triggers the sequestration of FOXG1 to distinct subcellular domains. Q84Pfs protein also promotes the radial glial cell identity and suppresses neuronal migration in the cortex. Together, our study uncovered the role of the FOXG1 fragment derived from FScausing FOXG1 variants and identified the genes involved in FS-like cellular and behavioral phenotypes, providing essential insights into the pathophysiology of FS.

">Is cultural context the crucial touch? Neurophysiological and self-reported responses to affective touch in women in South Africa and the United Kingdom.</a></h4>

              
                Affective touch, involving touch-sensitive C-tactile (CT-) afferent nerve fibres, is integral to human development and wellbeing. Despite presumed cultural differences, affective touch research typically includes 'Western', minority-world contexts, with findings extrapolated cross-culturally. We report the first cross-cultural study to experimentally investigate subjective and neurophysiological correlates of affective touch in women in South Africa (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK) using (1) subjective touch ratings, and (2) cortical oscillations for slow CT-optimal (vs. faster non-CT-optimal) touch on two body regions (arm, palm). Cultural context modulated affective touch experiences: SA (vs. UK) participants rated touch as more positive and less intense, with enhanced differentiation in sensorimotor beta band oscillations, especially during palm touch. UK participants differentiated between stroking speeds, with opposite directions of effects at arm and palm for frontal theta oscillations. Results highlight the importance of cultural context in subjective experience and neural processing of affective touch.

	<p>Background: Approach and avoidance bias (AAB) describes automatic behavioral tendencies to react toward environmental stimuli regarding their emotional valence. Traditional setups have provided evidence but often lack ecological validity. The study of the AAB in naturalistic contexts has recently increased, revealing significant methodological challenges. This systematic review evaluates the use of virtual reality (VR) and real-world setups to study the AAB, summarizing methodological innovations and challenges. Methods: We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles employing VR and real-world setups to investigate the AAB. We analyzed experimental designs, stimuli, response metrics, and technical aspects to assess their alignment with research objectives and identify limitations. Results: This review included 14 studies revealing diverse methodologies, stimulus types, and novel behavioral responses, highlighting significant variability in design strategies and methodological coherence. Several studies used traditional reaction time measures yet varied in their application of VR technology and participant interaction paradigms. Some studies showed discrepancies between simulated and natural bodily actions, while others showcased more integrated approaches that preserved their integrity. Only a minority of studies included control conditions or acquired (neuro)physiological data. Conclusions: VR offers a potential ecological setup for studying the AAB, enabling dynamic and immersive interactions. Our results underscore the importance of establishing a coherent framework for investigating the AAB tendencies using VR. Addressing the foundational challenges of developing baseline principles that guide VR-based designs to study the AAB within naturalistic contexts is essential for advancing the AAB research and application. This will ultimately contribute to more reliable and reproducible experimental paradigms and develop effective interventions that help individuals recognize and change their biases, fostering more balanced behaviors.</p>

	<p>Background: Exercise addiction, marked by an inability to control exercise and associated with distress that clinically impairs daily activities, is a significant but underrecognized issue in physical activity and health. While its physiological, psychological, and behavioral aspects have been studied, the genetic basis of exercise addiction remains poorly understood, requiring further investigation. The present study conducted a genome-wide association study of exercise addiction among elite Turkish wrestlers. Methods: The sample comprised 67 male wrestlers (34 freestyle wrestlers and 33 Greco-Roman wrestlers). Exercise addiction was assessed using the Exercise Addiction Scale. Whole-genome genotyping was performed using DNA microarray. Results: Using a genome-wide approach (p &amp;amp;lt; 1.0 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;#8309;), we identified six suggestively significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with exercise addiction status. Of these, the high-addiction alleles of five SNPs (PRDM10 rs74345126, near PTPRU rs72652685, HADHB rs6745226, XIRP2 rs17614860, and near GAREM2 rs1025542) have previously been associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression or higher levels of physical activity. We also examined potential associations between the genetic markers previously linked to addiction-related traits such as obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder and cigarette smoking, and personality traits linked to negative emotions including neuroticism. Using this candidate gene approach (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), we identified three additional SNPs associated with exercise addiction in the same direction of association (DEFB135 rs4841662, BCL11A rs7599488, and CSRNP3 rs1551336). Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary evidence for the genetic basis of exercise addiction, highlighting specific SNPs that may play a role in the development of this condition among elite wrestlers.</p>

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                Background Cervical cancer poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Despite advancements in treatment, the disease remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Chemoradiation utilizing cisplatin has been the cornerstone therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, including hematological parameters, have emerged as valuable tools in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes. Methodology Data from patients treated between January 2021 and June 2022 were analyzed. Demographic information, histopathology, pre-treatment blood parameters, treatment details, and response assessments were collected. The parameters assessed included hemoglobin levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and eosinophil albumin ratio (EAR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine optimal cut-off values for these biomarkers. Results Of the 140 patients included, the majority had squamous cell carcinoma (92%) and were at stage II or III. Complete response to treatment was observed in 86.4% of patients. Non-responders demonstrated significantly higher levels of hemoglobin, NLR, and EAR, along with lower PNI levels compared to responders. ROC analysis revealed cut-off values for hemoglobin (< 9.5), NLR (< 2.98), PLR (> 289.26), PNI (< 37.67), and EAR (< 49.63) associated with treatment response. Conclusion The study highlights the potential utility of pre-treatment blood parameters as predictive markers for treatment response in locally advanced cervical cancer. Lower hemoglobin, higher NLR, and EAR, along with reduced PNI, were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could aid in treatment planning and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of these biomarkers in guiding personalized treatment strategies for cervical cancer patients.

                Abstract* Background Intensive care units (ICUs) are essential for patient recovery, but prolonged stays often result in complications like reduced mobility and muscle weakness. Aims This study examines current ICU rehabilitation practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through a web-based cross-sectional survey involving 80 physiotherapists from both public and private sectors. Methods The questionnaire, validated by experts with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.84, explored various rehabilitation strategies. Most participants held bachelor’s degrees and had 2-5 years of experience. Results Over 96% required physician referrals for ICU physiotherapy sessions, and 75% noted that hospitals provided development programs to enhance skills. Respiratory therapy, joint mobilization, and electrical stimulation were the most commonly used interventions, while massage, continuous passive motion machines, and taping were less frequently applied. Among neonatal ICU patients, 85.7% of physiotherapists regularly performed passive range of motion exercises, and 69% consistently involved parents in the treatment plan. The results indicate a variety of practices among ICU physiotherapists in the UAE, with no clear adherence to standardized protocols. This lack of consistency may negatively affect patient care quality. Conclusion The study underscores the importance of implementing standardized rehabilitation protocols and enhancing patient education to improve outcomes in ICU settings.

It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model.

                <p>by Xiaojun Wu, MeiLu McDermott, Adam L MacLean</p>

Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and is limited in its ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising of the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using sparse regression. We show, via model selection, that model discovery using hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.

                <p>by Meichen Fang, Gennady Gorin, Lior Pachter</p>

Single-cell transcriptomics experiments provide gene expression snapshots of heterogeneous cell populations across cell states. These snapshots have been used to infer trajectories and dynamic information even without intensive, time-series data by ordering cells according to gene expression similarity. However, while single-cell snapshots sometimes offer valuable insights into dynamic processes, current methods for ordering cells are limited by descriptive notions of “pseudotime” that lack intrinsic physical meaning. Instead of pseudotime, we propose inference of “process time” via a principled modeling approach to formulating trajectories and inferring latent variables corresponding to timing of cells subject to a biophysical process. Our implementation of this approach, called Chronocell, provides a biophysical formulation of trajectories built on cell state transitions. The Chronocell model is identifiable, making parameter inference meaningful. Furthermore, Chronocell can interpolate between trajectory inference, when cell states lie on a continuum, and clustering, when cells cluster into discrete states. By using a variety of datasets ranging from cluster-like to continuous, we show that Chronocell enables us to assess the suitability of datasets and reveals distinct cellular distributions along process time that are consistent with biological process times. We also compare our parameter estimates of degradation rates to those derived from metabolic labeling datasets, thereby showcasing the biophysical utility of Chronocell. Nevertheless, based on performance characterization on simulations, we find that process time inference can be challenging, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and careful model assessment.

                <p>by Peng Ren, Xuehua Cui, Xia Liang</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration or death of neurons. The complexity of clinical symptoms and irreversibility of disease progression significantly affects individual lives, leading to premature mortality. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases keeps increasing, yet the specific pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood and effective treatment strategies are lacking. In recent years, convergent experimental evidence supports the “prion-like transmission” assumption that abnormal proteins induce misfolding of normal proteins, and these misfolded proteins propagate throughout the neural networks to cause neuronal death. To elucidate this dynamic process in vivo from a computational perspective, researchers have proposed three connectome-based biophysical models to simulate the spread of pathological proteins: the Network Diffusion Model, the Epidemic Spreading Model, and the agent-based Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. These models have demonstrated promising predictive capabilities. This review focuses on the explanations of their fundamental principles and applications. Then, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models. Building upon this foundation, we introduce new directions for model optimization and propose a unified framework for the evaluation of connectome-based biophysical models. We expect that this review could lower the entry barrier for researchers in this field, accelerate model optimization, and thereby advance the clinical translation of connectome-based biophysical models.

                <p>by Nan Wu, Zhi-Chao Xu, Kai-Dong Du, Shen Huang, Naohiro Kobayashi, Yutaka Kuroda, Yan-Hong Bai</p>

<i>Gaussia</i> Luciferase (GLuc) is a renowned reporter protein that can catalyze the oxidation of coelenterazine (CTZ) and emit a bright light signal. GLuc comprises two consecutive repeats that form the enzyme body and a central putative catalytic cavity. However, deleting the C-terminal repeat only limited reduces the activity (over 30% residual luminescence intensity detectable), despite being a key part of the cavity. How does the remaining GLuc (tGLuc) catalyze CTZ? To address this question, we built a structural model of tGLuc by removing the C-terminal repeat from the resolved structure of intact GLuc, and verified that the cavity-forming component in GLuc remains stable and provides an open-mouth cavity in tGLuc during 500 ns MD simulations in water. Docking simulation and a followed umbrella sampling analysis further revealed that the cavity on tGLuc has a high affinity for CTZ, with a binding energy of up to -114 kJ/mol. Moreover, R76, a validated activity-critical amino acid residue, resides in the cavity and forms a stable hydrogen bond with CTZ. Then, we constructed a cluster model to examine the CTZ oxidation pathway in the cavity using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The result showed that the pathway consists of four elementary reactions, with the highest Gibbs energy barrier being 65.4 kJ/mol. Both intramolecular electron transfer and the convergence of S1/S0 potential energy surfaces occurred in the last elementary reaction, which was regarded as the reported Chemically-Initiated-Electron-Exchange-Luminescence (CIEEL) reaction. Geometry and wavefunction analysis on the pathway indicated that R76 plays a vital role in CTZ oxidation, which first anchors the environmental oxygen molecule and induces it to form a singlet biradical state, facilitating its attack on CTZ. Subsequently, R76 and the adjacent Q88, positioned near R76 through the tGLuc refolding process, stabilize the transition states and facilitate the emergence of radical electrons on CTZ at the onset of the CIEEL reaction, which contributes to the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer and the production of excited amide product. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of tGLuc’s catalytic mechanism. However, it is important to note that these findings are specific to tGLuc and may not extend to other CTZ-based luciferases, particularly those lacking arginine in their catalytic cavities, which likely operate via distinct mechanisms.

                <p>by Alessandro Pazzaglia, Andrej Bicanski, Andrea Ferrario, Jonathan Arreguit, Dimitri Ryczko, Auke Ijspeert</p>

This study introduces a novel neuromechanical model employing a detailed spiking neural network to explore the role of axial proprioceptive sensory feedback, namely stretch feedback, in salamander locomotion. Unlike previous studies that often oversimplified the dynamics of the locomotor networks, our model includes detailed simulations of the classes of neurons that are considered responsible for generating movement patterns. The locomotor circuits, modeled as a spiking neural network of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, are coupled to a three-dimensional mechanical model of a salamander with realistic physical parameters and simulated muscles. In open-loop simulations (i.e., without sensory feedback), the model replicates locomotor patterns observed in-vitro and in-vivo for swimming and trotting gaits. Additionally, a modular descending reticulospinal drive to the central pattern generation network allows to accurately control the activation, frequency and phase relationship of the different sections of the limb and axial circuits. In closed-loop swimming simulations (i.e. including axial stretch feedback), systematic evaluations reveal that intermediate values of feedback strength increase the tail beat frequency and reduce the intersegmental phase lag, contributing to a more coordinated, faster and energy-efficient locomotion. Interestingly, the result is conserved across different feedback topologies (ascending or descending, excitatory or inhibitory), suggesting that it may be an inherent property of axial proprioception. Moreover, intermediate feedback strengths expand the stability region of the network, enhancing its tolerance to a wider range of descending drives, internal parameters’ modifications and noise levels. Conversely, high values of feedback strength lead to a loss of controllability of the network and a degradation of its locomotor performance. Overall, this study highlights the beneficial role of proprioception in generating, modulating and stabilizing locomotion patterns, provided that it does not excessively override centrally-generated locomotor rhythms. This work also underscores the critical role of detailed, biologically-realistic neural networks to improve our understanding of vertebrate locomotion.

Coronaviruses express their structural and accessory genes via a set of subgenomic RNAs, whose synthesis is directed by transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) in the 5′ genomic leader and upstream of each body open reading frame. In SARS-CoV-2, the TRS has the consensus AAACGAAC; upon searching for emergence of this motif in the global SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we find that it evolves frequently, especially in the 3′ end of the genome. We show well-supported examples upstream of the Spike gene—within the nsp16 coding region of ORF1b—which is expressed during human infection, and upstream of the canonical Envelope gene TRS, both of which have evolved convergently in multiple lineages. The most frequent neo-TRS is within the coding region of the Nucleocapsid gene, and is present in virtually all viruses from the B.1.1 lineage, including the variants of concern Alpha, Gamma, Omicron and descendants thereof. Here, we demonstrate that this TRS leads to the expression of a novel subgenomic mRNA encoding a truncated C-terminal portion of Nucleocapsid, which is an antagonist of type I interferon production and contributes to viral fitness during infection. We observe distinct phenotypes when the Nucleocapsid coding sequence is mutated compared to when the TRS alone is ablated. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing evolutionary changes at the functional RNA level in addition to the amino acid level.

                <p>by Cas W. Coopmans, Helen de Hoop, Filiz Tezcan, Peter Hagoort, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Studies of perception have long shown that the brain adds information to its sensory analysis of the physical environment. A touchstone example for humans is language use: to comprehend a physical signal like speech, the brain must add linguistic knowledge, including syntax. Yet, syntactic rules and representations are widely assumed to be atemporal (i.e., abstract and not bound by time), so they must be translated into time-varying signals for speech comprehension and production. Here, we test 3 different models of the temporal spell-out of syntactic structure against brain activity of people listening to Dutch stories: an integratory bottom-up parser, a predictive top-down parser, and a mildly predictive left-corner parser. These models build exactly the same structure but differ in when syntactic information is added by the brain—this difference is captured in the (temporal distribution of the) complexity metric “incremental node count.” Using temporal response function models with both acoustic and information-theoretic control predictors, node counts were regressed against source-reconstructed delta-band activity acquired with magnetoencephalography. Neural dynamics in left frontal and temporal regions most strongly reflect node counts derived by the top-down method, which postulates syntax early in time, suggesting that predictive structure building is an important component of Dutch sentence comprehension. The absence of strong effects of the left-corner model further suggests that its mildly predictive strategy does not represent Dutch language comprehension well, in contrast to what has been found for English. Understanding when the brain projects its knowledge of syntax onto speech, and whether this is done in language-specific ways, will inform and constrain the development of mechanistic models of syntactic structure building in the brain.

A single exposure to a stressful event can result in enduring changes in behaviour. Long-term modifications in neuronal networks induced by stress are well explored but the initial steps leading to these alterations remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that acute stress exposure triggers an immediate increase in the firing activity of calretinin-positive neurons in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT/CR+) that persists for several days in mice. This increase in activity had a causal role in stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. Attenuating PVT/CR+ neuronal activity for only 1 h after the stress event rescued both the protracted increase in PVT/CR+ firing rate and the stress-induced behavioural alterations. Activation of the key forebrain targets (basolateral amygdala, prelimbic cortex, and nucleus accumbens) that mediate defensive behaviour has also been reduced by this post-stress inhibition. Reduction of PVT/CR+ cell activity 5 days later remained still effective in ameliorating stress-induced changes in spontaneous behaviour. The results demonstrate a critical role of the prolonged, post-stress changes in firing activity of PVT/CR+ neurons in shaping the behavioural changes associated with stress. Our data proposes a therapeutic window for intervention in acute stress-related disorders, offering potential avenues for targeted treatment strategies.

Bacteriophages infect gram-negative bacteria by attaching to molecules present on the bacterial surface, often lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Modification of LPS can lead to resistance to phage infection. In addition, LPS modifications can impact antibiotic susceptibility, allowing for phage–antibiotic synergism. The evolutionary mechanism(s) behind such synergistic interactions remain largely unclear. Here, we show that the presence of antibiotics can affect the evolution of resistance to phage infection, using phage ΦX174 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> C. We use a collection of 34 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C LPS strains, each of which is resistant to ΦX174, and has either a “rough” or “deep rough” LPS phenotype. Growth of the bacterial strains with the deep rough phenotype is inhibited at low concentrations of chloramphenicol and, to a much lesser degree, gentamicin. Treating <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C wild type with ΦX174 and chloramphenicol eliminates the emergence of mutants with the deep rough phenotype, and thereby slows the evolution of resistance to phage infection. At slightly lower chloramphenicol concentrations, phage resistance rates are similar to those observed at high concentrations; yet, we show that the diversity of possible mutants is much larger than at higher chloramphenicol concentrations. These data suggest that specific antibiotic concentrations can lead to synergistic phage–antibiotic interactions that disappear at higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, we show that the change in survival of various ΦX174-resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> C mutants in the presence of antibiotics can explain the observed phage–antibiotic synergism.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections drive one in 20 new cancer cases, exerting a particularly high burden on women. Most anogenital HPV infections are cleared in less than two years, but the underlying mechanisms that favour persistence in around 10% of women remain largely unknown. Notwithstanding, it is precisely this information that is crucial for improving treatment, screening, and vaccination strategies. To understand viral and immune dynamics in non-persisting HPV infections, we set up an observational longitudinal cohort study with frequent on-site visits for biological sample collection. We enrolled 189 women aged from 18 to 25 and living in the area of Montpellier (France) between 2016 and 2020. We performed 974 on-site visits for a total of 1,619 months of follow-up. We collected data on virus load, local immune cell populations, local concentrations of cytokines, and circulating antibody titres. Using hierarchical Bayesian statistical modelling to simultaneously analyse the data from 164 HPV infections from 76 participants, we show that in two months after infection, HPV viral load in non-persisting infections reaches a plateau that lasts on average for 13 to 20 months (95% credibility interval) and is then followed by a rapid clearance phase. This first description of the dynamics of HPV infections comes with the identification of immune correlates associated with infection clearance, especially gamma-delta T cells and CXCL10 concentration. A limitation of this study on HPV kinetics is that many infection follow-ups are censored. Furthermore, some immune cell populations are difficult to label because cervical immunity is less well characterised than systemic immunity. These results open new perspectives for understanding the frontier between acute and chronic infections, and for controlling HPV-associated diseases, as well as for research on human cancers of infectious origin.

<p>This study refines microCT techniques for imaging spider neuroanatomy, focusing on size variation. The phosphatetungstic acid (PTA) staining agent was most effective for staining spider CNS structures. The research provides optimized protocols, reducing troubleshooting time, and improving image quality, thereby advancing the study of spider central nervous systems.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Recent advances in microCT are facilitating the investigation of microstructures in spiders and insects leading to an increased number of studies investigating their neuroanatomy. Although microCT is a powerful tool, its effectiveness depends on appropriate tissue preparation and scan settings, particularly for soft, non-sclerotized tissues, such as muscles, organs, and neural tissues. As the application of microCT in spiders is only in its infancy, published protocols are often difficult to implement due to substantial size variation of the specimens. The present study was initiated to determine how to account for this variation. Our work builds on previous methods using microCT to image spider brains, with the aim to consolidate current knowledge and reduce time spent troubleshooting appropriate methodology, thereby facilitating future studies of spiders and their central nervous systems (CNS). We tested three different preparation and imaging techniques based on published protocols with minor modifications using 216 spiders with prosoma lengths ranging from 1.25 mm (small spiders) to 13.33 mm (large spiders). We compared the efficacy of the various specimen preparations, staining methods, and scan settings by categorizing the quality of dorsal and lateral microCT scans. We observed that only the phosphotungstic acid (PTA) staining agent resulted in complete staining of the prosoma and the CNS, allowing the CNS structures to be distinguished for small, medium, and large spiders. The use of image averaging, increased number of projections, image exposure timing, and detector binning did not greatly affect image quality for small and larger spiders but reduced noise. These settings did help improve image quality for medium spiders in conjunction with higher resolutions and an aluminum filter. We discussed the suitability of methods concerning spider size, effort, chemical risk, and image quality.</p>

                Despite extensive functional mapping studies using rodent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), interpreting the fMRI signals in relation to their neuronal origins remains challenging due to the hemodynamic nature of the response. Ultra high-resolution rodent fMRI, beyond merely enhancing spatial specificity, has revealed vessel-specific hemodynamic responses, highlighting the distinct contributions of intracortical arterioles and venules to fMRI signals. This ‘single-vessel’ fMRI approach shifts the paradigm of rodent fMRI, enabling its integration with other neuroimaging modalities to investigate neuro-glio-vascular (NGV) signaling underlying a variety of brain dynamics. Here, we review the emerging trend of combining multimodal fMRI with opto/chemogenetic neuromodulation and genetically encoded biosensors for cellular and circuit-specific recording, offering unprecedented opportunities for cross-scale brain dynamic mapping in rodent models.

                How do you know you have heard right? Metacognition, the ability to assess and monitor one’s own cognitive state, is key to understanding human communication in complex environments. However, the foundational role of metacognition in hearing and communication is only beginning to be explored, and the neuroscience behind it is an emerging field: how does confidence express in neural dynamics of the listening brain? What is known about auditory metaperceptual alterations as a hallmark phenomenon in psychosis, dementia, or hearing loss? Building on Bayesian ideas of auditory perception and auditory neuroscience, ‘meta-listening’ offers a framework for more comprehensive research into how metacognition in humans and non-humans shapes the listening brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100488">Mixed representations of choice direction and outcome by GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) are an evolutionarily conserved and phylogenetically old set of sub-cortical nuclei that guide action selection, evaluation, and reinforcement. The entopeduncular nucleus (EP) is a major BG output nucleus that contains a population of GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons (EP<i><sup>Sst+</sup></i>) that specifically target the lateral habenula (LHb) and whose function in behavior remains mysterious. Here, we use a probabilistic switching task that requires an animal to maintain flexible relationships between action selection and evaluation to examine when and how GABA/glutamate cotransmitting neurons contribute to behavior. We find that EP<i><sup>Sst+</sup></i> neurons are strongly engaged during this task and show bidirectional changes in activity during the choice and outcome periods of a trial. We then tested the effects of either permanently blocking cotransmission or modifying the GABA/glutamate ratio on behavior in well-trained animals. Neither manipulation produced detectable changes in behavior despite significant changes in synaptic transmission in the LHb, demonstrating that the outputs of these neurons are not required for ongoing action-outcome updating in a probabilistic switching task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94420">Paradoxical dominant negative activity of an immunodeficiency-associated activating PIK3R1 variant</a></h4>

              
                <i>PIK3R1</i> encodes three regulatory subunits of class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), each associating with any of three catalytic subunits, namely p110α, p110β, or p110δ. Constitutional <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations cause diseases with a genotype-phenotype relationship not yet fully explained: heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause SHORT syndrome, featuring insulin resistance and short stature attributed to reduced p110α function, while heterozygous activating mutations cause immunodeficiency, attributed to p110δ activation and known as APDS2. Surprisingly, APDS2 patients do not show features of p110α hyperactivation, but do commonly have SHORT syndrome-like features, suggesting p110α hypofunction. We sought to investigate this. In dermal fibroblasts from an APDS2 patient, we found no increased PI3K signalling, with p110δ expression markedly reduced. In preadipocytes, the APDS2 variant was potently dominant negative, associating with Irs1 and Irs2 but failing to heterodimerise with p110α. This attenuation of p110α signalling by a p110δ-activating PIK3R1 variant potentially explains co-incidence of gain-of-function and loss-of-function <i>PIK3R1</i> phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99642">Endopiriform neurons projecting to ventral CA1 are a critical node for recognition memory</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum complex is viewed as fundamental for higher-order cognition; however, the circuit organization and function of its neuroanatomical subregions are not well understood. We demonstrated that some of the key roles of the CLA complex can be attributed to the connectivity and function of a small group of neurons in its ventral subregion, the endopiriform (EN). We identified a subpopulation of EN neurons by their projection to the ventral CA1 (EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons), embedded in recurrent circuits with other EN neurons and the piriform cortex. Although the EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neuron activity was biased toward novelty across stimulus categories, their chemogenetic inhibition selectively disrupted the memory-guided but not innate responses of mice to novelty. Based on our functional connectivity analysis, we suggest that EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons serve as an essential node for recognition memory through recurrent circuits mediating sustained attention to novelty, and through feed-forward inhibition of distal vCA1 neurons shifting memory-guided behavior from familiarity to novelty.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99010">Syngeneic natural killer cell therapy activates dendritic and T cells in metastatic lungs and effectively treats low-burden metastases</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells can control metastasis through cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production independently of T cells in experimental metastasis mouse models. The inverse correlation between NK activity and metastasis incidence supports a critical role for NK cells in human metastatic surveillance. However, autologous NK cell therapy has shown limited benefit in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors. Using a spontaneous metastasis mouse model of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, we found that transfer of IL-15/IL-12-conditioned syngeneic NK cells after primary tumor resection promoted long-term survival of mice with low metastatic burden and induced a tumor-specific protective T cell response that is essential for the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, NK cell transfer augments activation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and stem cell-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in metastatic lungs, to which IFN-γ of the transferred NK cells contributes significantly. These results imply direct interactions between transferred NK cells and endogenous cDCs to enhance T cell activation. We conducted an investigator-initiated clinical trial of autologous NK cell therapy in six patients with advanced cancer and observed that the NK cell therapy was safe and showed signs of effectiveness. These findings indicate that autologous NK cell therapy is effective in treating established low burden metastases of MHC-I<sup>+</sup> tumor cells by activating the cDC-T cell axis at metastatic sites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94961">Effects of noise and metabolic cost on cortical task representations</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility requires both the encoding of task-relevant and the ignoring of task-irrelevant stimuli. While the neural coding of task-relevant stimuli is increasingly well understood, the mechanisms for ignoring task-irrelevant stimuli remain poorly understood. Here, we study how task performance and biological constraints jointly determine the coding of relevant and irrelevant stimuli in neural circuits. Using mathematical analyses and task-optimized recurrent neural networks, we show that neural circuits can exhibit a range of representational geometries depending on the strength of neural noise and metabolic cost. By comparing these results with recordings from primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the course of learning, we show that neural activity in PFC changes in line with a minimal representational strategy. Specifically, our analyses reveal that the suppression of dynamically irrelevant stimuli is achieved by activity-silent, sub-threshold dynamics. Our results provide a normative explanation as to why PFC implements an adaptive, minimal representational strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99997">Tripartite organization of brain state dynamics underlying spoken narrative comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension involves the dynamic interplay of multiple cognitive processes, from basic sound perception, to linguistic encoding, and finally to complex semantic-conceptual interpretations. How the brain handles the diverse streams of information processing remains poorly understood. Applying Hidden Markov Modeling to fMRI data obtained during spoken narrative comprehension, we reveal that the whole brain networks predominantly oscillate within a tripartite latent state space. These states are, respectively, characterized by high activities in the sensory-motor (State #1), bilateral temporal (State #2), and default mode networks (DMN; State #3) regions, with State #2 acting as a transitional hub. The three states are selectively modulated by the acoustic, word-level semantic, and clause-level semantic properties of the narrative. Moreover, the alignment with both the best performer and the group-mean in brain state expression can predict participants’ narrative comprehension scores measured from the post-scan recall. These results are reproducible with different brain network atlas and generalizable to two datasets consisting of young and older adults. Our study suggests that the brain underlies narrative comprehension by switching through a tripartite state space, with each state probably dedicated to a specific component of language faculty, and effective narrative comprehension relies on engaging those states in a timely manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100767">Aberrant FGF signaling promotes granule neuron precursor expansion in SHH subgroup infantile medulloblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway genes, for example, <i>Suppressor of Fused</i> (SUFU), drive granule neuron precursors (GNP) to form medulloblastomas (MB<sup>SHH</sup>). However, how different molecular lesions in the Shh pathway drive transformation is frequently unclear, and <i>SUFU</i> mutations in the cerebellum seem distinct. In this study, we show that fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) signaling is integral for many infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> cases and that <i>FGF5</i> expression is uniquely upregulated in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors. Similarly, mice lacking SUFU (Sufu-cKO) ectopically express <i>Fgf5</i> specifically along the secondary fissure where GNPs harbor preneoplastic lesions and show that FGFR signaling is also ectopically activated in this region. Treatment with an FGFR antagonist rescues the severe GNP hyperplasia and restores cerebellar architecture. Thus, direct inhibition of FGF signaling may be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>.

	<p>Background: Musculoskeletal injuries can have far-reaching consequences on brain function, leading to reduced motor control, altered movement patterns, increased inhibition of the injured muscle and joint, and changes in neuroplasticity. These deficits, controlled in part by the central nervous system (CNS), might be alleviated with an appropriate adjuvant treatment. One possibly suited treatment at the CNS level is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which modulates cortical excitability and further neuroplasticity. Objectives: The present review outlines the multifaceted repercussions of common musculo-skeletal injuries on CNS functions and presents original studies that mostly report beneficial effects regarding the use of the tDCS intervention in people who had experienced musculoskeletal injury rehabilitation. Results: The first evidence suggests that tDCS, targeting brain areas responsible for motor control or on sensory and pain-related brain regions, may offer significant benefits in the recovery of brain function and motor performance following musculoskeletal injuries. Key findings include enhanced motor function, altered CNS excitability and inhibition, and reduced pain perception, all contributing to improved rehabilitation outcomes. However, the paucity of studies and the heterogeneity of injuries render it challenging to ascertain the optimal treatment parameters. Furthermore, the variability regarding stimulation parameters is a crucial aspect that remains to be addressed and limits the possibility of generalizing these first findings. Conclusions: It is concluded that well-powered trials with standardized protocols should be conducted to confirm these effects and establish clear clinical guidelines for the use of tDCS in sports injury rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Switching between different tasks incurs switch costs. Previous research has demonstrated that rewards can enhance performance in cognitive tasks. However, prior studies have primarily focused on the overall improvement in cognitive task performance, with limited research on how different types of rewards function under various task conditions. This study aims to investigate the distinct effects of immediate and delayed rewards on cognitive task performance in different task conditions (repeated trials and task-switching trials) and to explore the underlying neural mechanisms, particularly focusing on how rewards influence attention allocation during the concurrent processing of multiple cues. Methods: This study recruited 27 college students (average age 19 years old, 10 males and 17 females). A cue-based task-switching paradigm incorporating immediate and delayed rewards was employed. The study examined the effects of immediate and delayed rewards on cognitive task performance in repeated trials and task-switching trials. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying reward effects on attention allocation. Results: Behavioral results indicated that immediate rewards significantly enhanced performance in repeated trials compared to delayed rewards. In contrast, no significant difference between immediate and delayed rewards was observed in task-switching trials. ERP results showed that immediate rewards induced a larger P300 amplitude than delayed rewards under the task repetition condition. No P300 difference was found between immediate and delayed rewards under the task-switching condition. Conclusions: The findings suggest that rewards enhance task performance by optimizing the allocation of attention to the ongoing task when multiple cues are processed concurrently. When additional resources are required to process task-related cues, there may be insufficient remaining capacity to effectively process reward cues, which could be essential for the optimal completion of the task. These results support the Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory in task-switching scenarios.</p>

	<p>Background: Fluorocitrate (FC) ranging from 5 &amp;amp;mu;M to 5 mM is often used as a specific metabolic inhibitor of the astrocytes to study astrocytic functions. Whether FC at such concentrations may affect neuronal metabolism and function in vivo remains unclear. Methods: We examined the effects of FC on the ATP levels and Ca2+ activity of the astrocytes and neurons in the motor cortices of living mice using two-photon microscopy. Results: We found that 25 &amp;amp;mu;M and 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC decreased the intracellular ATP levels and Ca2+ activity in the astrocytes in the motor cortex. Equally, 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC, but not 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC, reduced the intracellular ATP levels in the dendritic processes of the layer 5 pyramidal neurons. However, 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC increased the neuronal Ca2+ activity, whereas &amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC decreased it. To test whether the differential effects of FC on neuronal Ca2+ activity reflect the direct effect of FC on the neurons or its indirect effect on the astrocytes, we used the CNO-hM3Dq chemogenetic approach to block astrocytic Ca2+ activity and examined the effect of FC. In the absence of astrocytic Ca2+ activity, 25 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC still increased and &amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC reduced the dendritic Ca2+ activity of the neurons, respectively, suggesting a direct effect of 250 &amp;amp;mu;M of FC on inhibiting neuronal Ca2+ activity. Further, 250 &amp;amp;mu;M, but not 25 &amp;amp;mu;M, of FC increased the size of the dendritic spines over 2 h. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that FC at high concentrations (&amp;amp;ge;250 &amp;amp;mu;M) is not a specific inhibitor of astrocytic functions, as it directly affects neuronal metabolism and synaptic plasticity in vivo.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Motor neurorehabilitation can be realized by gradually learning diverse motor imagery (MI) tasks. EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an effective solution. Nevertheless, existing MI decoding methods cannot balance plasticity for unseen tasks and stability for old tasks. This paper proposes a generative diffusion-based task Incremental Learning (IL) method called GD-TIL. Methods: First, data augmentation is employed to increase data diversity by segmenting and recombining EEG signals. Second, to capture temporal-spatial features (TSFs) from different temporal resolutions, a multi-scale temporal-spatial feature extractor (MTSFE) is developed via integrating multiscale temporal-spatial convolutions, a dual-branch pooling operation, multiple multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and a dynamic convolutional encoder. The proposed self-supervised task generalization (SSTG) mechanism introduces a regularization constraint to guide MTSFE and unified classifier updating, which combines labels and semantic similarity between the augmentation with original views to enhance model generalizability for unseen tasks. In the IL phase, a prototype-guided generative replay module (PGGR) is used to generate old tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; TSFs by training a lightweight diffusion model based on the prototype and label of each task. Furthermore, the generated TSF is merged with a new TSF to fine-tune the convolutional encoder and update the classifier and PGGR. Finally, GD-TIL is evaluated on a self-collected ADL-MI dataset with two MI pairs and a public dataset with four MI tasks. Results: The continuous decoding accuracy reaches 80.20% and 81.32%, respectively. The experimental results exhibit the excellent plasticity and stability of GD-TIL, even beating the state-of-the-art IL methods. Conclusions: Our work illustrates the potential of MI-based BCI and generative AI for continuous neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background: E-cigarettes, initially designed for nicotine consumption, are now increasingly being used to smoke cannabis, resulting in a growing trend known as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual vaping&amp;amp;rdquo;. This term describes individuals, referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;dual users&amp;amp;rdquo;, who use e-cigarettes for both substances. This study aims to review and analyze existing research on dual vaping, with a focus on the associated health risks and behavioral patterns. Methods: A narrative review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. Studies focusing on individuals who use electronic cigarettes for vaping tobacco and cannabis, either chronically or episodically, were examined. Relevant articles were identified and thematically synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. Results: Dual vaping was found to be prevalent among younger men, White and Hispanic populations, and individuals with higher economic status and educational level. The use of one substance was shown to predispose individuals to the use of the other, often leading to concurrent use of both substances. Peer influence and positive expectations regarding e-cigarettes were identified as significant predictors of dual use. Dual vapers exhibited a higher susceptibility to respiratory and systemic symptoms compared to those who exclusively vaped nicotine or cannabis. Moreover, a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorders, anxiety, and depression, was observed in this group. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most preferred option among dual vapers when using both nicotine and cannabis. Conclusions: Current evidence is insufficient to fully elucidate the long-term impacts of dual vaping on physical and mental health, particularly when compared to individuals who have never vaped. Further studies are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this behavior.</p>

                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, analysing the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. Using a causal loop diagram approach (CLD), the study aims to identify key factors to effective implementation, how they interact to shape the outcome of the policy, and actionable strategies to address the challenges hindering the policy sustainability. Method A participatory approach was used to developing the CLD, integrating insights from an extensive literature review and stakeholder opinion. The initial CLD was constructed based on evidence from prior research contextualizing fee-free higher education within South Africa’s unique socio-political sector. Discussions with stakeholders and experts provided critical feedback to refine the model, ensuring its relevance and accuracy. The CLD methodology was selected for its ability to illustrate complex interdependencies and systemic challenges. Results Key findings highlight the impact of funding constraints, which create reinforcing feedback loops limiting access and infrastructure improvements. Also, administrative inefficiencies within the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) result in delays and inconsistencies, reducing policy inclusivity, and decentralized implementation across institutions perpetuates disparities in quality and access. Conclusion The study concludes the urgent need for systemic reforms, including digitising financial aid processes, centralising NSFAS operations, and improving resource allocation to under-resourced institutions. Furthermore, the study aligns with global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), as well as the African Agenda 2063’s focus on human capital development. While the findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers, further research is needed to explore longitudinal impacts of these reforms and expand comparative analyses with other nations implementing similar policies.

                Background In this paper, we explore the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras within a PUP (pseudo-UP)algebra X. We investigate how fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals are affected under PUP homomorphisms, particularly focusing on the image and inverse image of the fuzzy sets K α and K v , which generalize classical fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets aim to quantify the level of ambiguity in fuzzy situations. Methods We introduced the concept of the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals and subalgebras of PUP algebra and analyzed their properties. Specifically, we studied the behavior of fuzzy pseudo-UP ideals under PUP homomorphism, using the fuzzy sets K α and K v to model ambiguity. We also examined the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra and ideal of PUP algebra. Results We proved that the Cartesian product of fuzzy PUP ideals forms a fuzzy pseudo-UP ideal. This result was characterized through its level sets, providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between fuzzy PUP ideals and their algebraic structure. Additionally, the strongest fuzzy PUP relation on a fuzzy PUP subalgebra was defined, and several important properties were derived. Conclusions This work extends the concept of fuzzy PUP ideals in the context of PUP algebras and explores how fuzzy homomorphism influence their structure. Our results contribute to a better understanding of fuzzy relations in algebraic settings and open the door for further research into the properties and applications of fuzzy ideals in PUP algebras.

                Background Cataracts are an assortment of conditions causing the lens to become opaque and lose its typical transparency. Topical corticosteroids like loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone are commonly administered to alleviate inflammation following cataract surgery. Aim of the study To compare the efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone in managing different clinical parameters following cataract removal, as well as their patient safety. Methods This trial was registered by local IRB at the College of Medicine/University of Baghdad on November 27, 2023, under document approval number UoB.Med.21. Patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: group A received loteprednol etabonate 0.5% drop postoperatively for four weeks, while group B received dexamethasone 0.1% drop postoperatively for the same period. The levels of intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber (AC) reaction, and scores for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain were monitored at one and four weeks during follow-up visits. Results The visual outcomes were similar between the two groups, and both treatments were well tolerated with minor side effects. Both loteprednol etabonate and dexamethasone effectively reduced IOP, AC reaction, and grading for flare, conjunctival congestion, and pain in cataract patients. None of these clinical measures displayed any significant differences between the two drugs. Conclusion There is no significant difference between topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and topical dexamethasone 0.1% pertaining to clinical ocular parameters post-cataract surgery. The decision between these corticosteroids may depend on patient needs and preferences.

                Abstract* Financial literacy is one of the most important skills that people need in the 21st century, especially the youngest, as is the case with college students and mastering personal finance skills. This topic has gained importance in recent years in the field of scientific research. The objective of this study was to identify the most relevant factors related to financial education among young university students. A systematic literature review was developed based on the parameters established by the PRISMA statement. A total of 44 datasets were analyzed to identify the most recurring factors in the literature. Finally, the validity of the most relevant issues pertaining to the subject of study were identified. Thus, two themes were evident that are still valid and the most frequent in the literature on financial literacy among university students: financial behavior and financial knowledge. It is concluded that financial Inclusion, Budgeting, Financial Attitude, and Adolescents are other topics with a promising future in future research. The results of this study provide a structured guide for future research and help to identify research gaps that can be addressed in future studies.

                Background Adequate housing is a fundamental human need, yet in Egypt and the MENA region, they face challenges due to rising population pressures and economic difficulties. Affordable options are increasingly scarce, especially for those unable to meet housing market rates. This research explores micro-apartments as an eco-friendly solution aligned with global trends toward minimalism, offering compact living spaces of about 40 square meters. In Alexandria, where awareness is limited and energy consumption is high, the study emphasizes micro-apartments as a housing solution with the aim to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency for the occupants using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and passive design strategies. Methods This research evaluates micro-apartments as affordable housing in Egypt, emphasizing passive design and RT24HC Phase Change Material for wall insulation in Alexandria. A prototype is developed, and Design Builder software, using version 7.0.2.006 & Energy Plus 9.4 plugin, simulates the chosen RT24HC PCM’s energy efficiency. This methodology optimizes land use and enhances thermal comfort by integrating PCM with passive design, assessing Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%) and Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Results The results indicate that integrating the chosen Phase Change Material with passive design significantly lowers discomfort levels in micro-apartments. Four scenarios tested included: two layers of RT24HC PCM, one layer of RT24HC PCM with XPS insulation, two RT24HC PCM layers with window shading, and two RT24HC PCM layers with 1-meter overhang. The fourth scenario, achieving a 14.18% reduction in predicted discomfort (PPD%) and a Predicted Mean Vote of 1.3, highlights the potential of micro-apartments as an energy-efficient housing through effective PCM integration. Conclusion This study advocates for micro-apartment designs using RT24HC PCM tailored to Alexandria’s climate in Egypt to improve thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption. It provides insights for architects, developers, and policymakers in Egypt, highlighting the importance of PCM in sustainable urban housing solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-940/v2?src=rss">Integration of democratic values in natural sciences education: A Literature Review of the last 50 Years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background Research integrity, essential for ethical scientific research, has been inadequately addressed in Ethiopia, resulting in gaps in addressing misconduct like plagiarism, falsification and fabrication. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of researchers. Data were collected via a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was adapted from a similar study. The collected data were analysed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 244 researchers participated in the study, resulting in an 82% response rate. In our study, 37.7% of participants reported engaging in at least one form of misconduct, 95% CI [31.6%, 44.1%]. Authorship misconduct was the most common form of self-reported misconduct (47.5%), 95% CI [41.1%, 54.0%], followed by fabrication and falsification (40.6%), 95% CI [34.4%, 47.0%]. Publication pressure was significantly associated with research misconduct (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: [1.02, 9.95]). Conclusion Research misconduct has profound implications, compromising the validity of scientific findings and eroding public trust in research. Implementing comprehensive education initiatives on responsible research practices, as well as building an all-encompassing institutional policy, can help to reduce the occurrence of misconduct.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study of in vivo thrombus formation has principally been performed using intravital microscopy in mice and other species. These have allowed us to visualise the molecular and cellular processes that regulate thrombus formation inside the body. However current in vivo arterial thrombosis models are difficult to standardise between labs and frequently produce results that do not reliably translate successfully in human clinical trials. Here we provide a step-by-step description with accompanying video tutorials to demonstrate how to produce a 3D humanised thrombus-on-a-chip model, which uses perfusion of fluorescently-labelled human blood over a mechanically-injured human tissue engineered arterial construct (TEAC) within a 3D printed microfluidic flow chamber to replicate thrombus formation within a healthy artery. We also provide a written methodology on how to use 3D printing to produce a mechanical injury press that can reproducibly damage the TEAC as a stimulus for thrombus formation as part of a mechanical injury model. Perfusion of the uninjured TEAC with whole human blood containing DiOC6-labelled platelets without initiating notable thrombus formation. The mechanical injury press was shown to induce a reproducible puncture wound in the TEAC. Fluorescence microscopy was used to demonstrate that thrombus formation could be observed reproducibly around sites of injury. This humanised thrombosis-on-a-chip model can replace the use of animals in in vivo thrombosis models for preclinical assessment of anti-thrombotic therapies. This method also offers multiple scientific advantages: allowing new drugs to be directly tested on human blood from a diverse array of donors, facilitating use of a realistic and reproducible injury modality as well as removing the potential confounding effects of general anaesthetics in animal studies. The use of human thrombus-on-a-chip models combining TEACs offers a new methodology to reduce animal use whilst improving the predictive capabilities of preclinical trials of anti-thrombotic therapies.

                Background Stunting is a serious public health concern in Rwanda, affecting around 33.3% of children under five in 2020. The researchers have employed machine learning algorithms to predict stunting in Rwanda; however, few studies used ANNs, despite their strong capacity to predict stunting. The purpose of this study was to predict stunting in Rwanda using ANNs and the most recent DHS data from 2020. Methods DHS 2020 dataset was used to train and test an ANN model for predicting stunting in children. The dataset, which included various child, parental, and socio-demographic characteristics, was split into 80% training data and 20% testing and validation data. The model utilised a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Feature importances were determined and highlighted the most critical predictors of stunting. Results An overall accuracy of 72.0% on the test set was observed, with an AUC-ROC of 0.84, indicating the model’s good performance. Factors appear to contribute to stunting among the negative value aspects. First and foremost, the mother’s height is important, as a lower height suggests an increased risk of stunting in children. Positive value characteristics, on the other hand, emphasise elements that reduce the likelihood of stunting. The timing of the initiation of breastfeeding stands out as a crucial factor, showing that early breastfeeding initiation has been linked with a decreased risk of stunting. Conclusions These findings suggest that ANNs can be a useful tool for predicting stunting in Rwanda and identifying the most important associated factors for stunting. These insights can inform targeted interventions to reduce the burden of stunting in Rwanda and other low- and middle-income countries. Potential targeted interventions include nutritional support programs for pregnant and lactating mothers, and providing educational programs for parents on nutrition and hygiene.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Spain’s first Nobel laureate neuroscientist recognized as the founding father of modern neuroscience, is to be preserved in a new museum in Madrid: the National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN), one of the most important scientific research institutes in the country sciences in the scope of natural sciences of the Spanish National Research Council. For a boy who dreamed of being an artist but started his career apprenticed to first a barber and then a cobbler, Santiago Ramón y Cajal made a distinguished mark in science. One of Cajal’s most important contributions to our understanding of the brain was his discovery of the direction of the information flow within neurons and in neural circuits, which he called the “dynamic polarization law,” without a doubt the founding principle of neurosciences. The exposition planned by the MNCN is a perfect occasion to show the academy and, it is hoped, the general public at large the beautiful organization of the nervous system as first acknowledged by modern science. With the highly motivated organizers of this well-planned initiative, neuroscientists at the Cajal Institute are confident that this sample of the Cajal legacy will also be taken as an esthetic experience for those who approach it for the first time. It might be that science and art often go together.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss. Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to delineate synaptic density alterations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and explore its potential role as a biomarker for MSA diagnosis and disease severity monitoring using [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective study, 60 patients with MSA (30 patients with MSA-parkinsonian [MSA-P] subtype and 30 patients with MSA-cerebellar [MSA-C] subtype), 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET/CT for synaptic density assessment. Visual, voxel, and volumetric region of interest (VOI) analyses were used to elucidate synaptic density patterns in the MSA brain and establish diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performances of both visual and VOI-based diagnostics were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain synaptic density and disease severity</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MSA displayed extensive reductions in synaptic density throughout the brain, notably affecting both primary VOIs (the cerebellum and putamen) and secondary VOIs including the medulla oblongata, ventral tegmental area, and pons. Notably, patients with MSA-C exhibited a remarkable decrease in cerebellar synaptic density, whereas patients with MSA-P demonstrated significant synaptic loss within the posterior putamen. Compared with patients with PD, the patients with MSA show a more pronounced reduction in synaptic density in infratentorial brain regions. VOI-based diagnosis significantly outperformed visual analysis in diagnosing and differentiating MSA and its subtypes. Synaptic density in primary and multiple secondary VOIs correlated significantly with motor scales in patients with MSA.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study identified widespread synaptic density reductions in MSA, particularly in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region, suggesting [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating the disease, and guiding synaptic restoration trials.

                Glioma patients suffer devastating neurological complications. Using mouse models, the authors show that glioma induces neuronal mTOR activity, alters translation of synaptic genes, reduces dendritic spines and inhibitory synapses, and causes hyperexcitability and stimulus-evoked discharges. Inhibiting mTOR with AZD8055 reverses these effects and normalizes neuronal activity, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96724">A septo-hypothalamic-medullary circuit directs stress-induced analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a potent modulator of pain. Specifically, acute stress due to physical restraint induces stress-induced analgesia (SIA). However, where and how acute stress and pain pathways interface in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we describe how the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a forebrain limbic nucleus, facilitates SIA through its downstream targets in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of mice. Taking advantage of transsynaptic viral-genetic, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques, we show that the dLS→LHA circuitry is sufficient to drive analgesia and is required for SIA. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dLS→LHA pathway is opioid-dependent and modulates pain through the pro-nociceptive neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Remarkably, we found that the inhibitory dLS neurons are recruited specifically when the mice struggle to escape under restraint and, in turn, inhibit excitatory LHA neurons. As a result, the RVM neurons downstream of LHA are disengaged, thus suppressing nociception. Together, we delineate a poly-synaptic pathway that can transform escape behavior in mice under restraint to acute stress into analgesia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89506">Systematic evaluation of intratumoral and peripheral BCR repertoires in three cancers</a></h4>

              
                The current understanding of humoral immune response in cancer patients suggests that tumors may be infiltrated with diffuse B cells of extra-tumoral origin or may develop organized lymphoid structures, where somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection occur locally. These processes are believed to be significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment through secretory factors and biased cell-cell interactions. To explore the manifestation of this influence, we used deep unbiased immunoglobulin profiling and systematically characterized the relationships between B cells in circulation, draining lymph nodes (draining LNs), and tumors in 14 patients with three human cancers. We demonstrated that draining LNs are differentially involved in the interaction with the tumor site, and that significant heterogeneity exists even between different parts of a single lymph node (LN). Next, we confirmed and elaborated upon previous observations regarding intratumoral immunoglobulin heterogeneity. We identified B cell receptor (BCR) clonotypes that were expanded in tumors relative to draining LNs and blood and observed that these tumor-expanded clonotypes were less hypermutated than non-expanded (ubiquitous) clonotypes. Furthermore, we observed a shift in the properties of complementarity-determining region 3 of the BCR heavy chain (CDR-H3) towards less mature and less specific BCR repertoire in tumor-infiltrating B-cells compared to circulating B-cells, which may indicate less stringent control for antibody-producing B cell development in tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, we found repertoire-level evidence that B-cells may be selected according to their CDR-H3 physicochemical properties before they activate somatic hypermutation (SHM). Altogether, our work outlines a broad picture of the differences in the tumor BCR repertoire relative to non-tumor tissues and points to the unexpected features of the SHM process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97438">Sir2 and Fun30 regulate ribosomal DNA replication timing via MCM helicase positioning and nucleosome occupancy</a></h4>

              
                The association between late replication timing and low transcription rates in eukaryotic heterochromatin is well known, yet the specific mechanisms underlying this link remain uncertain. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for both transcriptional silencing and late replication at the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays. We have previously reported that in the absence of <i>SIR2</i>, a de-repressed RNA PolII repositions MCM replicative helicases from their loading site at the ribosomal origin, where they abut well-positioned, high-occupancy nucleosomes, to an adjacent region with lower nucleosome occupancy. By developing a method that can distinguish activation of closely spaced MCM complexes, here we show that the displaced MCMs at rDNA origins have increased firing propensity compared to the nondisplaced MCMs. Furthermore, we found that both activation of the repositioned MCMs and low occupancy of the adjacent nucleosomes critically depend on the chromatin remodeling activity of <i>FUN30</i>. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Sir2 delays replication timing, and it demonstrates, for the first time, that activation of a specific replication origin in vivo relies on the nucleosome context shaped by a single chromatin remodeler.

	<p>Background/Objectives: We examined the effects of cardiovascular exercise on verbal fluency using a between-groups design. Methods: Within our experimental (i.e., exercise) group, participants performed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks (VFTs) before, during, and after a vigorous 30 min bout of cycling. Participants within our control group also completed these VFTs before, during, and after a non-physical activity. We compared the VFT performance of the experimental (exercise) and control (no-exercise) groups of participants in terms of the characteristics of the words that they produced within the VFTs. In addition, we examined these aspects of VFT performance for each participant group across time within the experiment session. Conclusions: From these comparisons, we see that exercise influenced VFT performance. Most notably, participants engaged in exercise changed their VFT performance over time, while control group participants did not. Exercising participants produced more words over the course of their exercise session that contained fewer letters over time and were lower in frequency during and after exercise as compared to before exercise. Additionally, topic switches in the VFTs increased after exercise as compared to before exercise. Participants in the control group did not change their VFT performance over time according to any of these measures. These findings indicate that exercise impacted participants&amp;amp;rsquo; lexical access and that these VFT performance changes were not due to practice effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents a widely prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition in pediatric populations, often exhibiting a substantial propensity to persist into adulthood. ADHD is a multifaceted disorder that resists straightforward diagnostic tests. Clinicians must invest substantial time and effort to secure an accurate diagnosis and implement effective treatment. ADHD diagnosis is primarily based on psychiatric tests, as there is currently no clinically utilized objective diagnostic tool. Nonetheless, several studies in have documented endeavors to create objective instruments designed to assist in the diagnostic process of ADHD, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce subjectivity. Method: This research endeavor sought to establish an objective diagnostic modality for ADHD through the utilization of electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. With the use of innovative deep learning techniques, this research seeks to improve the diagnosis of ADHD using EEG data. To capture complex patterns in EEG data, this study proposes a double-augmented attention mechanism ResNet-based model. Using an autoencoder for feature extraction, the Reptile Search Algorithm for feature selection, and a modified ResNet architecture for model training comprise the technique. Results: AUC, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, and other standard classifiers like Random Forest and AdaBoost were utilized to compare the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. By a wide margin, the proposed ResNet model outperforms the traditional models with a 99.42% accuracy, 99.03% precision, 99.82% recall, and 99.42% F1-score. Conclusions: ROC AUC score of 0.99 for the model underscores its remarkable capability to differentiate between children with and without ADHD, thereby minimizing misclassification errors and improving diagnostic precision.</p>

	<p>This case study examined the process of integration of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and sensorimotor psychotherapy (SP) in three-phase trauma treatment with a 32-year-old female Bengali refugee with Complex Post Traumatic Disorder (C-PTSD). The treatment was provided in a Western country. The client&amp;amp;rsquo;s improvement was assessed by using self-report assessments of post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Psychodiagnostics&amp;amp;rsquo; scores gathered after 2 years of treatment showed significant improvements in post-traumatic, dissociative, and depressive symptoms. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limitations of this study, results suggest that integrating CBT and SP in a phase-trauma approach may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting. However, replicating and standardizing such preliminary results on larger samples is necessary. Background/Objectives: SP is an innovative psychotherapeutic intervention aimed at treating trauma through a bottom-up approach, however, little research exists regarding the efficacy of this psychotherapy. This case study aims to investigate the efficacy of the combination of CBT and SP in treating a C-PTSD patient in a transcultural setting. Methods: Three questionnaires were administered to investigate post-traumatic, depressive, and dissociative symptoms. Results: Clinical and psychodiagnostic outcomes highlight significant psychological improvements in the patient. Conclusions: Although any firm conclusion cannot be drawn because of various intrinsic limitations (i.e., single case study) that straiten our ability to extend these results, this case study suggests that the integration of CBT and SP may be an effective treatment for C-PTSD in a transcultural setting.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In a tonal language like Chinese, phonologically contrasting tones signify word meanings at the syllable level. Although the development of lexical tone perception ability has been examined in many behavioral studies, its developmental trajectory from childhood to adulthood at the neural level remains unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the issue by measuring the mismatch negativity (MMN) response to a Chinese lexical tonal contrast in three groups. Methods: The MMN response to a flat-falling tonal contrast (Tone1 versus Tone4) were recorded from children (25 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;8), adolescents (26 participants aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;14), and young adults (20 participants aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;24). Nonsense speech stimuli were also used by superimposing Tone1 and Tone4 on an English syllable. Results: All three groups demonstrated typical early MMN responses in both the meaningful and nonsense syllable conditions. However, the MMN amplitudes varied significantly across groups, with the child group showing smaller responses compared to the adolescent and adult groups, while the latter two groups had similar MMN amplitudes. Conclusions: Neural sensitivity to tonal contrasts is not fully mature in children and reaches a more adult-like level during adolescence, with no significant difference in sensitivity to meaningful versus nonsense syllables. These results provide new insights into the neural development of lexical tone perception in a tonal language, highlighting its maturation during adolescence in this process.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies, for example, on taste-visual dissonance, have shown that the influence of the visual cortex on taste sensation is enormous. The presented work aims to investigate, using fNIRS, whether a taste stimulus, in this case, the taste of bitter, also causes stimulation of the visual cortex in the fNIRS study. Methods: fNIRS was used to examine 51 participants (204 examinations, 9996 records), collecting signals from the left hemisphere. Differences between the maximum and minimum changes in oxyHb concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb) for the areas of the brain cortex considered responsible for recording visual and gustatory signals were analyzed. Protocols I, II, III, and IV&amp;amp;mdash;activation with distillate water, coffee with lower concentration, reference (no stimulation), and coffee with higher concentration, respectively, were used. Results: We recorded high signals for teste activation on channels covering the gustatory cortex, which confirms the correctness of the choice of research method. As expected, a significant statistical difference was observed between protocols I, II, and IV and reference III (without stimulation). What seems important is the fact that we also received high signals for the channels 45&amp;amp;ndash;49, which cover the visual cortex. The statistical analysis shows no differences between protocols I, II, and IV (different taste activation&amp;amp;mdash;water, coffee A, and coffee B) for specific channels for analyzing regions of interest. As a result of the analysis of the correlation between the subjective bitterness assessment solutions and the signal &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb height, it was observed that a statistically significant correlation, although weak, occurs only for 14 and gustatory channels, only for coffee with a higher concentration. Additionally, the only statistically significant difference between women and men was observed in Protocol I (water), where the &amp;amp;Delta;oxyHb signal was twice as high in women compared to men. Conclusions: In conclusion, we can clearly state that the senses of sight and taste work closely together. Moreover, this cooperation is not one-sided: while visual activation influences taste perception, interestingly, a taste stimulus can also generate a hemodynamic response, activating the visual cortex.</p>

	<p>Background: Perfectionism in adolescents can have both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with implications for mental health and school performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation in adolescents and to evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational interventions. Methods: Two studies were conducted: (1) A cross-sectional study (n = 261) examined the correlations among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation. (2) An experimental study (n = 115) evaluated the effects of psychoeducation on perfectionism and healthy habits compared with a control group. The measures included questionnaires on perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation. Results: Study 1 found that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.52, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), stress (r = 0.45, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and difficulties in emotional regulation (r = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Adaptive perfectionism was negatively correlated with deficits in emotional understanding (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Study 2 showed that psychoeducational interventions reduced maladaptive perfectionism (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;5.7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.62) and depression levels (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;3.2, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.38) but increased stress in the experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in adaptive perfectionism or the anxiety level. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex relationships among perfectionism, mental health, and emotional regulation in adolescents. Targeted interventions can reduce maladaptive perfectionism and its associated negative effects. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes and refinement of interventional strategies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>The long-term clinical outcomes and associated prognostic factors in contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)-antibody diseases are unknown. A total of 75 participants with CASPR2 antibodies were longitudinally assessed for disability, quality-of-life, and chronic pain. Although most symptoms improved within 6 months of treatment, neuropathic pain and fatigue were the most immunotherapy refractory, and persisted for up to 6 years. Furthermore, these two factors—but not CASPR2 antibody levels or subclasses—independently predicted worse disability and quality-of-life at 24 months. Quality-of-life varied widely for any given modified Rankin Scale score, indicating a divergence between patient and clinician assessed outcomes. Further work should study the relative importance of these measures, and the immunopathogenesis underlying intractable symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Neuropeptides belonging to the cholecystokinin/sulfakinin (CCK/SK) family mediate satiety signals across phylogeny. In this study, a potential anatomical substrate for such satiety signals was described in the snail <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>. We propose that CCK/SK signals directly modulate gustatory sensory neurons that project from the lips to the brain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snails belonging to the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i> serve as obligatory intermediate hosts for the trematode <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, the causative agent for the most widespread form of schistosomiasis. The simpler nervous systems of gastropod molluscs, such as <i>Biomphalaria</i>, provide advantageous models for investigating neural responses to infection at the cellular and network levels. The present study examined neuropeptides related to cholecystokinin (CCK), a major multifunctional regulator of central nervous system (CNS) function in mammals. A neural transcriptome generated from the CNS of <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> included a transcript encoding two CCK-related peptides, designated <i>Balex</i>-CCK1 (pEGEWSYDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GLGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Balex</i>-CCK2 (NYGDY<sub>(SO</sub>
<sub>3</sub>
<sub>H)</sub>GIGGGRF-NH<sub>2</sub>). Peptide expression was examined in <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> at the mRNA level using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) protocol and at the protein level using an antibody against <i>Balex</i>-CCK1. Expression was detected in 60–70 neurons distributed throughout the CNS, as well as in profuse fiber systems connecting the ganglia and projecting to the periphery. CCK-like immunoreactive (CCK<sub>li</sub>) fibers were also observed on organs associated with the cardiorespiratory (nephridium, mantle, gill) and male reproductive systems. A comparison of mRNA and peptide localization suggested that CCK expression could be regulated at the level of translation. A potential role of these peptides in mediating responses to infection by larval schistosomes is discussed.</p>

                Xu et al. investigated the single-cell characteristics of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis and found that the pro-metastatic neutrophil cluster is enriched at the metastatic border. NFE2-driven neutrophil phenotypic polarization represents a critical pro-metastatic mechanism. TGF-β/SMAD3 activates NFE2, further promoting NET release at the invasive front by transcriptional regulation of PADI4.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sexual minority older adults (SMOAs) report greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than heterosexual older adults (HOAs). This study aimed to compare the impact of multiple psycho-social risk factors on objective and subjective cognitive decline in HOAs and SMOAs. Methods: Two samples of self-identified HOAs and SMOAs were selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Reliable change indices for episodic and semantic memory were created to assess cognitive decline. SCD was self-reported for memory and general cognition. Depressive symptoms, loneliness, marital status and socio-economic status were investigated as risk factors. Results: No between-group differences were found in cognitive decline. Higher depression was associated with greater SCD risk and worse semantic memory decline. The latter effect was stronger in SMOAs. The findings were largely replicated in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Poor mental health may represent the strongest driver of cognitive decline in SMOAs and to a greater extent than in HOAs.</p>

	<p>Background: Tramadol (TRA) is an opioid that is used to manage moderate to severe pain. Long-term use of TRA can lead to the development of opioid use disorder. Objectives: This study investigates the role of forced exercise in reducing TRA-seeking behavior. Methods: Adult male rats (240&amp;amp;ndash;260 g) were divided into five groups; the control group received vehicle injections, the TRA group received TRA (75 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 8 days, and three TRA&amp;amp;ndash;exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to conditioning with TRA. A tramadol-conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure assessed TRA reinforcement, after which all rats were euthanized, tissue extracted, and mRNA expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1&amp;amp;beta;) determined in hippocampus (Hipp), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Results: TRA-seeking behavior was seen in the TRA group and the 6 weeks forced exercise group. By contrast, forced exercise for 2 or 4 weeks attenuated TRA-seeking behavior. This attenuation was associated with a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA expression in the Hipp and NAc, but not the PFC. Additionally, the TRA-induced elevations in Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression were reversed by all durations of exercise in Hipp. However, only 2 and 4 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exercise reduced elevations in PFC and NAc Il-1&amp;amp;beta; expression. Conclusion: Forced exercise for 2 and 4 weeks attenuates TRA-seeking behavior partially through the regulation of Bdnf and Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression.</p>

                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-103/v1?src=rss">Development and validation of the HEALTH scoring system = A novel and non-invasive laboratory panel to differentiate intestinal tuberculosis from   other gastrointestinal diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.
