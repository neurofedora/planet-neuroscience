                arXiv:2507.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks.

                arXiv:2507.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preclinical models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions often rely on inbred mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6), which exhibit limited genetic and behavioral variability. This limitation hampers the modeling of phenotypic heterogeneity, characteristic of these conditions. Recent efforts have explored the use of multiple genetically diverse hybrid strains to address this. In this study, we examined whether one single mixed genetic mouse background, C57BL/6J;129S2/SvPas (B6;129), could simultaneously recapitulate behavioral variability and display improved phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Compared to the inbred B6 strain, mixed B6;129 mice displayed enhanced sociability and self-grooming, two key discriminating parameters between the two mouse backgrounds and core features of such conditions, alongside a broader spectrum of individual behavioral variability. Although overall behavioral variability was comparable across backgrounds, B6;129 mice were less susceptible to the effects of chronic social isolation than their B6 counterparts.  Together, these findings support that the B6;129 mixed background offers a more representative model of individual variability and behavioral traits associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, thereby enhancing its translational relevance in preclinical studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19416">Dual Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Responses of Inspiratory Neurons to Noradrenergic Modulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiration is an essential involuntary function necessary for survival. This poses a challenge for the control of breathing. The preB\"otzinger complex (preB\"otC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network responsible for driving the inspiratory rhythm. While neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) allow it to be both robust and flexible for all living beings to interact with their environment, the basis for how neuromodulation impacts neuron-specific properties remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine how NE influences different preB\"otC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects through modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic current gating conductance ($g_{\rm CAN}$) and inositol-triphosphate ($\rm IP_3$), guided by experimental studies. Our computational model captures the experimentally observed differential effects of NE on distinct preB\"otC bursting patterns. We show that this dual mechanism is critical for inducing conditional bursting and identify specific parameter regimes where silent neurons remain inactive in the presence of NE. Furthermore, using methods of dynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially modulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent bursting neurons. These results align well with previously reported experimental findings and provide a deeper understanding of cell-specific neuromodulatory responses within the respiratory network.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945">The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.02945v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.

                arXiv:2502.11395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived fragment C99 has emerged as a central driver of subcellular dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet its precise interactome and contribution to mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal disruption remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed quantitative proteomic mapping of C99 associated proteins in a Drosophila AD model and identified three major functional modules nuclear gene expression, mitochondrial metabolism, and autophagy regulation frequently disrupted in AD. Among these, several C99 interactors showed altered association upon treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a metabolic ketone body with emerging neuroprotective properties. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that C99 expression induced severe mitochondrial fragmentation, cristae loss, and the accumulation of dense vesicles with fibrillar contents, indicative of impaired organelle integrity and degradative failure. These abnormalities were substantially reversed by BHB treatment, which restored mitochondrial architecture, improved lysosomal acidification, and reduced the burden of aberrant vesicles. Functional assays confirmed that BHB also rescued lifespan and memory deficits in C99-expressing flies. Further, expression of selected C99 interactors such as PPME1 and VPS35 was sufficient to ameliorate neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo, underscoring their functional relevance. Together, our findings define a multi-axis cellular pathology driven by C99 accumulation and demonstrate that metabolic intervention via BHB can reprogram disrupted proteomic networks and organelle homeostasis. These results establish a mechanistic link between ketone signaling and early subcellular dysfunction in AD, offering potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17382">Unraveling the geometry of visual relational reasoning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing "constant" in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle, limiting their flexible reasoning. To investigate mechanisms underlying such generalization, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematically evaluating abstract relational reasoning, addressing limitations in prior datasets. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to quantify relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four models, ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL), we find that SCL generalizes best and most closely aligns with human behavior. Using a geometric approach, we identify key representation properties that accurately predict generalization and uncover a fundamental trade-off between signal and dimensionality: novel relations compress into training-induced subspaces. Layer-wise analysis reveals where relational structure emerges, highlights bottlenecks, and generates concrete hypotheses about abstract reasoning in the brain. Motivated by these insights, we propose SNRloss, a novel objective explicitly balancing representation geometry. Our results establish a geometric foundation for relational reasoning, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI and opening promising avenues for extending geometric analysis to broader cognitive tasks.

                arXiv:2507.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

                arXiv:2507.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information from prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One core innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder, which leverages common representational structure across subjects while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain activity prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/Angelneer926/Algonauts_challenge.

                arXiv:2507.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our "gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active. This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning, and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18681">Concept Probing: Where to Find Human-Defined Concepts (Extended Version)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing, additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models and datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18868">A Neuroscience-Inspired Dual-Process Model of Compositional Generalization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC "System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas, storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99% accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067">PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256">Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRT-7FBFUYT4E.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17844">LeanKAN: A Parameter-Lean Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Layer with Improved Memory Efficiency and Convergence Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is a promising alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for data-driven modeling. While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across a standard KAN toy problem as well as ordinary and partial differential equations learned via KAN-ODEs, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.

                arXiv:2506.19037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.

">NG2-Glia Heterogeneity Across Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                NG2-glia are a unique and heterogeneous glial cell population with diverse roles in the central nervous system. However, their morphological diversity across brain regions and cortical layers remains poorly understood. Here, we use StarTrack labeling and in utero electroporation at embryonic day 14 (E14) to reconstruct individual NG2-glial cells in the adult mouse cortex and corpus callosum. Through detailed two- and three-dimensional morphometric analyses, including Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering, we uncover striking layer-specific patterns. NG2-glia in deep cortical layers (L5-6) exhibit significantly larger somatic areas, more elaborate arborizations, and higher process complexity compared to those in superficial layers (L1-4) and the corpus callosum. In contrast, NG2-glia in layer 1 and the corpus callosum share a compact morphology characterized by smaller somata and simplified processes, suggesting common microenvironmental constraints. Moreover, Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering reveal distinct morphological subpopulations within the NG2-glial population and highlight heterogeneity in upper cortical layers. Comparative analyses with astrocytes reveal fundamental structural differences: NG2-glia have thinner, longer processes and larger enclosing radii but occupy smaller volumes, whereas astrocytes form denser, more compact arbors with higher branch numbers. Together, our finding establish the first comprehensive morphological atlas of cortical adult NG2-glia, highlighting region- and layer-specific adaptations that likely underlie their diverse roles in CNS physiology and repair.

">Sex-specific hypothalamic axis disruption in the rNLS8 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</a></h4>

              
                Sex-related differences have gained increasing attention in recent years due to evidence of varying prevalence, pathophysiology, survival rates, and disease progression between males and females in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Differences in brain metabolism between sexes in ALS patients have also been reported; however, the specific molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. As growing evidence supports a strong metabolic component in ALS, this study investigates alterations in leptin, one of the key regulators of metabolism, that is known to be altered during ALS progression in rNLS8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of ALS which closely recapitulates the TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology observed in most patients with ALS. We also examined changes in hypothalamic neuronal genes involved in metabolic regulation through food intake in rNLS8 mice. Additionally, pathological alterations in the spinal cord, a primary site of ALS pathology, were also assessed. Using molecular biology techniques we analysed the expression levels of leptin, its long receptor (Ob-Rb), and its downstream signaling pathways (Akt and STAT3) in rNLS8 mice compared to age- and sex-matched wild-type littermates. Our results revealed significant sex- and disease stage-dependent differences in leptin and Ob-Rb expression in white adipose tissue and the hypothalamus, along with increased activation of the Akt signaling pathway in the spinal cord of rNLS8 mice. These findings suggest that ALS progression differs by sex in rNLS8 mice, which may impact overall disease progression and the effectiveness of potential therapeutic interventions targeting metabolism, such as nutritional strategies that influence leptin levels.

">The Alzheimer's therapeutic Lecanemab induces an amyloid-clearing program in microglia</a></h4>

              
                Controversies over anti-amyloid immunotherapies underscore the need to elucidate their mechanisms of action. Here we demonstrate that Lecanemab, a leading anti-A{beta} antibody, mediates amyloid clearance by triggering effector functions in the microglia. Using a human microglia xenograft model, we show that Lecanemab significantly reduces A{beta} pathology and associated neuritic damage, while neither Fc-inactivated Lecanemab nor microglia deficiency elicit this effect despite intact plaque binding. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses reveal that Lecanemab induces a focused transcriptional program that enhances phagocytosis, lysosomal degradation, metabolic reprogramming, interferon gamma genes, and antigen presentation. Finally, we identify SPP1/osteopontin as a major factor induced by Lecanemab treatment and demonstrate its role in promoting A{beta} clearance. These findings highlight that effective amyloid removal depends on the engagement of microglia through Fc fragment, providing critical insights for optimizing anti-amyloid therapies in AD.

">Paraquat Licences α-Synuclein to Trigger NLRP3-Dependent Pyroptosis in Microglia</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration and the pathological accumulation of -synuclein (Syn) aggregates. While its etiology is multifactorial, environmental toxicants such as paraquat, a widely used herbicide banned in over 70 countries but still permitted in some regions, including Australia, are strongly implicated. We previously showed that Syn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, inducing interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) release without triggering pyroptosis. Here, we examine how paraquat modulates microglial NLRP3 activation by Syn. Using primary microglia from wild-type (WT) and Nlrp3 knockout (Nlrp3 KO) mice, alongside human monocyte-derived microglia, we demonstrate that paraquat induces dose-dependent NLRP3 activation in LPS-primed WT microglia via NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This results in ASC speck formation and IL-1{beta} release, which is absent in Nlrp3 KO microglia and blocked by the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. While Syn alone fails to induce pyroptosis, co-treatment with paraquat resulted in caspase-1-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and gasdermin-D cleavage, hallmarks of pyroptotic cell death. This response was also suppressed by NLRP3 inhibition. Our findings reveal that paraquat acts as a critical second hit to license Syn-induced inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis in microglia, highlighting a mechanistic link between environmental toxin exposure and innate immune activation in PD pathogenesis. Targeting this axis with brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitors may offer an alternative therapeutic avenue for synucleinopathies associated with environmental toxins.

">Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS) enhances motor cortex plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neural excitability fluctuates with sensory events, creating windows of opportunity to enhance brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), including intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), is a promising treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, but does not account for fluctuations in neural excitability, likely contributing to variable outcomes. Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS) leverages sensorimotor oscillations to enhance corticospinal responses, but the sustained effects as a repetitive protocol are unknown. We extend seTMS to iTBS, measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as a physiological readout. In a randomized crossover study comparing standard iTBS with sensory entrained iTBS (se-iTBS; n=20), we found that se-iTBS more than doubled the MEP effect (55% vs 26% MEP enhancement) and persisted for at least 30 minutes. Notably, at least 80% of participants showed larger responses with se-iTBS at all time points. se-iTBS may provide a robust and practical framework for optimizing TMS that bridges electrophysiological mechanisms and clinical applications.

">High speed functional imaging with a microfluidics-compatible open-top light-sheet microscope enabled by model predictive control of a tunable lens</a></h4>

              
                Functional fluorescence imaging of small, transparent organisms has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the development and function of intact nervous systems at the cellular level, particularly when combined with microfluidic tools that enable precise manipulation of sensory cues. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has a number of advantages for functional imaging, including efficient axial sectioning, reduced photobleaching, and high speed compared to confocal methods, but many configurations with ideal properties for efficient functional imaging place constraints on sample access and geometry that preclude their use with microfluidics. We present an open-top light-sheet microscope that uses a simplified inverted water immersion interface coupled with tunable lens remote focusing to achieve high-speed, multichannel 3D imaging of specimens in conventional microfluidics. We use model predictive control to efficiently optimize drive signals for an electrically tunable lens, providing reliable, camera-limited scanning of the imaging volume. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by recording calcium activity from C. elegans at volume rates up to 20 Hz, including both whole-brain response to chemical stimulation and compartmentalized dendritic response of the PVD neuron to mechanical stimulation. Our approaches are flexible and inexpensive to implement, and could be adapted to improve performance and sample compatibility for a wide range of imaging techniques.

">TWITCHES DURING N2 AND N3 ARE COUPLED WITH SLEEP SPINDLES BUT NOT DELTA OSCILLATIONS IN 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS</a></h4>

              
                Twitches are discrete movements that characterize REM sleep. However, recent work showed that twitches also occur during NREM sleep in human infants beginning around 3 months of age, a time when sleep spindles and the cortical delta rhythm are also emerging. Further, NREM twitches co-occur with sleep spindles, suggesting a unique functional role. Given that NREM sleep is composed of distinct substages, we investigated whether twitching and twitch-spindle coupling are differentially expressed during N2 and N3 sleep. In 6-month-old human infants (n=21; 7 females), we recorded EEG, respiration, and video during daytime sleep. We found that the high intensity of twitching during N2 resembled REM more than N3. In contrast, sleep spindles exhibited similar temporal characteristics during N2 and N3. Also, despite differences in the intensity of twitching during N2 and N3, significant twitch-spindle coupling occurred in both stages. Finally, twitch rate was inversely related to delta power across NREM periods. These findings suggest that although twitching occurs during REM, N2, and N3 sleep at this age, its expression is compatible with some sleep components (e.g., rapid eye movements, sleep spindles) but not others (e.g., cortical delta), highlighting the continuing need to better understand the dynamic organization of sleep and its individual components in early development.

">Continuous partitioning of neuronal variability</a></h4>

              
                Neural variability poses a major challenge to understanding the information content of neural codes. Recent work by Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) has provided new insights into variability in the visual pathway by partitioning it into two components: a stimulus component reflecting sensory tuning, and a modulatory component arising from stimulus-independent fluctuations in excitability. However, a key limitation of this framework is that it lacks a continuous-time interpretation; it applies only to spike counts measured in time bins of a given size, and does not generalize to different bin sizes. Here we overcome this limitation using a new model for continuous-time partitioning of neural variability, the "continuous modulated Poisson'' (CMP). This model extends the partitioning model of Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) by modeling a neuron's instantaneous firing rate as the product of a time-varying stimulus drive and a continuous-time stochastic gain process. We apply this model to spike responses from four different visual areas (LGN, V1, V2, and MT) and show that it accurately captures spike train variability across timescales and throughout the visual hierarchy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the modulatory gain process decays according to an exponentiated power law, with higher variance and slower decay at later stages of the visual hierarchy. This model provides new insights into the organization of both stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent modulatory processes and provides a powerful framework for characterizing neural variability across brain regions.

">HBMAP: Bayesian inference of neural circuits from DNAbarcoded projection mapping</a></h4>

              
                Decoding how the brain routes information through its precise, long-range wiring remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Barcode-based mapping of axonal projections allows brain-wide, high-throughput investigation of projections at single-neuron resolution offering a powerful solution. However, principled methods for statistical analysis of barcode count data that can detect common projection rules and effectively integrate datasets across subjects are lacking. To address these issues, we developed a model-based clustering approach through hierarchical Bayesian mixtures which we call hierarchical Bayesian mapping of axonal projections (HBMAP). We show that the inferred model accurately reflects the features of the data and allows simultaneous identification of projection patterns and characterization of uncertainty that accounts for subject variability. Our study presents the first Bayesian approach to barcode-based projection mapping, offering a general solution for this class of data.

">Cognitive training effects are shaped more by individual brain dynamics than age - Evidence from younger and older women</a></h4>

              
                Given the well-established structural and functional changes in the aging brain, it is widely assumed that cognitive aging is primarily driven by robust group-level differences between young and older adults. However, our individual-level EEG functional connectivity analysis challenges this notion. We investigated the impact of cognitive training on functional brain connectivity using task-switching paradigms in 39 younger (18-25 years) and 40 older (60-75 years) women. Participants were randomly assigned to either a training group, which completed eight individualized one-hour cognitive training sessions, or a no-contact control group. EEG was recorded at both pre- and post-training sessions across three task-switching paradigms (trained and near-transfer versions). Unique functional connectivity of different sources of variation was examined by calculating how much variance was shared across stable traits (e.g., individual, age, and common factors), or dynamic states (e.g., task and training effects). Our results revealed that age accounted for only a modest proportion of variance, whereas self-similarity was a dominant factor - particularly in older adults. Similarly, group-level training effects were small but strongly modulated by individual neural profiles, suggesting person-specific trajectories. Participants recruited distinct neural networks across tasks, and even within the same task engaged unique, individual-specific network configurations, reflecting personalised brain adaptations to cognitive demands. Importantly, older adults displayed a shift from common to individual network patterns, consistent with increased neural specialization and compensatory mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of moving beyond group-level contrasts toward models that capture the complexity of individual brain dynamics in cognitive aging and training responsiveness.

">Functional analysis of ligand-gated chloride channels in a cnidarian sheds light on the evolution of inhibitory signalling</a></h4>

              
                {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory transmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. Fast inhibitory signalling is mediated by type A GABA receptors (GABAARs), which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. While GABA is also present in plants and prokaryotes, it is unknown when it was first used for fast neuronal transmission. Cnidaria represent a sister group to all Bilateria and possess a variety of putative GABAARs, none of which has been functionally characterized. In this study, we surveyed putative inhibitory ion channel receptors from the model cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a surprising complexity of these receptors. The majority formed a cnidarian-specific radiation with some receptors forming a basal clade. We functionally analyzed seven putative Nematostella GABAARs of this radiation and found that none was activated by GABA or glycine, whereas three were activated by glutamate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a lysine residue in the canonical ligand-binding pocket that is important for activation by glutamate. Our results identified a group of inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria that uses glutamate as a ligand. Moreover, they suggest that inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria massively diversified, which may have been instrumental in the evolution of complex behaviors and sensory processing by the cnidarian nervous system. This work lays the foundation for understanding the diversity and evolution of inhibitory receptors in Cnidaria and the evolution of inhibitory signalling in animal nervous systems.

">Frontotemporal bursting supports human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neural activity varies dynamically during memory periods, when relevant information is not present in the environment. But how those dynamics are related to a code defining working memory (WM) performance is not known. Recent data shows brief bursts of activity in the high gamma (70-140 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) band within non-human primate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with WM processing. However, WM may be related to activity within a network of frontal executive and posterior sensory areas involved in stimulus perception. Here we tested whether gamma and beta bursting exist in lateral PFC and multisensory lateral temporal areas in humans during visual WM, and whether these areas are coupled via a phase-burst code. We used intracranial macroelectrode recordings from the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), which includes dorsolateral PFC, and from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), an area important for visual processing. High gamma bursting increased in human left PFC during encoding and delay periods while beta bursting decreased. Interestingly, beta bursting increased in multisensory areas during encoding and remained high during the delay period, more so on the right. These effects varied with WM performance. Finally, we quantify the degree to which delay-period gamma bursting is locked to beta phase within and between regions of this network using a proposed metric termed phase-burst coupling (PBC). We find evidence that delay-period gamma bursting in temporal areas is locked to beta phase in PFC. Our findings suggest that WM may use bursting to support memory maintenance until readout.

">Visual Word Form Area demonstrates individual and task-agnostic consistency but inter-individual variability</a></h4>

              
                Ventral Occipital Temporal Cortex (VOTC) is home to a mosaic of categorically-selective functional regions that respond to visual stimuli. Within left VOTC lies the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) - a text-selective region that develops as an individual learns to read. While there is consistency in the general location of text-selective responses - within the posterior portion of the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS) - there is also substantial variability across individuals in the size and precise anatomical location. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate over the extent to which the VWFA a) encodes the visual features of text, versus b) is driven by the task of reading. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned adults and children as they completed two tasks while viewing text, pseudo fonts, faces, objects, limbs. Experimental tasks were: (1) a fixation task where they were instructed to ignore the stimuli while making psychophysical judgements on the fixation dot; (2) a one-back task where they were instructed to attend to the stimuli and detect repeats. We found that a consistent VWFA location could be identified on each individual's cortical surface using either task. At the same time, the response to text during the one-back task evoked a larger territory of text-selective response (leading to a larger ROI) than the fixation task. However, when averaged in template space, text-selective cortex could not be identified due to variability in the relative locations of text-, face-, object-, and limb-selective cortex. Thus, for both children and adults, a text-selective region (i.e., VWFA) can be localized on the individual cortical surface. This resulting region consistently responds to text irrespective of cognitive task, but text-selective responses are masked when averaged in template space due to variability in the exact configuration of category-selective regions.

">Intrinsic noise reveals the stability of a neuronal network</a></h4>

              
                The stability of rhythmic activity in neural networks is an important aspect in the study of central pattern generators (CPGs). Different from other physiological rhythms, the activity of CPGs has not been fully characterized in terms of its stability, especially using quantitative methods. We propose a method that takes advantage of the natural noise present in CPGs to quantify the stability of the rhythmic activity. Furthermore, we used the stationary bootstrap method to define confidence intervals of the results. We applied this method to study the influence of a synaptic modification on the pyloric CPG circuit, using artificial synapses implemented in dynamic clamp software. We show that even after removing one of its strongest synapses, the CPG stability remains unaltered. This analysis suggests that CPGs are designed to be strongly stable regardless of the parameter perturbations they undergo.

">Amyloid precursor protein mediates deficits in corticogenesis in Down syndrome cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS), due to trisomy 21 (T21), occurs in approximately 14.14 per 10,000 live births in the United States. Reduced neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, delayed neurogenesis, impaired cortical lamination and altered cell fate specification are thought to contribute to cognitive impairments in DS individuals. The molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are not fully understood. Notably, Amyloid precursor protein (APP), located on human chromosome 21 (HSA21), has been extensively implicated in these processes. Mouse models only partially recapitulate DS phenotypes due to genetic, developmental, and species specific differences. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived 3D cortical organoids allow for the study of DS cortical development in a human model system. Here, we show that normalizing APP gene copy number in DS cortical organoids ameliorated deficits in NPC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and transcriptional programs. Our results demonstrate the value of cortical organoids in uncovering gene-specific roles in DS pathogenesis and identify APP as a promising target for addressing early neurodevelopmental impairments.

                Metabolism requires precise gene regulation to balance energy intake and expenditure for an organism's well-being, with misregulation often leading to metabolic syndromes. This study reveals that the brain-specific microRNA miR-1000 regulates fat storage by controlling the expression of a neuropeptide gene, Nplp1. Loss of miR-1000 increases Nplp1 expression, leading to higher body weight, increased fat storage, improved survival under food deprivation conditions, and a reduced overall lifespan in Drosophila. We further show that miR-1000 promotes fat storage upon feeding by regulating TAG synthesis and storage in lipid droplets, thereby playing a crucial role in metabolic regulation.

">Control of walking direction by descending and dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals need to fine-control the speed and direction of locomotion to navigate complex and dynamic environments. To achieve this, they integrate multimodal sensory inputs with their internal drive to constantly adjust their motor output. This integration involves the interplay of neuronal populations across different hierarchical levels along the sensorimotor axis - from sensory, central, and modulatory neurons in the brain to descending neurons and motor networks in the nerve cord. Here, we characterize two populations of neurons that control distinct aspects of walking on different hierarchical levels in Drosophila. First, we use in-vivo electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that moonwalker descending neurons (MDN) integrate antennal touch to drive changes in walking direction from forward to backward. Second, we establish DopaMeander as an important component in the control of forward walking through a combination of optogenetic activation, silencing, connectomics, and in-vivo recordings. These dopaminergic modulatory neurons drive forward walking with increased turning, and the activity of individual neurons is correlated with ipsiversive turning. Hence, MDN and DopaMeander control opposite regimes of walking on different hierarchical levels. Computational models reveal that their activity predicts key parameters of spontaneous walking. Moreover, we find that both MDN and DopaMeander are gated out during flight. This suggests that neuronal populations across levels of control are modulated by the behavioral state to minimize cross-talk between motor programs.

">Acute EtOH enhances septohippocampal coordination but disrupts intrinsic hippocampal theta dynamics during foraging</a></h4>

              
                Theta oscillations - rhythmic patterns of synchronous activity within discrete brain regions - are known to support memory, navigation, and behavioral coordination, and are sensitive to pharmacological manipulation. Acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure has been shown to alter theta oscillations, but its effects on transient theta bursts and cross-regional coordination during naturalistic behavior remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the medial septum (MS), hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in freely foraging mice following intraperitoneal injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg) or saline. We analyzed spectral power, theta burst dynamics, phase, and lag timing. Burst features from CA1 were used to train a machine learning classifier to predict session condition. EtOH impaired locomotion and reduced goal-directed behaviors, particularly early in the session. In CA1, theta power shifted toward lower frequencies and lagged coherence declined. EtOH increased the frequency but reduced the duration of theta bursts in CA1, and in MS, only burst count increased. EtOH enhanced the temporal alignment of MS-CA1 burst pairs. Phase-locking between CA1 and MS during coupled bursts remained present but showed altered structure. Our classifier achieved robust performance using burst features such as skew and entropy, and reliably distinguished treatment conditions. EtOH modulates septohippocampal dynamics by altering the timing and structure of theta bursts. These results suggest that burst-level features are sensitive markers of EtOH's circuit-level effects during naturalistic behavior.

">Human hippocampal ripples loosen medial prefrontal constraints to foster creative thinking</a></h4>

              
                Creative thinking often requires breaking away from dominant mental schemas to generate novel and useful ideas. Yet how the human brain relaxes schematic constraints to enable creativity remains unclear. Using human intracranial EEG recordings, we found that moments of creative idea generation were accompanied by increased hippocampal ripple events, a concurrent reduction in ripple-triggered high-frequency activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and greater divergence of ripple-triggered mPFC activity patterns from the typical, schema-like task state. These effects followed a dorsal-ventral gradient within the mPFC and were most pronounced in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), a region heavily involved in schematic representation. Together, our findings suggest that hippocampal ripples can transiently disengage medial prefrontal schema constraints, thereby promoting more flexible and creative thinking.

">Normal aging impacts the extent and diversity of neural plasticity induced in the mouse brain with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an attractive tool to promote healthy brain ageing in older adults and treat age-related neurological conditions. Despite its popularity, the neurological processes and plasticity mechanisms altered by rTMS in the aged brain, and where these changes occur in the brain are unknown. Furthermore, it is not known why different rTMS protocols induce different changes in the aged brain, or why rTMS is less effective in older adults compared to younger adults. Using spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered that rTMS primarily acts on genes related to synaptic plasticity in both cortical and subcortical circuits in aged mice, but the specific changes were dependent on the brain region and even down to individual cortical layers in the motor and somatosensory cortices. Comparing our results from aged mice to young adult mice revealed that rTMS acts on a larger variety of neural plasticity mechanisms in the young adult brain, and that rTMS was less effective at altering gene expression related to neural plasticity in the aged brain, but this varied between brain regions and the protocol of rTMS applied. These findings provide a comprehensive map of the mechanisms altered by rTMS across the aged brain and highlight the need to consider the effect of ageing when optimising rTMS protocols for older populations.

">Spatial transcriptomic profiling uncovers the molecular effects of the neurotoxicant polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the brains of adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Environmental toxicants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are highly stable synthetic organic compounds that are present in air, water, and soil. PCBs have been identified in post-mortem human brains of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a possible link between environmental factors and disease risk. Research has revealed an association between PCB exposure and cognitive decline. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate how PCB mixtures relevant to humans affect brain function and cognition. To investigate the effects of PCBs on memory and transcriptomic profiles, we exposed adult male C57BL/6J mice orally to a synthetic PCB mixture daily. After seven weeks of exposure, the mice were assessed in a spatial object recognition task (SOR) to evaluate long-term spatial memory. Our findings showed that mice exposed to PCBs exhibited deficits in long-term spatial memory. To examine the molecular effects of PCB on the brain, we used a spatial transcriptomics technique to analyze gene expression changes in five brain regions: the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, caudal putamen, and fiber tracts. Our analysis of spatial gene expression revealed the molecular signatures influenced by PCB in these susceptible brain regions of mice. Network analysis suggests that these changes are associated with higher chlorinated PCBs present in the brain. Additionally, we show that PCB exposure disrupts the expression of tight junction proteins, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, our results offer mechanistic insights into how PCB exposure affects brain function and cognition.

">MOTUM: a system for Motion Online Tracking Under MRI</a></h4>

              
                Attempts to implement realistic body-environment interactions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have developed expensive, hardly reproducible, and task-specific setups. Here, we introduce MOTUM (Motion Online Tracking Under MRI), a novel system that combines real-time kinematic tracking with immersive virtual reality, enabling participants to perform naturalistic movements inside the scanner. As a proof-of-concept, we tested MOTUM during a reach-to-grasp task with and without visual feedback of one's hand (N = 7). The system achieved high-fidelity motion tracking, induced an intense immersive experience, evoked expected sensorimotor brain activations, and maintained high fMRI data quality. Standard fMRI control metrics were below the critical threshold in 99% of volumes, indicating that participants' arm movements had minimal impact on head motion and data quality. While hand movements had little to no effect on brain activity, arm movements resulted in sparse spurious correlations that were easily controlled for. Critically, MOTUM allowed us to extract rich kinematic indices and link them directly to brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. Parametric modulation analyses revealed that natural variations in movement dynamics significantly influenced neural responses in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. In sum, MOTUM is a robust method to study motor control and beyond, enabling a new class of fMRI experiments that bridge ecological realism and experimental control, pushing current neuroimaging research towards real-life neuroscience.

                Methods for monitoring physiological changes in cellular Ca2+ levels have been in high demand for their utility in monitoring neuronal signaling. Recently, we introduced SCANR (Split-Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease Calcium-regulated Neuron Recorder), which reports on Ca2+ changes in cells through the binding of calmodulin and M13 to reconstitute an active TEV protease. First-generation SCANR marked all of the Ca2+ spikes that occur throughout the lifetime of the cell, but it did not have a mechanism for controlling the time window in which recording of physiological changes in Ca2+ occurred. Here, we explore both chemical and light-based strategies for controlling the time and place in which Ca2+ recording occurs. We describe the adaptation of six popular chemo- and opto-genetics methods for controlling protein activity and subcellular localization to the SCANR system. We report two successful strategies, one that leverages the LOV-J optogenetics system for sterically controlling protein interactions and another that employs chemogenetic manipulation of subcellular protein distribution using the FKBP/FRB rapamycin binding pair.

">Neural affect decoding from minimal spectrotemporal glimpses of voice signals</a></h4>

              
                Decoding affect information from voice signals is challenging in natural environments where noise masks the most diagnostic and discriminative acoustic voice information. The extent to which neural affect decoding is resilient against or vulnerable to extreme noise-masking of voice signals remains largely unknown. Here, we performed three experiments using an auditory bubble technique to randomly mask and unmask certain spectrotemporal voice features similar to natural noise masking. First, using psychoacoustic voice-in-noise testing, we observed that a substantial part of the full spectrotemporal space of voice signals contains diagnostic cues essential for accurate affect decoding, contributing to the partial robustness of the voice signals under noise masking. Affective voice signals (joy, aggression) were correctly identified from early broadband spectral and temporally extended high-frequency information. Neutral voices were primarily identified from low- to medium-level spectral information with high perceptual relevance near the voice offset. Second, using human neuroimaging, we mechanistically linked neural activity to minimal spectrotemporal patches that enable accurate affect classification from voice samples. A neural network composed of (sub-)cortical auditory and limbic nodes, fronto-insular regions, and vocal motor mirroring nodes supported the affective discrimination of voice signals. More specifically, activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala was mechanistically linked to correct affect decisions, as determined by a reverse brain-to-decision mapping approach. Thus, decoding affect from voice signals embedded in complex noise seems partially feasible, provided that the noise does not obscure the minimal diagnostic spectrotemporal information essential for engaging cortical and subcortical limbic affect decoding mechanisms.

">Satiety does not abolish Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer but accelerates devaluation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues that predict palatable food can robustly drive behavior, override satiety signals and promote maladaptive eating habits. However, conventional human paradigms often fail to capture the dynamic interplay between hunger, satiety, and cue-induced behavioral actions. To address this, we built a novel automated dispenser synchronized with task events and integrated into an adapted human Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm to deliver real, consumable food rewards in real time, allowing participants to eat online and thereby induce satiation or sustain hunger. In one experiment, we manipulated food rewards by varying portion size and consumption timing. Large portions consumed immediately induced rapid satiation, whereas small, trial-by-trial portions kept participants non-satiated; correspondingly, large portions accelerated devaluation of the food reward, evidenced by a pronounced decline in instrumental responding, while small portions sustained cue-driven behavior over time. In a subsequent experiment, small, immediately consumed food rewards (which kept participants non-satiated) were directly compared with real-time monetary rewards. Although both reward types initially invigorated behavior, the motivational impact of monetary rewards declined quicker, suggesting that the absence of physiological feedback renders secondary reinforcers more vulnerable to rapid devaluation. These findings suggest that satiety accelerates, rather than abolishes, the influence of food-associated cues. The distinct temporal dynamics observed for food and monetary outcomes underscore the importance of real-time ingestion in human PIT paradigms, offering new insights into the mechanisms by which physiological states modulate cue-driven devaluation.

">Many-Two-One: Diverse Representations Across Visual Pathways Emerge from A Single Objective</a></h4>

              
                How the human brain supports diverse behaviours has been debated for decades. The canonical view divides visual processing into distinct "what" and "where/how" streams -- however, their origin and independence remain contested. Here, using deep neural network models that accurately predict hours of brain recordings, we computationally characterise how cortex processes dynamic vision. Despite the diversity of cortical regions and thereby supported tasks, we identify two fundamental computations that explain neural activity across visual cortex: object and appearance-free motion recognition. Strikingly, a single objective underlies both: these inherent computations in the brain emerge from optimising for understanding world dynamics, and their arrangement is highly distributed and smooth across cortex rather than strictly aligning with the two visual streams. Our results suggest that the human brain's ability to integrate complex information across seemingly distinct representational pathways may originate from the single goal of modelling the world.

">Non-invasive Stimulation of Contralateral Primary Motor Cortex Reduces the Amount of Skill Generalization to the Untrained Arm</a></h4>

              
                Successfully learned motor skills can generalize or transfer to the untrained arm. The neural substrate underlying such intermanual/interlimb generalization of newly acquired skill memory is unclear. Here, we focused on contralateral primary motor cortex (cM1) which is considered a key brain area for skill learning and memory consolidation. We probed the causal role of cM1 in intermanual skill generalization in a two-day study involving right-handed young individuals (n=31) who learned a novel motor skill reaching task. Immediately following (right-arm) learning, we delivered low-frequency (1Hz, 1800 pulses) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to target left cM1 in one group of individuals (n=15), while another group (n=16) served as an active control in which ipsilateral M1 (iM1) was targeted. On the same day we measured corticospinal excitability (CSE) to assess learning-induced and rTMS-induced neuroplastic changes occurring in the targeted M1s. Next day after 24-hours, both groups were tested for intermanual skill generalization (left-arm), followed by a brief test of intralimb retention (right-arm). Our results show that stimulating cM1, versus iM1, reduced the amount of generalization to the untrained arm on the next day, without affecting its (re)learning ability or the follow-up retention performance of the trained arm. Further, rTMS stimulation induced a net facilitation in CSE- with higher facilitation tending to correlate to lower generalization in a subset of high learners in cM1 group. Taken together, this study highlights the role of cM1 in skill generalization such that it seems to mediate the early transfer of learning to the untrained arm.

">C1q limits cystoid edema by maintaining basal beta-catenin-dependent signaling and blood-retina barrier function</a></h4>

              
                Macular edema (ME) causes significant vision impairment and occurs in several prevalent retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR), choroidal neovascularization (CNV), retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. Retinal edema typically results from dysfunction of the blood-retina barrier (BRB), which is associated with increased retinal expression of complement components. It is unclear whether the classical complement pathway has detrimental or protective roles in the context of BRB dysfunction. Here, we characterize Tspan12 KODBM (Disrupted Barrier Maintenance) mice, a new mouse model of cystoid edema based on genetically and pharmacologically manipulating beta-catenin-dependent norrin/frizzled4 (FZD4) signaling. We assess BRB function, cystoid edema, ERG, and microglia activation outcomes in an aging study with WT, C1qa KO, Tspan12 KODBM, and Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa KO compound mutant mice. Phenotypic analyses and cell-based experiments indicate that C1QA contributes to maintaining basal beta-catenin-dependent signaling and that the absence of C1QA exacerbates BRB dysfunction, cystoid edema, and neuroinflammation in Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa compound mutant mice. Activation of beta-catenin-dependent signaling by a FZD4/LRP5 agonist antibody modality achieves complete resolution of cystoid edema. This study shows that reducing or enhancing norrin/frizzled4 signaling can increase or decrease cystoid edema, respectively, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in ME. Furthermore, this study provides novel insights into the contribution of C1QA to BRB maintenance.

">Cocaine and Morphine Converge to Disrupt Chloride Homeostasis in Ventral Tegmental Area GABA Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Identifying shared neural mechanisms influenced by diverse classes of drugs of abuse is essential for understanding addiction and for developing broad-spectrum treatments for substance use disorders. Previous studies indicate that many drugs of abuse increase dopamine output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by altering the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto dopamine neurons, thereby promoting maladaptive plasticity within reward circuits. Here, we demonstrate in rats that acute injections of morphine and cocaine, but not saline, disrupt chloride homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons. This disruption is characterized by a depolarized GABAA reversal potential, impaired chloride extrusion, and posttranslational downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2. Although previous studies linked drug-induced posttranslational downregulation of KCC2 in the VTA to glucocorticoid receptor activation, we found that a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist did not prevent cocaine- and morphine-induced disruption of chloride homeostasis. Instead, our data show that dopamine receptor activation is both necessary and sufficient for these alterations. Notably, chloride homeostasis remains impaired 30 days after volitional morphine self-administration, indicating long-lasting plasticity. These findings complement previous work on nicotine and alcohol, suggesting a shared mechanism of inhibitory plasticity in the VTA following drug exposure. Given that chloride dysregulation in VTA GABA neurons influences downstream circuit function and promotes maladaptive behaviors associated with drug use, we propose KCC2 as a promising therapeutic target for substance use disorders.

">Activation of Endogenous Spinal Cord Stem Cell Mediates Recovery Induced by Olfactory Ensheathing Cell Transplantation Following Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to irreversible motor and sensory deficits and currently has no curative treatment. Among the various therapeutic strategies explored, cell transplantation, using either stem or differentiated cells, has been extensively studied. One of the most promising approaches involves the use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which have demonstrated unique potential to promote functional recovery and tissue repair following SCI. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how OEC transplantation modulates endogenous spinal stem cells, with a particular focus on ependymal cells. Using inducible transgenic mouse lines and fate-mapping approaches, we show that OEC transplantation significantly enhances ependymal cell proliferation and self-renewal both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, OECs promote astrocytic differentiation of ependymal progeny, which express low levels of inhibitory molecules, suggesting a supportive role in creating a permissive scar microenvironment. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that OEC transplantation downregulates genes associated with axonal growth inhibition, thereby contributing to improved neuronal survival. Finally, by using a unique transgenic mouse model in which ependymal cell proliferation is genetically blocked, we demonstrate that the beneficial effects of OEC transplantation depend on ependymal cell activation. Together, these findings establish ependymal cells as essential mediators of the regenerative response induced by OECs. They also highlight a therapeutic strategy based on activating and modulating endogenous stem cells via the transient presence of non-integrating transplanted glial cells. This work contributes to our understanding of SCI repair and supports the clinical potential of OEC-based cell therapies.

Thirty-four young adults involving an adapted ER task, downregulated their negative emotional experiences through reinterpretation. Strategy preparation nearly aligns with strategy use during reactive ER, while preparation precedes use during proactive ER. Behavioral data showed that reactive ER was more effective than proactive ER. Event-related potential (ERP) and decoding results revealed that goal representation engaged attentional resources to maintain regulatory information and suppress irrelevant interference during preparation. This intensive resource allocation may impair the working memory capacity, thereby reducing the regulatory effect in proactive ER. In contrast, reactive ER, unhindered by the preparation stage, preserved sufficient cognitive resources to adaptively re-engage in ER as necessary. Overall, preparation not only influenced the timing of ER but also impeded strategy use. The regulatory effect was determined by the brain activation patterns observed during the regulation stage.</span>

A seed-based and dynamic functional connectivity approach enabled us to examine default-mode network spatial and temporal properties and their white matter substrates. While spatial default-mode network patterns were similar across groups, we found differences in temporal dynamics of 1 network and in white matter–default-mode network correspondence. These differences were either observed in white matter tracts directly associated with complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum or in white matter tracts such as the fornix and the anterior and posterior commissures, which have been previously implicated in neuroplasticity in agenesis of the corpus callosum.

Here, we investigated how covert shifts of attention and associated modulations of posterior alpha power are affected after FEF inhibition by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neither right nor left FEF disruption impaired attention task performance. This absence of behavioral effects seems to be related to the here employed long cue-target intervals, giving the attention system sufficient time to compensate (across trials) for the TMS insult. Alpha power modulation was quantified both in the entire cue-target interval, and in two additional time windows: after cue presentation (early) and before target appearance (late). TMS effects on alpha power clearly differed across time windows, being strongest in the early time window. The reduced TMS effect in the late window might reflect recovery/compensation employed by the attention system, possibly explaining the lack of TMS-induced behavioral effects. These results are in line with a central role of the FEF in the control of visuospatial attention and support the notion of compensation mechanisms in cognitive brain systems in the temporal domain.</span>

In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, nonspecialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30&nbsp;week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 participants per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 5,831 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per participant of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

                <p>Previous research suggests that stress predisposes individuals to develop substance use disorders by disrupting the brain processing of rewards. Yet, how stressful experiences disrupt the brain processing of reward-related cues at the neuronal level is poorly understood. Intermittent social defeat (ISD) is a stress animal model that increases reward-seeking behavior, drug self-administration, and choice impulsivity up to several weeks after stress. We tested the hypothesis that ISD disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in key areas of the brain that regulate reward-seeking. We examined in vivo neuronal dynamics in response to reward cues in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) simultaneously, and longitudinally, in control and stressed Long&ndash;Evans male rats during a discriminative stimulus reward-seeking task. In the dmPFC, ISD decreased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1 and 15&nbsp;d after stress, which indicates a long-term degradation of outcome anticipation-related processing. In the VTA, ISD increased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1&nbsp;d after stress but decreased cue-evoked activity 15&nbsp;d after stress. Moreover, decoding analysis in single neurons and populations showed parallel increases and decreases in reward discrimination accuracy in the VTA which points to time-dependent changes in incentive salience after stress. These results demonstrate that ISD differently disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in the dmPFC and the VTA and identify novel neurofunctional signatures that underlie a higher predisposition to seek out rewards after stress.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Recent studies report reduced dementia risk following shingles vaccination, suggesting that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency contributes to neuroimmune vulnerability. We propose that subclinical VZV reactivation acts as a renewable peripheral immune stressor, amplifying microglial priming in aging brains. Shingles vaccination may suppress this viral reservoir, reducing cumulative inflammatory tone. In this opinion article we contrast this mechanism with trained immunity and highlight how pathogen-specific and systemic effects may converge. Finally, we discuss the role of innate phagocytosis and resolution, suggesting that impaired clearance, rather than activation alone, sustains neuroinflammatory risk. Vaccination may thus modulate innate responsiveness and preserve neuroimmune balance in later life.

                Microglial ADGRG1 drives a protective state in Alzheimer’s disease by activating the transcription factor MYC, which upregulates genes associated with homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. This leads to increased Aβ clearance, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97125">Cingulate cortex shapes early postnatal development of social vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                The social dynamics of vocal behavior have major implications for social development in humans. We asked whether early life damage to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is closely associated with socioemotional regulation more broadly, impacts the normal development of vocal expression. The common marmoset provides a unique opportunity to study the developmental trajectory of vocal behavior and to track the consequences of early brain damage on aspects of social vocalizations. We created ACC lesions in neonatal marmosets and compared their pattern of vocalization to that of age-matched controls throughout the first 6 weeks of life. We found that while early life ACC lesions had little influence on the production of vocal calls, developmental changes to the quality of social contact calls and their associated sequential and acoustic characteristics were compromised. These animals made fewer social contact calls, and when they did, they were short, loud, and monotonic. We further determined that damage to ACC in infancy results in a permanent alteration in downstream brain areas known to be involved in social vocalizations, such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray. Namely, in the adult, these structures exhibited diminished GABA immunoreactivity relative to control animals, likely reflecting disruption of the normal inhibitory balance following ACC deafferentation. Together, these data indicate that the normal development of social vocal behavior depends on the ACC and its interaction with other areas in the vocal network during early life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106284">Neocortical layer-5 tLTD relies on non-ionotropic presynaptic NMDA receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                In the textbook view, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity by fluxing Ca<sup>2+</sup> when simultaneously depolarized and glutamate bound. Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Rab3-interacting molecule 1αβ (RIM1αβ) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We, therefore, tested in juvenile mouse visual cortex if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC→PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1αβ deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC→PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101327">A SMARTTR workflow for multi-ensemble atlas mapping and brain-wide network analysis</a></h4>

              
                In the last decade, activity-dependent strategies for labeling multiple immediate early gene ensembles in mice have generated unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. However, few strategies exist for brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles, including their overlapping population, and none incorporate capabilities for downstream network analysis. Here, we introduce a scalable workflow to analyze traditionally coronally sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems. Intrinsic to this pipeline is simple multi-ensemble atlas registration and statistical testing in R (SMARTTR), an R package which wraps mapping capabilities with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization, and support for import of external datasets. We demonstrate the versatility of SMARTTR by mapping the ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust stress model. Applying network analysis, we find that exposure to inescapable shock (IS), compared to context training, results in decreased centrality of regions engaged in spatial and contextual processing and higher influence of regions involved in somatosensory and affective processing. During LH expression, the substantia nigra emerges as a highly influential region that shows a functional reversal following IS, indicating a possible regulatory function of motor activity during helplessness. We also report that IS results in a robust decrease in reactivation activity across a number of cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar regions, indicating suppression of ensemble reactivation may be a neurobiological signature of LH. These results highlight the emergent insights uniquely garnered by applying our analysis approach to multiple ensemble datasets and demonstrate the strength of our workflow as a hypothesis-generating toolkit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88598">Cell type-specific contributions to a persistent aggressive internal state in female Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Persistent internal states are important for maintaining survival-promoting behaviors, such as aggression. In female <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we have previously shown that individually activating either aIPg or pC1d cell types can induce aggression. Here we investigate further the individual roles of these cholinergic, sexually dimorphic cell types, and the reciprocal connections between them, in generating a persistent aggressive internal state. We find that a brief 30-second optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons was sufficient to promote an aggressive internal state lasting at least 10 minutes, whereas similar stimulation of pC1d neurons did not. While we previously showed that stimulation of pC1e alone does not evoke aggression, persistent behavior could be promoted through simultaneous stimulation of pC1d and pC1e, suggesting an unexpected synergy of these cell types in establishing a persistent aggressive state. Neither aIPg nor pC1d show persistent neuronal activity themselves, implying that the persistent internal state is maintained by other mechanisms. Moreover, inactivation of pC1d did not significantly reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, arguing that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity. Our results suggest the need for alternative models to explain persistent female aggression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101526">No effect of additional education on long-term brain structure, a preregistered natural experiment in thousands of individuals</a></h4>

              
                Education is related to a wide variety of beneficial health, behavioral, and societal outcomes. However, whether education causes long-term structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in the UK Biobank. Using regression discontinuity (RD) – a causal inference method – we find no evidence of an effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or ‘brain reserve’ theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of RD on neural data – opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.

                Dendritic morphology is a defining characteristic of neuronal subtypes. In <i>Drosophila</i>, heterotypic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing different receptors display diverse dendritic morphologies, but whether such diversity exists among homotypic ORNs remains unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy on cryofixed tissues, we analyzed the majority of CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (ab1C) and their odor-sensing neighbors (ab1D) in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> antenna. Surprisingly, ab1C neurons featured flattened, sheet-like dendrites—distinct from the cylindrical branches typical of odor-sensing neurons—and displayed remarkable diversity, ranging from plain sheets to tube-like structures that enclose several neighboring dendrites, forming ‘dendrite-within-dendrite’ structures. Similarly, ab1D dendrites varied from simple, unbranched forms to numerously branched morphologies. These findings suggest that morphological heterogeneity is common even among homotypic ORNs, potentially expanding their functional adaptability and ranges of sensory physiological properties.

                <p>Neuroimaging data reveal that a functional locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is critical in maintaining cognitive performance during aging. However, older adults show reduced LC integrity and altered functional connectivity, demonstrating both structural declines and dysfunction. The LC-NA system mediates mechanisms of attention processing and eye tracking studies have shown that older adults are slower and more distractible compared with young adults in visual search tasks. Prior studies have shown that mindfulness meditation modulates LC noradrenergic activity, increases gray matter volume in the brainstem, and improves attentional control. Thus, in a preregistered longitudinal study, we investigated whether 30&nbsp;d of guided mindfulness meditation using a mobile application improved attentional control measured with eye movements. We hypothesized that older adults would show greater benefits from the mindfulness intervention compared with young adults. In two oculomotor search tasks, we identified that guided mindfulness practice improved saccadic reaction times, but that other longitudinal benefits in goal-directed attentional control or distractibility by task-irrelevant salient stimuli may be from repeated practice. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for age differences in response to the mindfulness intervention between young, middle-aged, and older adults, nor among scores on mindfulness questionnaires. Our findings show that short-term mindfulness practice can modulate cognition, specifically with the speed of overt orienting of attention that may not be observable in self-report measures. This study is the first to show the utility of mindfulness on cognition using a highly reliable measure in eye movements and suggests future longer-term intervention studies may be warranted.</p>

                <p>Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. At this scale, such projects can tackle big challenges and engage diverse participants. Inspired by projects in mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of widening access to such projects even further, by running a massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. The key difference, with prior neuroscientific efforts, being that our entire project (code, results, and writing) was public from the outset, and that anyone could participate. To achieve this, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localization task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at online workshops. Our hope was that the resulting range of participants would allow us to make discoveries that a single team would have been unlikely to find. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biological parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localization in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. While our scientific results were not groundbreaking, our project demonstrates the potential for massively collaborative projects to transform neuroscience.</p>

                <p>by Hanne Zillmer, Dirk Walther</p>

With the availability of reliably predicted 3D-structures for essentially all known proteins, characterizing the entirety of compound-binding sites (binding pockets on proteins) has become a possibility. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e., the pocketomes, of eleven species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.

                <p>by Christiaan H. van Dorp, Joshua I. Gray, Daniel H. Paik, Donna L. Farber, Andrew J. Yates</p>

Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep phenotyping therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2<sup>hi</sup> CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.

Bacteria live in diverse communities, forming complex networks of interacting species. A central question in bacterial ecology is whether species engage in cooperative or competitive interactions. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By computationally simulating thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This modeling approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions in response to the availability of environmental resources.

                <p>by De-fei Xiong, Yi-yang Zhang, Zhi-chao Wang, Yuan-ming Zheng, Han-qing Zhang, Gang Wang</p>

The detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates multiple signaling pathways, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs), which are essential for host survival during viral infection. Precise control of PRR gene expression is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Here, we showed that Mediator complex subunit 23 (Med23) is required for the precise production of the innate immune receptor RIG-I in response to RNA virus infection. Med23 deficiency markedly enhances the production of IFN-I, proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both multiple cell lines (MEFs, RAW264.7 cells, and HeLa cells) and mouse primary macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] and peritoneal macrophages [PEMs]) infected with RNA virus VSV or stimulated with poly(I:C). Myeloid-specific Med23 knockout mice were generated to test the critical role of Med23 in host resistance to VSV infection in vivo. Mechanistically, Med23 interacts with the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) to negatively regulate RIG-I, thereby modulating IFN-I signaling. Collectively, these findings elucidate a previously unrecognized role of Med23 as a gatekeeper of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response and suggest a potential target for controlling viral infection.

Working memory (WM) is a fundamental cognitive function crucial adaptive behavior. The intricate interplay between the frontal cortex and striatum in governing WM maintenance and updating remains a central question. In this study, we employed optogenetics to demonstrate that inhibiting both dorsomedial striatum (DMS) D<sub>1</sub>R- and D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons enhances WM, while their activation impairs it across T-maze- and operant-based delayed-non-match-to-place (DNMTP) paradigms in mice. Notably, these neurons selectively modulate WM maintenance and retrieval, with no impact on encoding. Analysis through signal detection theory (SDT) revealed specific regulation of WM signal detection sensitivity, with no alterations in motivational or motor states during the operant DNMTP task. Interestingly, DMS D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons govern WM regulation under low cognitive load, switching to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons as cognitive load increases. Activation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons during the delay phase severely impairs WM under high cognitive load, a deficit rescued by optogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), or dopaminergic terminals in DMS. Additionally, treatment with the D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH39166, but not the D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist Sulpiride mitigates these impairments. Collectively, our findings propose a “relay” model wherein cognitive load-dependent WM control switches from DMS D<sub>2</sub>R- to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons, offering nuanced, complementary, and inhibitory regulation of WM maintenance and retrieval. This study suggests potential strategies to enhance WM by promoting a suppressive state in DMS and to increase WM capacity through specific modulation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons.

                <p>by Jeremy Mo, Hanyun Zhang, Alexander Swarbrick</p>

Cancer treatments often fall short of durable cures, yet most therapeutic strategies neglect the tumor stroma. A concerted effort is needed to understand, model, target and reprogram the tumor ‘soil’, recognizing its profound influence on cancer from tumorigenesis to therapy resistance.

Current anti-cancer treatments often neglect the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in resistance and progression. In this Perspective, the authors argue that better preclinical models, understanding of stromal heterogeneity and integration of TME assessments into drug development are needed to improve treatment efficacy.

                <p>by Ha Neul Lee, Julia C. Hardy, Emily H. Pool, Jin-Fan Zhang, Su Hyun Kim, William F. Buhl, Jessica G.H. Bruystens, Sohum Mehta, Susan S. Taylor, Jin Zhang</p>

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a ubiquitous second messenger, regulates a variety of cellular functions with high specificity. We previously showed that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate spatial compartmentalization of cAMP. However, how RIα LLPS regulates cellular function is largely unknown. Here, we identify the formation of RIα condensates in MIN6 β cells and reveal key roles for RIα LLPS in regulating β cell function. By combining CRISPR-based RIα knockout with an RIα mutant (Y122A) that exhibits defective cAMP-induced LLPS, we demonstrate that RIα LLPS drives cAMP compartmentalization to tune β cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP oscillation frequency, control insulin secretion, regulate CREB-mediated gene expression and prevent uncontrolled proliferation. Our data establish the Y122A mutant as a selective molecular tool for studying RIα LLPS and expand our understanding of the functional impact of LLPS-driven protein assemblies.

     alt="The Role of the Amygdala in Nonbreeding Aggression in Male Green Anole Lizards, Anolis carolinensis"/>
<p>During the non-breeding season, male green anoles display aggression that is regulated by the amygdala. Lesioning the amygdala led to a decrease in aggression, which was not observed in animals where the amygdala was missed or in saline controls. Also, plasma testosterone levels did not influence aggression in these males. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aggression is a set of hostile behaviors expressed to defend and/or obtain resources. Although a social behavior network (SBN) has been postulated to explain the neural mechanisms underlying aggression, the extent of behavioral modulation by specific brain regions remains unclear. Additionally, the regulation of the SBN during the nonbreeding season (NBS) in seasonal breeders that express territorial aggression is still unknown. Thus, we aimed to study the role of one node of the SBN, the amygdala, in green anole lizards as this species displays dynamic changes in aggression, reduced testosterone levels, and increased number of neurons in the amygdala during the NBS compared to the breeding season. Male lizards were placed in a stereotactic apparatus and injected with either a neurotoxin (staurosporine) to damage the amygdala or saline as a control. These focal male lizards were also exposed to size-matched conspecifics before and 3 days after surgery to quantify aggressive behaviors. We found that partly damaging the amygdala significantly reduced aggression levels but did not affect their latency to initiate aggressive behaviors, providing support for the idea that the amygdala mediates aggression but not motivation in this species. Additionally, there was no relationship between aggression and plasma testosterone levels, suggesting that the nonbreeding aggression we measured was independent of plasma testosterone levels. These results indicate that the amygdala might play a significant role in the SBN to regulate NBS aggression and is not dependent on plasma testosterone levels.</p>

<p>The study shows that amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) make up subpopulations of conventional and displaced amacrine cells. They include ON but not OFF starburst amacrine cells and multiple types of wide-field presumed GABAergic amacrine cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 30 types of amacrine cells have been described in the primate retina, yet few are well characterized. Here, we investigated amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the retinas of human, macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis, Macaca nemestrina</i>), and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) monkeys using immunohistochemistry and intracellular injections, with a focus on displaced amacrine cells (dACs) in the ganglion cell layer. The spatial density of CaMKII-positive dACs decreases with the distance from the fovea, but in the peripheral temporal retina, the density of CaMKII-positive dACs nevertheless exceeds the density of retinal ganglion cells. In all species, CaMKII-positive dACs include cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells, but in the human retina, only 60% of the ON ChAT population is CaMKII-positive. Conversely, in the marmoset and the macaque, about 80% of ON ChAT cells co-express CaMKII, but only 55% of ON ChAT cells in humans do so. Intracellular injections of CaMKII-positive dACs with the lipophilic dye DiI revealed ON starburst and semilunar Type 3 cells in all three species, but in the human retina, at least three additional types were detected. In the inner nuclear layer, CaMKII is expressed by multiple populations of amacrine cells, which are distinguished based on their soma size and staining intensity, but OFF ChAT cells do not co-express CaMKII. We conclude that ON- and OFF-ChAT cells show distinct patterns of CaMKII expression and that the diversity of CaMKII-expressing dACs in humans is greater than that in marmoset or macaque retina.</p>

<p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed injury-induced changes in neuronal metabolites in the primary motor cortex and lumbar cord enlargement of patients with spinal cord injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts spinal tracts and neuronal pathways, including those in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lumbar cord enlargement (LCE) involved in motor control. This study sought to determine whether metabolite concentrations deviate between SCI and healthy controls (HC) in M1 and LCE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and structural MRI, and if these correlate with clinical impairment. Sixteen chronic SCI (mean age: 54.7 ± 14.8y) and 19 HCs (mean age: 53.2 ± 18.8y) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS to quantify metabolites along with T<sub>1</sub>- and T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted MRI to assess tissue structural changes. Associations between metabolic and structural changes and clinical impairment were also assessed. Patients showed significant atrophy in both white matter of the LCE (HC: 37.7 ± 4.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 33.9 ± 3.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −10.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and gray matter (HC: 20.9 ± 2.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 19.4 ± 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −7.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) with respect to total creatine (tCr) was reduced in M1 of SCI (HC: 1.94 ± 0.21, SCI: 1.77 ± 0.14, ∆ = −8.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and in the LCE (HC: 2.48 ± 0.76, SCI: 1.81 ± 0.80, ∆ = −27.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, reduced tNAA/tCr in both the atrophied LCE and M1 suggests widespread neuronal changes including cell atrophy and/or cell loss after injury. These findings provide in vivo evidence for retrograde and trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, which may underline the atrophy observed in the motor system in SCI. Ultimately, this highlights the potential for metabolic and structural biomarkers to improve the monitoring of subtle neurodegeneration following SCI and to enhance future regenerative treatment strategies.</p>

                As a step toward human translation, Wang et al. demonstrate, without using contrast agents, the ability to map fine-scale cerebrovasculature (intracortical arterioles and venules) in vivo in primates using a human 7 T MRI scanner. This introduces a primate model for studying cerebral vascular architecture and hemodynamics in health and disease.
