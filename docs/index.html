                arXiv:2410.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study covers an approach to neural architecture search (NAS) using Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) for the design and optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In designing artificial neural networks, one crucial aspect of the innovative approach is suggesting a novel neural architecture. Currently used architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this work, we use pure Genetic Programming Approach to design CNNs, which employs only one genetic operation, i.e., mutation. In the course of preliminary experiments, our methodology yields promising results.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00518">Analysing the Influence of Reorder Strategies for Cartesian Genetic Programming</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) suffers from a specific limitation: Positional bias, a phenomenon in which mostly genes at the start of the genome contribute to a program output, while genes at the end rarely do.
  This can lead to an overall worse performance of CGP.
  One solution to overcome positional bias is to introduce reordering methods, which shuffle the current genotype without changing its corresponding phenotype.
  There are currently two different reorder operators that extend the classic CGP formula and improve its fitness value.
  In this work, we discuss possible shortcomings of these two existing operators.
  Afterwards, we introduce three novel operators which reorder the genotype of a graph defined by CGP.
  We show empirically on four Boolean and four symbolic regression benchmarks that the number of iterations until a solution is found and/or the fitness value improves by using CGP with a reorder method.
  However, there is no consistently best performing reorder operator.
  Furthermore, their behaviour is analysed by investigating their convergence plots and we show that all behave the same in terms of convergence type.

                arXiv:2410.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that connectivity within the high-dimensional recurrent layer of a reservoir network is crucial for its performance. To this end, we systematically investigate the impact of network connectivity on its performance, i.e., we examine the symmetry and structure of the reservoir in relation to its computational power. Reservoirs with random and asymmetric connections are found to perform better for an exemplary Mackey-Glass time series than all structured reservoirs, including biologically inspired connectivities, such as small-world topologies. This result is quantified by the information processing capacity of the different network topologies which becomes highest for asymmetric and randomly connected networks.

                arXiv:2410.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three state-of-the-art adaptive population control strategies (PCS) are theoretically and empirically investigated for a multi-recombinative, cumulative step-size adaptation Evolution Strategy $(\mu/\mu_I, \lambda)$-CSA-ES. First, scaling properties for the generation number and mutation strength rescaling are derived on the sphere in the limit of large population sizes. Then, the adaptation properties of three standard CSA-variants are studied as a function of the population size and dimensionality, and compared to the predicted scaling results. Thereafter, three PCS are implemented along the CSA-ES and studied on a test bed of sphere, random, and Rastrigin functions. The CSA-adaptation properties significantly influence the performance of the PCS, which is shown in more detail. Given the test bed, well-performing parameter sets (in terms of scaling, efficiency, and success rate) for both the CSA- and PCS-subroutines are identified.

                arXiv:2410.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded considerably in In-Context-Learning (ICL) based summarization. However, saliency is subject to the users' specific preference histories. Hence, we need reliable In-Context Personalization Learning (ICPL) capabilities within such LLMs. For any arbitrary LLM to exhibit ICPL, it needs to have the ability to discern contrast in user profiles. A recent study proposed a measure for degree-of-personalization called EGISES for the first time. EGISES measures a model's responsiveness to user profile differences. However, it cannot test if a model utilizes all three types of cues provided in ICPL prompts: (i) example summaries, (ii) user's reading histories, and (iii) contrast in user profiles. To address this, we propose the iCOPERNICUS framework, a novel In-COntext PERsonalization learNIng sCrUtiny of Summarization capability in LLMs that uses EGISES as a comparative measure. As a case-study, we evaluate 17 state-of-the-art LLMs based on their reported ICL performances and observe that 15 models' ICPL degrades (min: 1.6%; max: 3.6%) when probed with richer prompts, thereby showing lack of true ICPL.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00665">TAVRNN: Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph RNN Captures Neural Dynamics and Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel framework for analyzing the evolving dynamics of neuronal connectivity networks in response to external stimuli and behavioral feedback. TAVRNN captures temporal changes in network structure by modeling sequential snapshots of neuronal activity, enabling the identification of key connectivity patterns. Leveraging temporal attention mechanisms and variational graph techniques, TAVRNN uncovers how connectivity shifts align with behavior over time. We validate TAVRNN on two datasets: in vivo calcium imaging data from freely behaving rats and novel in vitro electrophysiological data from the DishBrain system, where biological neurons control a simulated environment during the game of pong. We show that TAVRNN outperforms previous baseline models in classification, clustering tasks and computational efficiency while accurately linking connectivity changes to performance variations. Crucially, TAVRNN reveals that high game performance in the DishBrain system correlates with the alignment of sensory and motor subregion channels, a relationship not evident in earlier models. This framework represents the first application of dynamic graph representation of electrophysiological (neuronal) data from DishBrain system, providing insights into the reorganization of neuronal networks during learning. TAVRNN's ability to differentiate between neuronal states associated with successful and unsuccessful learning outcomes, offers significant implications for real-time monitoring and manipulation of biological neuronal systems.

Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has been highly effective in black-box continuous optimization, as demonstrated by its success in both benchmark problems and various real-world applications. To address the need for an accessible yet potent tool in this domain, we developed cmaes, a simple and practical Python library for CMA-ES. cmaes is characterized by its simplicity, offering intuitive use and high code readability. This makes it suitable for quickly using CMA-ES, as well as for educational purposes and seamless integration into other libraries. Despite its simplistic design, cmaes maintains enhanced functionality. It incorporates recent advancements in CMA-ES, such as learning rate adaptation for challenging scenarios, transfer learning, and mixed-integer optimization capabilities. These advanced features are accessible through a user-friendly API, ensuring that cmaes can be easily adopted in practical applications. We regard cmaes as the first choice for a Python CMA-ES library among practitioners. The software is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/cmaes.

                arXiv:2312.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite many recent works on Mixture of Experts (MoEs) for resource-efficient Transformer language models, existing methods mostly focus on MoEs for feedforward layers. Previous attempts at extending MoE to the self-attention layer fail to match the performance of the parameter-matched baseline. Our novel SwitchHead is an effective MoE method for the attention layer that successfully reduces both the compute and memory requirements, achieving wall-clock speedup, while matching the language modeling performance of the baseline Transformer. Our novel MoE mechanism allows SwitchHead to compute up to 8 times fewer attention matrices than the standard Transformer. SwitchHead can also be combined with MoE feedforward layers, resulting in fully-MoE "SwitchAll" Transformers. For our 262M parameter model trained on C4, SwitchHead matches the perplexity of standard models with only 44% compute and 27% memory usage. Zero-shot experiments on downstream tasks confirm the performance of SwitchHead, e.g., achieving more than 3.5% absolute improvements on BliMP compared to the baseline with an equal compute resource.

">Controllability and cause in human collaboration</a></h4>

              
                There has been considerable interest in how we ascertain whether an environment is controllable and the neural mechanisms mediating this process. An especially acute version of this problem occurs when multiple people collaborate towards a joint outcome. Here we demonstrate that in such ambiguous social contexts, people engage in specific patterns of behaviour that we refer to as active disambiguation. This process helps individuals establish what they themselves, as opposed to others, control and what consequence they themselves cause or that another person causes. People identify when active disambiguation is needed and engage in it at that time. A pattern of activity in the supramarginal gyrus that emerges during and after active disambiguation is linked to establishing controllability and tracking the outcomes from which control is inferred. Activity in this brain region also signals a second learning mechanism, by which individuals attribute outcomes to themselves versus others, in proportion to their perceived control.

                Animals gain motor learning via decrease of variation through repeated training. The secondary motor (M2) cortex shows an indispensable role in the learning process of the rotarod-learning task. Yet, it remains unclear how population decoding in M2 cortex guides the repetitive training to transform into motor enhancement. We recorded neuronal population activity using Ca2+ imaging during this enhancement revealing that neuronal population correlates of the persistent internal learning state evolves in the process of motor learning. With the behavioral micro-states analysis, we identify the growing periodicity, stability, and consistency with two gradually clearer point attractor in the M2 neural state space. The results show the evolution of attractors in M2 participate in decrease of training-acquisition behavior variation and provide a general framework for the mapping between arbitrary non-task motor learning and neural topological structure.

">Efficient Coding in Motor Planning</a></h4>

              
                A paramount challenge for the brain is to precisely model the world and control behavior within the confines of limited encoding capacities. Efficient coding theory posits a unified framework for understanding how neural systems enhance encoding accuracy by tuning to environmental statistics. While this theory has been thoroughly explored within the perceptual realm, it is less clear how efficient coding applies to the motor system. Here, we probe the core principles of efficient coding theory through center-out reaching tasks. Our results reveal novel sequential effects in motor planning: The current movements are biased in a direction opposite to that of recent movements, and individual differences in this repulsive bias are associated with variability within the motor system. Furthermore, we observed that movement variance escalates with the angular divergence between successive movements. These findings are consistent with the prediction of an efficient coding model for motor planning and contrast with alternative models for sequential motor effects such as Bayesian models or repeated suppression.

                Background: Technology serves as a potent tool that enhances the quality of teaching and learning experiences. However, when educators lack proficiency in utilizing technology, it leads to obstacles in providing effective education, resulting in emotions of frustration, diminished self-assurance, and uncertainty regarding their teaching abilities. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods: For this qualitative study, ten professionals engaged in university-level teaching, encompassing research domains, were selected for interviews. Inclusion criteria were based on teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active involvement during the research phase. The guiding question for the study was framed as follows: "What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?" Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results: Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. The subcategories shed light on different aspects of the faculty’s experiences, including the burden of excessive workload, the influence of social and emotional interactions, the process of adapting to evolving technologies, and the connection between expectations and the quality of their teaching. Conclusions: This research underscores the significance of technology in higher education, highlighting its potential to positively impact teaching and learning. Nevertheless, faculty members’ struggles with techno-stress indicate a pressing need for effective training and support. Establishing limits on connectivity with technology and others emerges as a crucial step in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Ultimately, addressing techno-stress and providing appropriate guidance are essential for safeguarding the well-being of university faculty members and, consequently, enhancing the overall educational experience.

                <p>This study aims to explore the correlation of serum thyroid hormone levels to cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In this retrospective study, 106 Chinese patients without cognitive impairments and 94 patients with cognitive impairments, including 55 with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 39 with PD dementia (PDD), were analyzed. Clinical data regarding the PD assessments, including disease duration, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 scores, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&ndash;Y) staging, were analyzed. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3), were measured using ELISA. Significantly altered H&ndash;Y staging, disease duration, and UPDRS Part 3 scores were observed in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Serum levels of FT3 were significantly decreased, while FT4 and TSH levels were significantly elevated in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Combined detection of TSH, FT3, and FT4 showed value in distinguishing PD patients with and without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a comparison of serum levels between PD-MCI and PDD patients revealed significant association between thyroid hormone levels and the degree of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Our findings suggest a relationship between changes in serum thyroid hormone levels and cognitive impairments in PD patients. Thyroid hormone levels, particularly FT3, may serve as potential markers for cognitive dysfunction in PD.</p>

                Global suicide rates owing to disaster impacts have been confusing because of varied and unclear results. This study aimed to investigate how suicides have occurred worldwide during disasters. The methodology used included a systematic literature review and comparative analysis. The disaster exacerbation (X, bad human nature, or suicide rate rise) perspective was compared with the disaster resilience (Y, good human nature, or suicide rate fall) perspective to extract disaster ecology (Z, neutral human nature, or suicide rate fluctuation) perspective from international leaders, government officials, researchers, and disaster victims. A major theme was that the four stakeholders would adopt the Z perspective based on the fusion of X and Y perspectives (leading to X+Y=Z), while embracing heterogeneous research, proactive and long-term strategies, education, and so on. This study relied heavily on the large-scale dynamics of suicide rates than previous studies.

                Background The WHO recommendation against the use of macrolides reflects the little low-quality evidence about the effect of azithromycin (AZ) on influenza A infection. Considering recent reports about AZ use despite the WHO’s unfavorable recommendations, we aimed to test the evidence for the usage of AZ in the treatment of influenza A infection. Methods Various online databases were searched till August 2023 and thorough text and evidence evaluation resulted in selecting 7 studies. Results The selected reports included randomized control trials (two), cohort (three), case/control (one) studies, and one case report. Pooling of the results was unattainable due to the variability among studies in patient criteria, study outcomes, and study designs. Based on the limited reports with insufficient evidence, a recommendation for the use of AZ in the treatment regimen was not possible despite the associated reduction in inflammatory cytokines by AZ administration and the absence of significant adverse effects or mortality in hospital-admitted or ICU patients. While these findings support the current guidelines for the treatment of influenza A infection, the evidence behind these guidelines and treatment characteristics were illustrated. Conclusion AZ shows a potential symptom improvement and pro-inflammatory laboratory indices in influenza A patients. Another positive aspect is the absence of complications associated with AZ administration to critically ill patients and acceptable prognosis. However, it is crucial to have more quality research on this matter that focuses on the indication of the use of AZ, and the timing of initiation, dosage, and duration of treatment while monitoring adverse events.

                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Background Schizophrenia, with its diverse and complex presentation, is a prime candidate for genetic investigation. Its heritability in both familial and sporadic cases, clinical overlap with other psychiatric conditions, and individual variations in response to treatment contribute to its complexity. Numerous genes and associated biochemical pathways show significant differences at the population, familial, and individual levels. Additionally, schizophrenia may represent an evolutionary trade-off for human brain development, creativity, and intellectual performance. Material and Methods This case pseudo-control study analyzed the whole genomes/exomes of seven Sudanese families with multiple siblings affected by schizophrenia. We examined shared variants among family members, including both cases and controls, and unique variants shared between patients but not controls. These variants were filtered based on their impact on protein function, expression levels, allele frequencies, ACMG classification for rare variants, and disease associations. Networks were created to identify central genes and common biological pathways. Results and Discussion The examination of this complex disorder in Sudanese families revealed numerous variants, both common and rare, showing differences between families and between our population and those reported in the literature. This highlights the challenge of accounting for the known heritability of the disease. Our hierarchical approach demonstrates that schizophrenia’s etiology involves the cumulative effect of various interacting variants in an ascending order of influence. Common variants are shared among all samples, while rare variants are shared among two or three families, most of which are associated with schizophrenia. In conclusion The significance lies not merely in the number of detected variants but in understanding their interactive roles, step by step, to reveal the complete picture of the disease’s phenotype.

                <p>by Bertram Klinger, Isabel Rausch, Anja Sieber, Helmut Kutz, Vanessa Kruse, Marieluise Kirchner, Philipp Mertins, Arnd Kieser, Nils Blüthgen, Dieter Kube</p>

B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling (HBL-1, OCI-LY3), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring.

                <p>by Elin K. Falla, Nik J. Cunniffe</p>

Plant viruses threaten food security and are often transmitted by insect vectors. Non-persistently transmitted (NPT) plant viruses are transmitted almost exclusively by aphids. Because virions attach to the aphid’s stylet (mouthparts) and are acquired and inoculated via brief epidermal probes, the aphid–virus interaction is highly transient, with a very short aphid virus retention time. Many NPT viruses manipulate their host plant’s phenotype to change aphid behaviour to optimise virus transmission. Epidemiological models of this have overlooked a key feature of aphid NPT virus retention: probing or feeding on a plant causes aphids to lose the virus. Furthermore, experimental studies suggest aphids could possibly inoculate multiple healthy plants within one infective period if they do not feed. Consequences of this for virus manipulation of host plant phenotype have not been explored. Our new compartmental epidemiological model includes both behaviour-based aphid dispersal and infectivity loss rates, and the ability of infective aphids to probe multiple plants before virus loss. We use our model to explore how NPT virus-induced host phenotypes affect epidemic outcomes, comparing these results to representative previous models. We find that previous models behave fundamentally differently and underestimate the benefit of an ‘attract-and-deter’ phenotype, where the virus induces increased aphid attraction to infected plants but deters them from prolonged feeding. Our results also highlight the importance of characterising NPT virus retention upon the aphid during probing. Allowing for multiple infective probes increases disease incidence and the effectiveness of virus manipulation, with implications for epidemic prediction and control.

                <p>by Safiye Celik, Jan-Christian Hütter, Sandra Melo Carlos, Nathan H. Lazar, Rahul Mohan, Conor Tillinghast, Tommaso Biancalani, Marta M. Fay, Berton A. Earnshaw, Imran S. Haque</p>

The continued scaling of genetic perturbation technologies combined with high-dimensional assays such as cellular microscopy and RNA-sequencing has enabled genome-scale reverse-genetics experiments that go beyond single-endpoint measurements of growth or lethality. Datasets emerging from these experiments can be combined to construct perturbative “maps of biology”, in which readouts from various manipulations (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, CRISPRi knockdown, compound treatment) are placed in unified, relatable embedding spaces allowing for the generation of genome-scale sets of pairwise comparisons. These maps of biology capture known biological relationships and uncover new associations which can be used for downstream discovery tasks. Construction of these maps involves many technical choices in both experimental and computational protocols, motivating the design of benchmark procedures to evaluate map quality in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here, we (1) establish a standardized terminology for the steps involved in perturbative map building, (2) introduce key classes of benchmarks to assess the quality of such maps, (3) construct 18 maps from four genome-scale datasets employing different cell types, perturbation technologies, and data readout modalities, (4) generate benchmark metrics for the constructed maps and investigate the reasons for performance variations, and (5) demonstrate utility of these maps to discover new biology by suggesting roles for two largely uncharacterized genes.

The distribution of farm locations and sizes is paramount to characterize patterns of disease spread. With some regions undergoing rapid intensification of livestock production, resulting in increased clustering of farms in peri-urban areas, measuring changes in the spatial distribution of farms is crucial to design effective interventions. However, those data are not available in many countries, their generation being resource-intensive. Here, we develop a farm distribution model (FDM), which allows the prediction of locations and sizes of poultry farms in countries with scarce data. The model combines (i) a Log-Gaussian Cox process model to simulate the farm distribution as a spatial Poisson point process, and (ii) a random forest model to simulate farm sizes (i.e. the number of animals per farm). Spatial predictors were used to calibrate the FDM on intensive broiler and layer farm distributions in Bangladesh, Gujarat (Indian state) and Thailand. The FDM yielded realistic farm distributions in terms of spatial clustering, farm locations and sizes, while providing insights on the factors influencing these distributions. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of modelling realistic farm distributions in the context of epidemic spread by simulating pathogen transmission on an array of spatial distributions of farms. We found that farm distributions generated from the FDM yielded spreading patterns consistent with simulations using observed data, while random point patterns underestimated the probability of large outbreaks. Indeed, spatial clustering increases vulnerability to epidemics, highlighting the need to account for it in epidemiological modelling studies. As the FDM maintains a realistic distribution of farm location and sizes, its use to inform mathematical models of disease transmission is particularly relevant for regions where these data are not available.

                <p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>

The optimization of brain circuit connectivity based on initial environmental input occurs during critical periods characterized by sensory experience-dependent, temporally restricted, and transiently reversible synapse elimination. This precise, targeted synaptic pruning mechanism is mediated by glial phagocytosis. Serotonin signaling has prominent, foundational roles in the brain, but functions in glia, or in experience-dependent brain circuit synaptic connectivity remodeling, have been relatively unknown. Here, we discover that serotonergic signaling between glia is essential for olfactory experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning restricted to a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> critical period. We find that experience-dependent serotonin signaling is restricted to the critical period, with both (1) serotonin production and (2) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors specifically in glia, but not neurons, absolutely required for targeted synaptic glomerulus pruning. We discover that glial 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor signaling limits the experience-dependent synaptic connectivity pruning in the critical period and that conditional reexpression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors within adult glia reestablishes “critical period-like” experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning at maturity. These results reveal an essential requirement for glial serotonergic signaling mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors for experience-dependent synapse elimination.

                <p>by Eloïse C. Déaux, Théophane Piette, Florence Gaunet, Thierry Legou, Luc Arnal, Anne-Lise Giraud</p>

Within species, vocal and auditory systems presumably coevolved to converge on a critical temporal acoustic structure that can be best produced and perceived. While dogs cannot produce articulated sounds, they respond to speech, raising the question as to whether this heterospecific receptive ability could be shaped by exposure to speech or remains bounded by their own sensorimotor capacity. Using acoustic analyses of dog vocalisations, we show that their main production rhythm is slower than the dominant (syllabic) speech rate, and that human–dog-directed speech falls halfway in between. Comparative exploration of neural (electroencephalography) and behavioural responses to speech reveals that comprehension in dogs relies on a slower speech rhythm tracking (delta) than humans’ (theta), even though dogs are equally sensitive to speech content and prosody. Thus, the dog audio-motor tuning differs from humans’, and we hypothesise that humans may adjust their speech rate to this shared temporal channel as means to improve communication efficacy.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study aims to compare the efficacy of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) on anxiety and depression between long-term and short-term treatment followed by withdrawal in <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose (Dgal)–induced senescent male rats. Thirty-two, 8-week-old, male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control rats and Dgal-treated rats (150 mg/kg/day; subcutaneously) for 18 weeks. At week 13, Dgal-treated rats were subdivided into three subgroups: (1) vehicle (DgV), (2) long-term treatment with 5ARIs, Finasteride 5 mg/kg/day, per oral for 6 weeks (DgF), (3) short-term treatment with 5ARIs, Finasteride 5 mg/kg/day, per oral for 2 weeks followed by a 4-week withdrawal period (DgW). Anxiety and depression were assessed using the elevated-plus maze (EPM) and splash test (ST). Blood was collected for biochemical analysis. After euthanasia, the brains were removed to examine brain inflammation, oxidative stress, neuroactive steroids, brain metabolites, and brain senescent markers. We found that DgV rats exhibited metabolic disturbance with a reduced preference index of the EPM, and grooming duration in ST. Increased brain neurotoxic metabolites, along with increased brain inflammation/oxidative stress, and reduced microglia complexity were observed in the DgV rats. Both therapeutic approaches improved metabolic parameters and preference index in the open arm of EPM in Dgal-treated rats, while grooming duration and microglia complexity were increased only in DgF rats. Our results indicate that Fin reduces depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors by reducing brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and brain senescent. In conclusion, long-term treatment with 5ARIs is more effective in alleviating depression than short-term treatment followed by withdrawal in Dgal-induced early senescent male rats.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A significant challenge of video-electroencephalography (vEEG) in epilepsy diagnosis is timing monitoring sessions to capture epileptiform activity. In this study, we introduce and validate “pro-ictal EEG scheduling”, a method to schedule vEEG monitoring to coincide with periods of increased seizure likelihood as a low-risk approach to enhance the diagnostic yield.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A database of long-term ambulatory vEEG monitoring sessions (n = 5,038) of adults and children was examined. Data from linked electronic seizure diaries were extracted (minimum 10 self-reported events) to generate cycle-based estimates of seizure risk. In adults, vEEG monitoring sessions coinciding with periods of estimated high-risk were allocated to the high-risk group (n = 305) and compared to remaining studies (baseline: n = 3,586). Test of proportions and risk-ratios (RR) were applied to index differences in proportions and likelihood of capturing outcome measures (abnormal report, confirmed seizure, and diary event) during monitoring. The impact of clinical and demographic factors (age, sex, epilepsy-type, and medication) was also explored.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During vEEG monitoring, the high-risk group was significantly more likely to have an abnormal vEEG report (190/305:62% vs 1,790/3,586:50% [%change = 12%], RR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.137–1.370], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), present with a confirmed seizure (56/305:18% vs 424/3,586:11% [%change = 7%], RR = 1.63, 95% CI = [1.265–2.101], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and report an event (153/305:50% vs 1,267/3,586:35% (%change = 15%), RR = 1.420, 95% CI = [1.259:1.602], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Similar effects were observed across clinical and demographic features.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first large-scale validation of pro-ictal EEG scheduling in improving the yield of vEEG. This innovative approach offers a pragmatic and low-risk strategy to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of vEEG monitoring, significantly impacting epilepsy management.

                Background Postoperative complications are an integral part of valve surgery. Common complications include hematomas, bleeding, valve dehiscence, paravalvular leak, and acute PV thrombosis. With the available data from published articles, the rate of all valve-related complications is 0.7 to 3.5% per patient annually. [1] The pathology involved is multifactorial, often blood vessel injury leading to bleeding and hematoma. Although postoperative complications are evident, incidental diagnosis of a cardiac mass in an asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable patient postoperatively is crucial, requiring non-invasive imaging for immediate surgical action. Case presentation A woman in her 50s presented with chief complaints of worsening dyspnoea with suddenonset and chest pain. Clinical findings showed apex shifted downward and outward, wide split S2, and a mid systolic murmur radiating to the mid axillary line. Twelve-lead ECG showed LA enlargement, that aligned with X-ray findings. 2D Echocardiography revealed MVP with severe MR and a dilated LV. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement as per ACC/AHA class I recommendation. However, postoperative TTE showed a remarkably large mass measuring 5.6 cm*4.6 cm in the RA. Reexploration was performed, followed by mass excision. Plenty of organized clots were seen compressing the RA. TEE showed no evidence of mass. Following stabilization,the patient was discharged considering optimal INR values and prosthetic valve function assessed by echocardiography. The patient’s symptoms improved during the first follow-up. Conclusion Although postoperative cardiac complications are common, appropriate diagnosis with TTE and TEE has benefited surgeons. TEE-guided reexploration aids surgeons in decision-making and strategic approaches. Failure to diagnose such complications in asymptomatic patients can ultimately complicate the procedure. Henceforth, sonographers must be skilled in the detection and identification of unusual complications to guide redo interventions. Such an approach minimizes mortality, redo procedures, and avoids CPB hence reducing long-term prognosis and outcomes with valve replacement.

                We have developed an in vitro model for the evaluation of potential anticoccidial properties of novel compounds aimed to control chicken coccidiosis, a costly disease for the poultry industry. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria (Apicomplexa), and it is mainly controlled by chemoprophylaxis with ionophores and chemical anticoccidials; however, there is an overall agreement about the limitation of these traditional drugs and the need to improve current methods of control. Anticoccidial activities of novel compounds is currently evaluated by expensive experiments that involve large numbers of chickens. The use of our in vitro model for the pre-screening of essential oils led to a reduction of 67% of the chickens used in the in vivo trials for validation. Eimeria parasites can only complete their life cycle in their animal host, therefore chickens are required for their propagation as they cannot be propagated in vitro. In this study, we describe how further optimisation of this in vitro model by miniaturisation can have an additional impact in reduction of the number of chickens used for the generation of parasite stocks for provision of the in vitro model. We have estimated that the use of one chicken could support the evaluation of 10 compounds with a 96-well plate format versus only two compounds with a 24-well plate format, which means an 80% reduction in chicken use. In this study we have proved that the miniaturisation into a 96-well plate format perfectly mimics the invasion and replication observed before in the 24-well plate format. In addition, the 96-well plate format has allowed the simultaneous pre-screening of higher numbers of anticoccidial drugs at different concentrations following streamlined protocols in a more cost-effective way, factors that are beneficial for a wider uptake of the model by other researchers investigating anticoccidial compounds.

                Here, Otto et al. address how the reduced expression of the intrinsically disordered FG-nucleoporin Nsp1 in aged cells relates to age-related nuclear pore complex assembly problems. They find that Nsp1 acts as a phase-state modulator, promoting a liquid-like state of FG-nucleoporin condensates and impacting general protein homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96719">Feature sequence-based genome mining uncovers the hidden diversity of bacterial siderophore pathways</a></h4>

              
                Microbial secondary metabolites are a rich source for pharmaceutical discoveries and play crucial ecological functions. While tools exist to identify secondary metabolite clusters in genomes, precise sequence-to-function mapping remains challenging because neither function nor substrate specificity of biosynthesis enzymes can accurately be predicted. Here, we developed a knowledge-guided bioinformatic pipeline to solve these issues. We analyzed 1928 genomes of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria and focused on iron-scavenging pyoverdines as model metabolites. Our pipeline predicted 188 chemically different pyoverdines with nearly 100% structural accuracy and the presence of 94 distinct receptor groups required for the uptake of iron-loaded pyoverdines. Our pipeline unveils an enormous yet overlooked diversity of siderophores (151 new structures) and receptors (91 new groups). Our approach, combining feature sequence with phylogenetic approaches, is extendable to other metabolites and microbial genera, and thus emerges as powerful tool to reconstruct bacterial secondary metabolism pathways based on sequence data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97545">GABAergic inhibition in human hMT+ predicts visuo-spatial intelligence mediated through the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prevailing opinion emphasizes fronto-parietal network (FPN) is key in mediating general fluid intelligence (gF). Meanwhile, recent studies show that human MT complex (hMT+), located at the occipito-temporal border and involved in 3D perception processing, also plays a key role in gF. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear, yet. To investigate this issue, our study targets visuo-spatial intelligence, which is considered to have high loading on gF. We use ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA/Glu concentrations in hMT+ combining resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), behavioral examinations including hMT+ perception suppression test and gF subtest in visuo-spatial component. Our findings show that both GABA in hMT+ and frontal-hMT+ functional connectivity significantly correlate with the performance of visuo-spatial intelligence. Further, serial mediation model demonstrates that the effect of hMT+ GABA on visuo-spatial gF is fully mediated by the hMT+ frontal FC. Together our findings highlight the importance in integrating sensory and frontal cortices in mediating the visuo-spatial component of general fluid intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99273">A lytic transglycosylase connects bacterial focal adhesion complexes to the peptidoglycan cell wall</a></h4>

              
                The Gram-negative bacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> glides on solid surfaces. Dynamic bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs) convert proton motive force from the inner membrane into mechanical propulsion on the cell surface. It is unclear how the mechanical force transmits across the rigid peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Here, we show that AgmT<i>,</i> a highly abundant lytic PG transglycosylase homologous to <i>Escherichia coli</i> MltG, couples bFACs to PG. Coprecipitation assay and single-particle microscopy reveal that the gliding motors fail to connect to PG and thus are unable to assemble into bFACs in the absence of an active AgmT. Heterologous expression of <i>E. coli</i> MltG restores the connection between PG and bFACs and thus rescues gliding motility in the <i>M. xanthus</i> cells that lack AgmT. Our results indicate that bFACs anchor to AgmT-modified PG to transmit mechanical force across the PG cell wall.

">CalTrig: A GUI-Based Machine Learning Approach for Decoding Neuronal Calcium Transients in Freely Moving Rodents</a></h4>

              
                Advances in in vivo Ca2+ imaging using miniatured microscopes have enabled researchers to study single-neuron activity in freely moving animals. Tools such as MiniAN and CalmAn have been developed to convert Ca2+ visual signals to numerical information, collectively referred to as CalV2N. However, substantial challenges remain in analyzing the large datasets generated by CalV2N, particularly in integrating data streams, evaluating CalV2N output quality, and reliably and efficiently identifying Ca2+ transients. In this study, we introduce CalTrig, an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to address these challenges at the post-CalV2N stage of data processing. CalTrig integrates multiple data streams, including Ca2+ imaging, neuronal footprints, Ca2+ traces, and behavioral tracking, and offers capabilities for evaluating the quality of CalV2N outputs. It enables synchronized visualization and efficient Ca2+ transient identification. We evaluated four machine learning models (i.e., GRU, LSTM, Transformer, and Local Transformer) for Ca2+ transient detection. Our results indicate that the GRU model offers the highest predictability and computational efficiency, achieving stable performance across training sessions, different animals and even among different brain regions. The integration of manual, parameter-based, and machine learning-based detection methods in CalTrig provides flexibility and accuracy for various research applications. The user-friendly interface and low computing demands of CalTrig make it accessible to neuroscientists without programming expertise. We further conclude that CalTrig enables deeper exploration of brain function, supports hypothesis generation about neuronal mechanisms, and opens new avenues for understanding neurological disorders and developing treatments.

">Distinct expression profile reveals glia involvement in the trigeminal system attributing to post-traumatic headache</a></h4>

              
                Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is a common comorbid symptom affecting at least one-third of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While neuroinflammation is known to contribute to the development of PTH, the cellular mechanisms in the trigeminal system crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of PTH remain unclear. A non-invasive repetitive mTBI (4 times with a 24-hour interval) was induced in male mice and effect of mTBI was tested on either bregma or pre-bregma position on the head. Periorbital allodynia and spontaneous pain behavior were assessed using von Frey test and grimace score, respectively. Quantitative PCR was used to assess extent of mTBI pathology. RNA sequencing was performed to obtain transcriptomic profile of the trigeminal ganglion (TG), trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) at 7 days post-TBI. Subsequently, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to examine mRNA and protein expression of glia specific markers and pain associated molecules. The repetitive impacts at the bregma, but not pre-bregma site led to periorbital hypersensitivity, which was correlated with enhanced inflammatory gene expression in multiple brain regions. RNA sequencing revealed mTBI induced distinct transcriptomic profiles in the peripheral TG and central Sp5C and PAG. Using gene set enrichment analysis, positive enrichment of non-neuronal cells in the TG and neuroinflammation in the Sp5C were identified to be essential in the pathogenesis of PTH. In situ assays also revealed that gliosis of satellite glial cells in the TG and astrocytes in the Sp5C were prominent days after injury. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study revealed a close interaction between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes correlating with increased calretinin interneurons in the Sp5C. Transcriptomics analysis indicated that non-neuronal cells in peripheral TG and successive in situ assays revealed that glia in the central Sp5C are crucial in modulating headache-like symptoms. Thus, selective targeting of glia cells can be a therapeutic strategy for PTH attributed to repetitive mTBI.

">Dissociable after-effects of prosocial acts: Effort is costly for others but valued for self</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behavior requires effort, yet people are often reluctant to exert effort for others' benefit. However, the manner in which effort exertion affects subsequent reward evaluation during prosocial acts remains elusive. Here, we leveraged the temporal precision of electroencephalography, along with a paradigm that independently manipulated effort and reward for self and another person, to uncover the neural mechanism underlying the reward after-effect of effort expenditure during prosocial acts. We found a dissociable reward after-effect between self-benefitting and other-benefitting effort. When the beneficiary was oneself, the reward positivity (RewP) became more positive as effort increased, indicating an effort-enhancement effect. In contrast, when the beneficiary was others, the RewP became less positive as effort increased, demonstrating an effort-discounting effect. Moreover, this dissociation occurred only when reward system was activated and was independent of performance evaluation. Our finding provides novel insights into how prior effort expenditure shape reward evaluation during prosocial behavior.

">Dopamine activity encodes the changing valence of the same stimulus in conditioned taste aversion paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Mesolimbic dopamine encoding of non-contingent rewards and reward-predictive cues has been well established. Considerable debate remains over how mesolimbic dopamine responds to aversion and in the context of aversive conditioning. Inconsistencies may arise from the use of aversive stimuli that are transduced along different neural paths relative to reward or the conflation of responses to avoidance and aversion. Here, we made intraoral infusions of sucrose and measured how dopamine and behavioral responses varied to the changing valence of sucrose. Pairing intraoral sucrose with malaise via injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) caused the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which rendered the typically rewarding taste of sucrose aversive upon subsequent re-exposure. Following CTA formation, intraoral sucrose suppressed the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTADA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release. This pattern of dopamine signaling after CTA is similar to intraoral infusions of innately aversive quinine and contrasts with that to sucrose when it was novel or not paired with LiCl. Dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity to intraoral sucrose and predicted home cage sucrose preference. Further, dopamine responses scaled with the strength of the CTA, which was increased by repeated LiCl pairings and weakened through extinction. Thus, the findings demonstrate differential dopamine encoding of the same taste stimulus according to its valence, which is aligned to distinct behavioral responses.

">Biologically grounded brain-on-chip model identifies selective topographic reorganization within hyperexcitable neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics has revolutionized our understanding of brain function by emphasizing the importance of neural networks and their topographical organization. Corticostriatal circuits, which play a critical role in cognition and emotion, follow a precise topographic architecture essential for integrating and processing cortical information within the basal ganglia. Disruptions to this connectivity are often implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. However, studying network disruptions in vivo presents significant challenges due to their intricate architecture and early developmental onset. To address this, we employed a brain-on-chip microfluidic platform to recreate a biologically relevant model of topographically organized corticostriatal networks. By mimicking the directional control of neuronal projections using Tesla valve-inspired microchannels, we demonstrate that genetic perturbations affecting neuronal excitability during development lead to selective alterations of local versus long-range network topology, resulting in the formation of new convergent nodes. This model offers critical insights into how early perturbations contribute to circuit-specific pathologies, providing a valuable tool for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and advancing therapeutic strategies.

">Quantitative 2D J-resolved metabolite-cycled semiLASER spectroscopy of metabolites and macromolecules in the human brain at 9.4 T</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: While two-dimensional (2D) in vivo spectroscopy yields rich information and has been successfully used in clinical trials, it requires a localization scheme that minimizes the impact of chemical shift displacement on J-coupling evolution, a robust frequency drift correction and dedicated processing and quantification methods. Considering these needs this study demonstrates a novel data acquisition and an analysis pipeline to quantify 16 metabolites in mmol/kg in the human brain using a 2D J-resolved metabolite-cycled (MC) semiLASER localization sequence at 9.4 T in the human brain. Methods: Metabolite spectra were acquired in vivo using the newly developed J-resolved MC semiLASER localization sequence with maximum echo sampling (MES) at 9.4 T. In order to account for the underlying macromolecular (MM) spectra in the acquired metabolite spectra, J-resolved MM spectra were acquired using a double inversion recovery (DIR) J-resolved MC semiLASER. Spectral fitting was performed with ProFit 2.0 using a simulated basis set from VesPA tailored to 2D J-resolved semiLASER with MES. Finally, metabolite concentrations were calculated using internal water referencing. Results: Tissue concentrations for 16 metabolites in mmol/kg are reported after correcting for number of protons, tissue content, and relaxation effects of both water and metabolites at 9.4T. Quantification results of spectra considering 8 and 2 averages per TE did not show any significant differences. Conclusion: 2D spectra of metabolites acquired at 9.4T and 2D MMs acquired at any field strength are presented for the first time. Basis set simulation and quantification of metabolites for metabolite spectra acquired using maximum-echo-sampled 2D J-resolved semiLASER was performed for the first time. The sensitivity in the detection of J-coupled metabolites such as glutamine, glucose or lactate. At ultra-high field, the acquisition duration of 2D MRS can be also substantially reduced since only a very low number of averages per TE are needed.

">Oddball evoked deviant responses reflect complex context dependent expectations in mouse V1</a></h4>

              
                Evoked responses in the mouse primary visual cortex can be modulated by the temporal context in which visual inputs are presented. Oddball stimuli embedded in a sequence of regularly repeated visual elements have been shown to drive relatively large deviant responses, a finding that is generally consistent with the theory that cortical circuits implement a form of predictive coding. These results can be confounded by short-term adaptation effects, however, that make interpretation difficult. Here we use various forms of the oddball paradigm to disentangle temporal and ordinal components of the deviant response, showing that it is a complex phenomenon affected by temporal structure, ordinal expectation, and event frequency. Specifically, we use visually evoked potentials to show that deviant responses occur over a large range of time, lead to long-term plasticity in some cases, cannot be explained by a simple adaptation model, scale with predictability, and are modulated by violations of both first and second-order sequential expectations.

">Functional classification of tauopathy strains reveals the role of protofilament core residues.</a></h4>

              
                Distinct tau amyloid assemblies underlie diverse tauopathies but defy rapid classification. Cell and animal experiments indicate tau functions as a prion, as different strains propagated in cells cause unique, transmissible neuropathology after inoculation. Strain amplification requires compatibility of the monomer and amyloid template. We used cryo-EM to study one cell-based YFP-tagged strain, resolving its amyloid nature. We then used sequential alanine (Ala) substitution (scan) within tau repeat domain (RD) to measure incorporation to pre-existing tau RD-YFP aggregates. This robustly discriminated strains, defining sequences critical for monomer incorporation. We then created 3R/4R or 4R WT RD (aa 246-408) biosensors. Ala scan of recombinant tau seeds with the Alzheimer's Disease fold matched that of AD homogenate. We scanned 22 brain lysates comprising 4 tauopathies. This clustered cases by neuropathological syndrome, revealed the role of amino acids in protofilament folds, and allowed strain discrimination based on amino acid requirements for prion replication.

">Linking microscopy to diffusion MRI with degenerate biophysical models: an application of the Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH) framework</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical modelling of diffusion MRI (dMRI) is used to non-invasively estimate microstructural features of tissue, particularly in the brain. However, meaningful description of tissue requires many unknown parameters, resulting in a model that is often ill-posed. The Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH) framework was specifically designed to circumvent parameter fitting for ill-conditioned models when one is simply interested in interpreting signal changes related to some variable of interest. To understand the biological underpinning of some observed change in MR signal between different conditions, BENCH predicts which model parameter, or combination of parameters, best explains the observed change, without having to invert the model. BENCH has been previously used to identify which biophysical parameters could explain group-wise dMRI signal differences (e.g. patients vs. controls); here, we adapt BENCH to interpret dMRI signal changes related to continuous variables. We investigate how parameters from the dMRI standard model of white matter, with an additional sphere compartment to represent glial cell bodies, relate to tissue microstructure quantified from histology. We validate BENCH using synthetic dMRI data from numerical simulations. We then apply it to ex-vivo macaque brain data with dMRI and microscopy metrics of glial density, axonal density, and axonal dispersion in the same brain. We found that (i) increases in myelin density are primarily associated with an increased intra-axonal volume fraction and (ii) changes in the orientation dispersion derived from myelin microscopy are linked to variations in the orientation dispersion index. Finally, we found that the dMRI signal is sensitive to changes in glial cell soma in the WM, but that no parameter in the extended standard model was able to explain this observed signal change, suggesting model inadequacy.

">A novel method for harmonization of PET image spatial resolution without phantoms</a></h4>

              
                The most common approach for estimating the spatial resolution of PET images in multi-center studies typically uses Hoffman phantom data as a surrogate. Specifically, the phantom-based matching resolution approach assumes that scanned phantom PET images are well approximated by a ground truth, noise-free digital phantom convolved with a Gaussian kernel of unknown size. The size of the kernel is then estimated by an exhaustive search on the amount of blurring needed to match the smoothed digital phantom to a particular scanned phantom image. Unfortunately, Hoffman phantom images may not always be readily available, and phantom-based approaches may yield sub-optimal results. We propose a new, computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from the PET image itself. We generalized the so-called logarithmic intensity plots method to the 3D case to perform a spatial resolution estimation in both axial and in-plane directions of the PET images. The proposed approach was applied to two different cohorts. The first cohort consisted of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms coming from a Phase II clinical trial and includes different scanner models and/or orientation and grid reconstructions. The second cohort included beta-amyloid, FDG and tau PET images from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We obtained in-plane and axial resolution estimators that vary between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. In both cases, we obtained small across-subject variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also obtained a strong cross-tracer and longitudinal consistency in the spatial resolution estimators. Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate brain phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other image modalities, such as SPECT.

">Mental Effort and Counterfactuals Modulate Language Understanding: ERP Evidence in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between language and physical effort in older adults is a field that is scarcely explored in the literature associated with embodiment. An electrophysiological experiment was conducted to explore the modulation of two linguistic contexts: factual and counterfactual, in relation to physical and mental effort using electrophysiological components. 27 older adults (M = 70.34 years, SD = 4.82, 15 women and 12 men) read sentences on a computer screen and responded to an activation test. The results indicate that the linguistic, factual, and counterfactual contexts, as well as the embodiment parameter of mental effort modulate the understanding of language and participate with variable preponderance in different time windows. Furthermore, counterfactuality seems to facilitate the processing of high mental effort, and both factual and counterfactual language elicit the N400 component. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on embodied cognition by providing novel insights into the nuances of cognitive demands involved in language processing in aging population, paving the way for developing targeted interventions aimed at improving communication and cognitive well-being in older adults.

">Emergent glutamate & dopamine dysfunction in VPS35(D620N) knock-in mice and rapid reversal by LRRK2 inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The D620N variant in Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) causes autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinson's disease. VPS35 is a core subunit of the retromer complex that canonically recycles transmembrane cargo from sorting endosomes. Although retromer cargoes include many synaptic proteins, VPS35's neuronal functions are poorly understood. To investigate the consequences of the Parkinson's mutation, striatal neurotransmission was assessed in 1-, 3- & 6-month-old VPS35 D620N knock-in (VKI) mice. Spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked corticostriatal glutamate transmission was increased in VKI striatal spiny projection neurons by 6 months, when total striatal glutamate release, quantified by iGluSnFR imaging, showed similarities to wild-type. dLight imaging revealed robust increases in VKI striatal dopamine release by 6 months, which were reversed with acute ex vivo leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition. We conclude that increased glutamate and dopamine transmission in VKI mice progressively emerges in young-adulthood, and that dopamine dysfunction is likely the result of sustained, rapidly-reversible, LRRK2 hyperactivity.

">Neuronal activity regulating the dauer entry decision in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can choose between two alternative developmental trajectories. Larvae can either become reproductive adults or, under conditions of crowding or low food availability, enter a long-term, stress-resistant diapause known as the dauer stage. Previous studies showed that chemical signals from a secreted larval pheromone promote the dauer trajectory, and that their influence can be antagonised by increased availability of microbial food. The decision is known to be under neuronal control, involving both sensory and interneurons. To make an accurate decision, larvae must collect and compare complex patterns of environmental input over around 25 hours of development. The full composition of this circuit and the algorithm for decision-making are unknown. Here, we used cell-specific chemical silencing to systematically perturb several sensory and interneurons to further elucidate circuit composition. Our results suggest a role for gas-sensing neurons in regulating dauer entry. In addition, we quantitatively characterized the neuronal responses to food and pheromone inputs by measuring calcium traces from ASI and AIA neurons. We found that calcium in ASI increases linearly in response to food, and similarly decreases in response to pheromone, revealing a cellular site of antagonism between these key chemical inputs. Notably, the ASI response persists well beyond removal of the food stimulus, thus encoding a memory of recent food exposure. In contrast, AIA reports instantaneous food availability, and is unaffected by pheromone. We discuss how these findings may inform our understanding of this long-term decision-making process.

                TDP-43 mislocalization and pathology occurs across a range of neurodegenerative diseases, but the pathways that modulate TDP-43 in neurons are not well understood. We generated a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in iPSC line and performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference FACS-based screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 levels in neurons. A meta-analysis of our screen and publicly available screens identified both specific hits and pathways present across multiple screens, the latter likely responsible for generic protein level maintenance. We identified BORC, a complex required for anterograde lysosome transport, as a specific modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not mRNA, levels in neurons. BORC loss led to longer half-life of TDP-43 and other proteins, suggesting lysosome location is required for proper protein turnover. As such, lysosome location and function are crucial for maintaining TDP-43 protein levels in neurons.

">Complex motion trajectories are represented by a population code from the ensemble activity of multiple motion-sensitive descending interneurons in locusts</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive locust flight relies on rapid detection and processing of objects moving in the visual field. One identified neural pathway, comprised of the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), responds preferentially to approaching objects. The LGMD receives retinotopic inputs from ipsilateral ommatidia and generates spikes in a 1:1 ratio in the DCMD, which synapses contralaterally with multiple locomotion-related neurons. Other motion-sensitive neurons have also been identified in locusts but are not as well characterized. To better understand how locusts process visual information, we used multichannel neural recordings within a stimulus arena and presented various complex visual stimuli to investigate the neural encoding of complex object motion. We found multiple discriminated units that responded uniquely to visual motion and categorized the responses. More units responded to motion trajectories with a looming component, compared to translations across the visual field. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) of discriminated units revealed common trends that reflect the activity of neural ensembles. The numbers and types of common trends varied among motion trajectories. These results increase the understanding of complex visual motion processing in this tractable system.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that leads to decreased quality of life due to behavioral, motor, and cognitive impairments. Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by amyloid beta plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in retinal thickness. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that amyloid beta plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients. These results may also point to potential compensatory mechanisms that preserve function of visual pathways in the 5xFAD visual system.

">Investigation of the effect of physiological factors on resting-state and task-based functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the brain's functional network through functional connectivity (FC) is crucial for gaining deeper insights into brain functional mechanism and identifying a potential biomarker for diagnosing neurological disorders. Despite the development of various FC measures, their reliability under different conditions remains under-explored. Moreover, physiological noise can obscure true neural activity, and accordingly, introduce errors into FC patterns. This issue necessitates further investigation. In this study, we evaluate and compare the performance of various methods using Local Field Potential and Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent signals across different conditions. We also examine the impact of physiological artifacts on BOLD-FC results. Our comprehensive assessment covers multiple modalities of brain signals, diverse task paradigms, and varying noise levels. Our findings reveal that while Granger Causality-based methods exhibit significant limitations, particularly with BOLD data, multivariate techniques (e.g. partial correlation) demonstrate greater robustness in distinguishing between different types of connections within the network. Notably, our results indicate that physiological artifacts substantially affect FC values, leading to erroneous connectivity estimates, especially with bivariate methods. This research offers a foundational analysis of the effects of physiological artifacts on FC results and provides valuable insights for future studies.

">Hard-wired visual filters for environment-agnostic object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to variations in input domains, unlike biological brains which effectively adapt to environmental changes. Here, we demonstrate that hard-wired Gabor filters, replicating the structure of receptive fields in the brains early visual pathway, facilitate environment-agnostic object recognition without overfitting. Our approach involved fixing the pre-designed Gabor filters in the early layers of DNNs, preventing any alterations during training. Despite the restricted learning flexibility of this model, our networks maintained robust performance even under significant domain shifts, in contrast to conventional DNNs that typically fail in similar conditions. We found that our model effectively clustered identical classes across diverse domains, while conventional DNNs tend to cluster images by domain in the latent space. We observed that the fixed Gabor filters enabled networks to encode global shape information rather than local texture features, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.

">Topographic organization of bidirectional connections between the cingulate region (infralimbic area and anterior cingulate area, dorsal part) and the interbrain (diencephalon) of the adult male rat</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex [cingulate region (Brodmann, 1909) (CNG)] in the rat is a connectionally and functionally diverse structure. It harbors cerebral nuclei that use long-range connections to promote adaptive changes to ongoing behaviors. The CNG is often described across functional and anatomical gradients, a dorsal-ventral gradient being the most prominent. Topographic organization is a general feature of the nervous system, and it is becoming clear that such spatial arrangements can reflect connectional, functional, and cellular differences. Portions of the CNG are known to form reciprocal connections with cortical areas and thalamus; however, these connectional features have not been described in detail or mapped to standardized rat brain atlases. Here, we used co-injected anterograde (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin) and retrograde (cholera toxin B subunit) tracers throughout the CNG to identify zones of reciprocal connectivity in the diencephalon [or interbrain (Baer, 1837) (IB)]. Tracer distributions were observed using a Nissl-based atlas-mapping approach that facilitates description of topographic organization. This draft report describes CNG connections of the infralimbic area (Rose & Woolsey, 1948) (ILA) and the anterior cingulate area, dorsal part (Krettek & Price, 1977) (ACAd) throughout the IB. We found that corticothalamic connections are predominantly reciprocal, and that ILA and ACAd connections tended to be spatially segregated with minimal overlap. In the hypothalamus (Kuhlenbeck, 1927), we found dense and specific ILA-originating terminals in the following Brain Maps 4.0 atlas territories: dorsal region (Swanson, 2004) (LHAd) and suprafornical region (Swanson, 2004) (LHAs) of the lateral hypothalamic area (Nissl, 1913), parasubthalamic nucleus (Wang & Zhang, 1995) (PSTN), tuberal nucleus, terete part (Petrovich et al., 2001) (TUte), and an ill-defined dorsal cap of the medial mammillary nucleus (Gudden, 1881) (MM). We discuss these findings in the context of feeding behaviors.

">Integrated data from R405W desmin knock-in mice highlight alterations of mitochondrial function, protein quality control, and myofibrillar structure in the initial stages of myofibrillar myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mutations in the desmin gene cause skeletal myopathies and cardiomyopathies. The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathology induced by the expression of R405W mutant desmin in murine skeletal muscle tissue. Methods: A comprehensive characterization of the skeletal muscle pathology in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice was performed, employing grip strength, blood acylcarnitine and amino acid, histological, ultrastructural, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, ribosomal stalling, RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses. Results: Both hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice showed classical myopathological features of a myofibrillar myopathy with desmin-positive protein aggregation, degenerative changes of the myofibrillar apparatus, increased autophagic build-up, and mitochondrial alterations. Muscle weakness and increased blood concentrations of acylcarnitines and amino acids were only present in homozygous animals. During its translation, mutant desmin does not induce terminal ribosomal stalling. Analyses of RNA sequencing and proteomic data from soleus muscle of 3-month-old mice depicted 59 up- and 2 down-regulated mRNAs and 101 up- and 18 down-regulated proteins that were shared between the heterozygous and homozygous genotypes in the respective omics datasets compared to the wild-type genotype. Combined analysis of the omics data demonstrated 187 significantly dysregulated candidates distributed across four groups of regulation. A down-regulation on the mRNA and protein levels was observed for a multitude of mitochondrial proteins including essential proton gradient-dependent carriers. Up-regulation on both omics levels was present for the transcription factor Mlf1, which is a binding partner of protein quality control related Dnajb6. Down-regulated on mRNA but up-regulated on the protein level was the sarcomeric lesion marker Xirp2 (xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 2), whereas Ces2c (acylcarnitine hydrolase) was regulated in the opposite way. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the expression of mutant desmin results in a myofibrillar myopathy in hetero- and homozygous R405W desmin knock-in mice. Combined morphological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses helped to decipher the complex pattern of early pathological changes induced by the expression of mutant desmin. Our findings highlight the importance of major mitochondrial alterations, including essential proton gradient-dependent carriers as well as Dnajb6-related protein quality control and Xin-related myofibrillar damage, in the molecular pathogenesis of desminopathies.

">Dynamic functional adaptations during touch observation in autism: Connectivity strength is linked to attitudes towards social touch and social responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Autistic adults often experience differences in social interactions involving physical contact. Brain imaging studies suggest that these differences may be related to atypical brain responses to social-affective cues, affecting both the experience of receiving touch and observing it in others. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical responses are limited to specific brain regions or represent broader alterations in brain connectivity. The current study investigated how the functional network architecture is modulated during touch observation associated with autism and explored the extent to which changes in this architecture are associated with individual differences in social touch preferences and social responsiveness. By integrating generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis with independent component analysis (ICA), the current study analyzed existing fMRI datasets, in which 21 autistic and 21 non-autistic male adults viewed videos of social and nonsocial touch while undergoing MRI scans. A gPPI analysis of pre-defined regions of interest revealed that autistic adults exhibited increased connectivity between sensory and social brain regions. The strength of some of these connections was positively associated with a higher preference for social touch and greater social responsiveness, suggesting neural compensatory mechanisms that may help autistic adults better understand the meaning of touch. At the level of large-scale brain networks extracted using ICA, atypical connectivity was predominantly observed between the sensorimotor network and other networks involved in social-emotional processing. Increased connectivity was observed in the sensorimotor network during nonsocial touch, suggesting that embodied simulation, the process by which individuals internally simulate touch experience of others in this context, may be more engaged when observing human-object interactions than during human-to-human touch in autism. This study reveals atypical context-dependent modulation of functional brain architecture associated with autism during touch observation, suggesting that challenges in recognizing and using affective touch in social interactions may be associated with altered brain connectivity. Neural compensatory mechanisms in autistic individuals who enjoy social touch and show higher social responsiveness may function as adaptive social responses. However, these compensations appear to be limited to specific brain regions, rather than occurring at the level of large-scale brain networks.

">The utility of explainable A.I. for MRI analysis: Relating model predictions to neuroimaging features of the aging brain</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Deep learning models highly accurately predict brain-age from MRI but their explanatory capacity is limited. Explainable A.I. (XAI) methods can identify relevant voxels contributing to model estimates, yet, they do not reveal which biological features these voxels represent. In this study, we closed this gap by relating voxel-based contributions to brain-age estimates, extracted with XAI, to human-interpretable structural features of the aging brain. Methods: To this end, we associated participant-level XAI-based relevance maps extracted from two ensembles of 3D-convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) that were trained on T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images of 2016 participants (age range 18-82 years), respectively, with regional cortical and subcortical gray matter volume and thickness, perivascular spaces (PVS) and water diffusion-based fractional anisotropy of main white matter tracts.Results: We found that all neuroimaging markers of brain aging, except for PVS, were highly correlated with the XAI-based relevance maps. Overall, the strongest correlation was found between ventricular volume and relevance (r = 0.69), and by feature, temporal-parietal cortical thickness and volume, cerebellar gray matter volume and frontal-occipital white matter tracts showed the strongest correlations with XAI-based relevance. Conclusion: Our ensembles of 3D-CNNs took into account a plethora of known aging processes in the brain to perform age prediction. Some age-associated features like PVS were not consistently considered by the models, and the cerebellum was more important than expected. Taken together, we highlight the ability of end-to-end deep learning models combined with XAI to reveal biologically relevant, multi-feature relationships in the brain.

">Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe regulate visual attention</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention enhances the neural representation of salient stimuli within the visual cortex. It is generally thought that this enhancement is driven by glutamatergic feedback from frontal cortical areas. Here we report the unexpected observation that dorsal raphe (DR) derived serotonin (5HT) controls visual attention. We developed a behavioral model that captured the way mice allocated attention to cued and uncued visual locations and features. Simultaneous photometry showed reduced DR activity when mice deployed attention to the cued locations and features, whereas high DR activity was observed when mice were less attentive. Optogenetic excitation of DR-5HT neurons impaired attention to the cue and degraded behavioral performance, while optogenetic suppression improved attention and performance. A genetically encoded sensor of 5HT release showed reduced 5HT levels in visual cortex when mice attend and detect stimuli. These results demonstrate that DR-5HT neurons are members of the brain's attentional circuit and suggest that 5HT is a novel biological carrier of visual attention.

">Hierarchy of prediction errors shapes the learning of context-dependent sensory representations</a></h4>

              
                How sensory information is interpreted depends on context. Yet, how context shapes sensory processing in the brain remains elusive. To investigate this question, we combined computational modeling and in vivo functional imaging of cortical neurons in mice during reversal learning of a tactile sensory discrimination task. During learning, layer 2/3 somatosensory neurons enhanced their response to reward-predictive stimuli, explainable as gain amplification from apical dendrites. Reward-prediction errors were reduced and confidence in the outcome prediction increased. Upon rule reversal, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, through disinhibitory VIP interneurons, encoded a context-prediction error, signaling a loss of confidence. The hierarchy of prediction errors in cortical areas is mirrored in top-down signals modulating apical activity in the primary sensory cortex. Our model explains how contextual changes are detected in the brain and how errors in different cortical regions interact to reshape and update the sensory representation.

">UBE3A reinstatement restores behavior and proteome in an Angelman Syndrome mouse model of Imprinting Defects</a></h4>

              
                Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with only symptomatic treatment currently available. Besides mutations within the UBE3A gene, AS is caused by deletions, imprinting center defects (mICD) or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD). Current mouse models are Ube3a-centric and do not address expression changes of other 15q11-q13 genes on AS pathophysiology. Here, we studied a mouse line that harbors a mutation affecting the AS-PWS imprinting center, hence modeling mICD/UPD AS subtypes. mICD mice showed significant reduction in UBE3A protein, bi-allelic expression of Ube3a-ATS and Mkrn3-Snord115 gene cluster, leading to robust AS behavioral deficits and proteome alterations similar to Ube3aKO mice. Genetic UBE3A overexpression in mICD mice, mimicking therapeutic strategies that effectively activate the biallelic silenced Ube3a gene, resulted in a complete rescue of all behavioral and proteome alterations. Subsequently, treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to directly activate the biallelic silenced Ube3a gene in mICD mice also resulted in efficient reinstatement of UBE3A, alongside a partial rescue of behavioral phenotypes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that UBE3A loss is the primary factor underlying AS phenotypes in the mICD/UPD mouse model, and also corroborate that UBE3A reinstatement is an attractive therapeutic strategy for mICD/UPD AS individuals.

">Proximity proteomics reveals a co-evolved LRRK2-regulatory network linked to centrosomes</a></h4>

              
                The Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) not only plays a vital role in familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) but is also considered as a risk factor for idiopathic PD. For these reasons, LRRK2 is considered a promising drug target for PD treatment. Its multi-domain architecture enables a fine-tuned regulation of its biological function by orchestrating intra- and inter-molecular interactions. At the same time, it offers multiple targetable epitopes for fine-tuned modulation of its deregulated kinase activity caused by pathogenic risk variants. Here, we present BioID proximity proteomes of LRRK2 revealing new interactors, which we further characterized by a novel evolutionary and structural bioinformatics pipeline. Co-evolutionary analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified a structural and functional module enriched in cytoskeletal components linked to the centrosome and microtubules. Likely co-evolved with LRRK2 within this cluster is CYLD, a K-63 selective ubiquitin deubiquitinase which we found to stabilize LRRK2. Furthermore, structural prediction of binary interactions via AlphaFold-multimer revealed distinct groups of interactors engaging with LRRK2 dependent on specific conformations and epitopes. We found two distinct groups engaging with LRRK2 either in an N-terminal closed ("locked") or open ("unlocked") conformation, both of which are associated with specific structurally defined interfaces and biological processes. Furthermore, we identified distinct changes in the LRRK2 proximity proteome induced by the type I kinase inhibitor MLi-2 or by co-expression of the LRRK2 upstream effector RAB29. Dependent on its state of activity and conformation, these functional state-specific protein interactions link LRRK2 to distinct cellular sub-compartments, including centriolar satellites as well as vesicular sub-compartments.

">Irregular light schedules induce alterations on daily rhythms and gene expression in mice</a></h4>

              
                Synchronization of internal biological rhythms with external light-dark cycles is crucial for proper function and survival of the organisms, however modern life often imposes irregular light exposure, disrupting these internal clocks. This study investigated the effects of short-term shifted light-dark cycles on mice rhythmicity, and whether these alterations trigger molecular or behavioral changes. We evaluated locomotor activity, different behavioral domains and gene expression in the hypothalamus and medial prefrontal cortex. Despite non prominent behavioral impairments, such as anxiety or cognitive deficits, we observed a notable simplification in the locomotor activity patterns of the mice subjected to disrupted light-dark cycles. Molecular alterations included dysregulations in oscillations of core clock genes (Cry2, Per2) and disruptions in expression of genes involved in neuroplasticity, motivation, and stress responses, including GluA1, Crhr2, and Vip in both studied brain areas. Our study reveals that even brief light cycle shifts can disrupt circadian regulation at the molecular level, despite minimal behavioral changes. This molecular-behavioral discrepancy may suggest a complex adaptive response to drastic short-term light perturbations. Understanding the complex interplay between external light cues and internal biological rhythms regulation is crucial for mitigating the negative consequences of irregular light exposure on physiological processes and overall well-being.

                Background Children’s use of social media has increased significantly over the past decade. As a result, they are susceptible to smartphone addiction. In particular, parents' and children's well-being and behaviors are negatively affected by smartphone addiction. Such addiction likely affects both physical performance and lifestyle. Adolescents utilize their smartphones while performing other tasks. The secondary task might divert attention away from the primary task. Reaction time is the combination of brain processing and muscular movement. Texting or communicating on a smartphone while performing another task may affect reaction time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of smartphone use on reaction time in undergraduate students who were addicted to smartphones. Methods The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to assign 64 undergraduate students to the smartphone addiction group (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The reaction time (RT) of an organism is used to determine how rapidly it responds to stimuli. All participants were examined on the RT test under three conditions: no smartphone use (control), texting, and chatting on a smartphone. Participants were questioned by smartphone through text message or chat with the support of a researcher during the texting and conversation conditions. While responding to the questions, the participant was administered an RT test. Results The results showed that smartphone addiction tends to have a reduced influence on reaction time when compared to the control group. Also, texting or conversing on a smartphone while doing other work had a substantial impact on reaction time in the undergraduates. Conclusions Combining smartphone use with other activities tends to reduce undergraduate students' reaction time.

                Background Human activity recognition poses a complex challenge in predicting individuals’ movements from raw sensor data using machine learning models. This paper explores the application of six prominent machine learning techniques – decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks – to enhance the accuracy of human activity detection for e-health systems. Despite previous research efforts employing data mining and machine learning, there remains room for improvement in performance. The study focuses on predicting activities such as walking, standing, laying, sitting, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Methods The research employs six machine learning algorithms to recognize human activities, including decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks. Results Evaluation of the human activity recognition dataset reveals that the random forest classifier, CNN, GRN and neural network yield promising results, achieving high accuracy. However, Naïve Bayes falls short of satisfying outcomes. Conclusions The study successfully classifies activities like SITTING, STANDING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, and WALKING_UPSTAIRS with a remarkable accuracy of 98%. The contribution lies in the thorough exploration of machine learning techniques, with neural networks emerging as the most effective in enhancing human activity recognition. The findings showcase the potential for advanced applications in e-health systems and beyond.

                Background Early-life food consumption patterns may affect children’s health by increasing susceptibility to developing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Aims To evaluate Jordanian children and adolescents’ energy and macronutrient intake and how closely they adhere to dietary recommendations. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from Jordan’s Population-based Food Consumption Survey, a household population-based study conducted in Jordan between 2021 and 2022 (561 children and adolescents 8-19 years). Dietary intake was assessed using the two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall methods (24-h DR). The estimated food group and nutrient intakes were compared to nutritional recommendations, including MyPlate dietary guidelines. Results The prevalence of overweight/obese individuals based on body mass index (BMI) was 44%, and the average waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was 24.7%. Compared to MyPlate dietary guidelines, children and adolescents had a higher added sugar intake (57g/day). Also, consuming vegetables, fruits, and dairy fell short of MyPlate dietary guidelines. The total discretionary calorie intake in children and adolescents was approximately one-third of the total energy intake. Conclusion The food consumption of Jordanian children and adolescents includes high intakes of discretionary calories, with a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was elevated compared to international norms.

                Background: Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results: Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions: This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.133, p = 0.000). Academic stress was not significantly related to social support (β = 0.128, p = 0.066) and self-efficacy (β = 0.075, p = 0.099). However, both social support (β = 0.059, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.838, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.070, CI [-0.036, 0.197], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.063, CI [0.054, 0.218], p = 0.097). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Maintaining short-term planning aligned with the ultimate long-term plan is challenging. This requires many details to be modelled on a daily or weekly basis to reach this target. Short-term planning is more challenging than medium- and long-term planning because it deals with uncertainties, which increases the gap between medium- and long-term plans. Short-term mine planning teams are expected to identify and manage potential risks to mitigate them, and eventually achieve the long-term objective of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). Very few studies have identified the problems that exist in short-term mine planning and provided technical solutions to overcome them for open-pit mines. One of the complexities associated with short-term planning is the creation of polygons or mining cuts by clustering before optimizing and scheduling the plan to reduce the computational expense of mine planning models. The primary objective of this study is to review the latest papers describing short-term mine planning challenges and technical solutions proposed to optimize mine planning for open-pit mines.

                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (=(1–ν 2)c 2)-1⁄2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

                Background Outpatient services were a major aspect of hospital healthcare, primarily due to the prevalent inclination of individuals to seek efficient and expedient treatment options that could be provided within a single day. In this context, the experience of head nurses played a crucial role in providing optimum nursing care under supervision. This study aimed to explore the experience of head nurses in supervising nursing staff in the outpatient department. Method this study used a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology design, and the participants were selected using the purposive sampling method. Result This study recruited a total of 20 head nurses in public and private hospitals in West Sumatra province. The FGD data were analyzed and coded using a total of 102 nodes, which were then used to generate 5 themes and 16 subthemes. The five major themes included the knowledge of head nurses about supervision, the performance appraisal method, the feeling of head nurses when supervising, the supervisor support for supervision, and the expectations of head nurses. Conclusion Clinical supervision in the outpatient department was crucial for the success of nurses in delivering healthcare services. The study revealed that while supervision was essential, head nurses observed that it was often perceived as fault-finding by nursing staff, which could affect individual assessment scores and sometimes led to indifference towards the process.

                Background: Disparity in the esthetic perceptions between a patient and clinician could result in patient dissatisfaction with orthodontic treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the perceptions of a group of orthodontists, general dentists, and laypersons about the attractiveness of Indian facial profiles. Methods: In this study, a male and a female participants’ photographs and lateral cephalograms were digitally manipulated by inserting them into Dolphin software; we considered four soft tissue parameters at a nasolabial angle, upper lip E-line, lower lip E-line, and pg-pg’, so that 20 profiles were created for each model. A visual analog scale (VAS) along with a question about surgical correction opinion was given to 18 orthodontists, 18 general dentists, and 18 laypersons to score (1-5) from least to most attractive. Spearman’s rank correlation was computed to assess correlation, as well as ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey analysis to compare the mean scores, and Chi-square test to determine the opinion about surgical treatment. Results: There was an overall weak and negative correlation between the three groups, indicating that orthodontists attributed lower pleasantness scores to almost all the altered female and male facial profiles. Additionally, statistically significantly lower mean scores were attributed by orthodontists to many females and few male facial profiles. More orthodontists identified the need for surgical correction for a few severely distorted profiles but there was a statistically non-significant difference among the groups for most of the profiles. Conclusions: It was concluded that participants in the three groups had diverse concepts of facial attractiveness in all the parameters considered. Compared to general dentists and laypersons, orthodontists were much more precise, firmer, and meticulous in identifying a favorable or good-looking profile.

Solid tumors are characterized by complex interactions between the tumor, the immune system and the microenvironment. These interactions and intra-tumor variations have both diagnostic and prognostic significance and implications. However, quantifying the underlying processes in patient samples requires expensive and complicated molecular experiments. In contrast, H&E staining is typically performed as part of the routine standard process, and is very cheap. Here we present HIPI (H&E Image Interpretation and Protein Expression Inference) for predicting cell marker expression from tumor H&E images. We process paired H&E and CyCIF images taken from serial sections of colorectal cancers to train our model. We show that our model accurately predicts the spatial distribution of several important cell markers, on both held-out tumor regions as well as new tumor samples taken from different patients. Moreover, using only the tissue image morphology, HIPI is able to colocalize the interactions between different cell types, further demonstrating its potential clinical significance.

Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases, but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel modeling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. Subsequently, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99.97% and 32.78%, thus providing an 18.6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days, also aligning with the real case. We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity.

                <p>by Kevin Tsai, Zhen Zhou, Jiadong Yang, Zhiliang Xu, Shixin Xu, Roya Zandi, Nan Hao, Weitao Chen, Mark Alber</p>

Understanding the mechanisms of the cellular aging processes is crucial for attempting to extend organismal lifespan and for studying age-related degenerative diseases. Yeast cells divide through budding, providing a classical biological model for studying cellular aging. With their powerful genetics, relatively short cell cycle, and well-established signaling pathways also found in animals, yeast cells offer valuable insights into the aging process. Recent experiments suggested the existence of two aging modes in yeast characterized by nucleolar and mitochondrial declines, respectively. By analyzing experimental data, this study shows that cells evolving into those two aging modes behave differently when they are young. While buds grow linearly in both modes, cells that consistently generate spherical buds throughout their lifespan demonstrate greater efficacy in controlling bud size and growth rate at young ages. A three-dimensional multiscale chemical-mechanical model was developed and used to suggest and test hypothesized impacts of aging on bud morphogenesis. Experimentally calibrated model simulations showed that during the early stage of budding, tubular bud shape in one aging mode could be generated by locally inserting new materials at the bud tip, a process guided by the polarized Cdc42 signal. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the tubular bud could be stabilized during the late stage as observed in experiments in this work. The model simulation results suggest that the localization of new cell surface material insertion, regulated by chemical signal polarization, could be weakened due to cellular aging in yeast and other cell types, leading to the change and stabilization of the bud aspect ratio.

Deep learning methods, trained on the increasing set of available protein 3D structures and sequences, have substantially impacted the protein modeling and design field. These advancements have facilitated the creation of novel proteins, or the optimization of existing ones designed for specific functions, such as binding a target protein. Despite the demonstrated potential of such approaches in designing general protein binders, their application in designing immunotherapeutics remains relatively underexplored. A relevant application is the design of T cell receptors (TCRs). Given the crucial role of T cells in mediating immune responses, redirecting these cells to tumor or infected target cells through the engineering of TCRs has shown promising results in treating diseases, especially cancer. However, the computational design of TCR interactions presents challenges for current physics-based methods, particularly due to the unique natural characteristics of these interfaces, such as low affinity and cross-reactivity. For this reason, in this study, we explored the potential of two structure-based deep learning protein design methods, ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1, in designing fixed-backbone TCRs for binding target antigenic peptides presented by the MHC through different design scenarios. To evaluate TCR designs, we employed a comprehensive set of sequence- and structure-based metrics, highlighting the benefits of these methods in comparison to classical physics-based design methods and identifying deficiencies for improvement.

                <p>by Yutaro Kumagai</p>

Recent advances in measurement technologies, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have revolutionized our ability to acquire large amounts of omics-level data on cellular states. As measurement techniques evolve, there has been an increasing need for data analysis methodologies, especially those focused on cell-type identification and inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We have developed a new method named BootCellNet, which employs smoothing and resampling to infer GRNs. Using the inferred GRNs, BootCellNet further infers the minimum dominating set (MDS), a set of genes that determines the dynamics of the entire network. We have demonstrated that BootCellNet robustly infers GRNs and their MDSs from scRNA-seq data and facilitates unsupervised identification of cell clusters using scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hematopoiesis. It has also identified COVID-19 patient-specific cells and their potential regulatory transcription factors. BootCellNet not only identifies cell types in an unsupervised and explainable way but also provides insights into the characteristics of identified cell types through the inference of GRNs and MDS.

An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” (HBPs), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based <i>Thanzi La Onse</i> (TLO) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis (LCOA) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) releases the unusual terpene nucleoside 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd) to block lysosomal function and promote survival in human macrophages. Using conventional approaches, we found that genes <i>Rv3377c</i> and <i>Rv3378c</i>, but not <i>Rv3376</i>, were necessary for 1-TbAd biosynthesis. Here, we introduce linear models for mass spectrometry <i>(limms)</i> software as a next-generation lipidomics tool to study the essential functions of lipid biosynthetic enzymes on a whole-cell basis. Using <i>limms</i>, whole-cell lipid profiles deepened the phenotypic landscape of comparative mass spectrometry experiments and identified a large family of approximately 100 terpene nucleoside metabolites downstream of <i>Rv3378c</i>. We validated the identity of previously unknown adenine-, adenosine-, and lipid-modified tuberculosinol-containing molecules using synthetic chemistry and collisional mass spectrometry, including comprehensive profiling of bacterial lipids that fragment to adenine. We tracked terpene nucleoside genotypes and lipid phenotypes among <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTC) species that did or did not evolve to productively infect either human or nonhuman mammals. Although 1-TbAd biosynthesis genes were thought to be restricted to the MTC, we identified the locus in unexpected species outside the MTC. Sequence analysis of the locus showed nucleotide usage characteristic of plasmids from plant-associated bacteria, clarifying the origin and timing of horizontal gene transfer to a pre-MTC progenitor. The data demonstrated correlation between high level terpene nucleoside biosynthesis and mycobacterial competence for human infection, and 2 mechanisms of 1-TbAd biosynthesis loss. Overall, the selective gain and evolutionary retention of tuberculosinyl metabolites in modern species that cause human TB suggest a role in human TB disease, and the newly discovered molecules represent candidate disease-specific biomarkers.

                Research data management (RDM) is central to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open Science principles. Recognising the importance of RDM, ELIXIR Platforms and Nodes have invested in RDM and launched various projects and initiatives to ensure good data management practices for scientific excellence. These projects have resulted in a rich set of tools and resources highly valuable for FAIR data management. However, these resources remain scattered across projects and ELIXIR structures, making their dissemination and application challenging. Therefore, it becomes imminent to coordinate these efforts for sustainable and harmonised RDM practices with dedicated forums for RDM professionals to exchange knowledge and share resources. The proposed ELIXIR RDM Community will bring together RDM experts to develop ELIXIR’s vision and coordinate its activities, taking advantage of the available assets. It aims to coordinate RDM best practices and illustrate how to use the existing ELIXIR RDM services. The Community will be built around three integral pillars, namely, a network of RDM professionals, RDM knowledge management and RDM training expertise and resources. It will also engage with external stakeholders to leverage benefits and provide a forum to RDM professionals for regular knowledge exchange, capacity building and development of harmonised RDM practices, keeping in line with the overall scope of the RDM Community. In the short term, the Community aims to build upon the existing resources and ensure that the content of these remain up to date and fit for purpose. In the long run, the Community will aim to strengthen the skills and knowledge of its RDM professionals to support the emerging needs of the scientific community. The Community will also devise an effective strategy to engage with other ELIXIR structures and international stakeholders to influence and align with developments and solutions in the RDM field.

                We describe the case report of an Osteosarcoma patient, with a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, presenting with a pathological femoral fracture. The patient was treated with a multidisciplinary approach associating neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with excisional surgery. The femoral reconstruction consisted of a ``Capasquelet'' reconstruction combining an induced membrane and a vascularized fibula allograft allowing a good functional result with an early weight-bearing. We managed to complete our histological analysis in this patient, in order to evaluate the tumor vascularization. Indeed, using the syngeneic osteosarcoma MOS-J mouse model, we highlighted previously that CD31+/\ensuremath{\alpha}-SMA+ vessels may be indicators of vasculature normalization and therefore may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response. Thus, we search for its interest in this specific case as preliminary work. The aim was to assess the feasibility and technical validity of the vascularization analysis of a human osteosarcoma tumor specimen. Therefore, we propose an immunohistochemistry methodology  with multiplexed immunofluorescence to assess the vascularization as a promising marker in human osteosarcoma tissue.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To determine the prevalence and distribution of intracranial vessel occlusion identified on computed tomography (CT) or magnet resonance (MR) angiography and to explore its association with functional outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with AF with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent CT- or MR-angiography on admission (2014–2022). Multivariable regression was used to explore the association between intracranial vessel occlusion and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 10,164 patients (median age 81.5 years, 47.8% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission 6; 14.7% on a vitamin K antagonist [VKA], 27.5% on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC], 57.8% not receiving oral anticoagulation). Angiography showed intracranial vessel occlusion in 5,190 patients (51.1%), affecting the anterior cerebral circulation in 87.4%. Overall, 29.2% and 29.4% of patients received thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, respectively. The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 90 days was 60.6% and 42.7% in those with and without vessel occlusion, respectively. In multivariable analyses, vessel occlusion was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71–2.22) with consistent results in subgroups according to oral anticoagulation use (VKA, aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.40–2.80; DOAC, aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.83–3.03; none, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intracranial vessel occlusion is common in patients with AF with ischemic stroke, mainly affects the anterior circulation and is associated with poor functional outcome. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The gross domestic product (GDP) of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states can be used to determine their overall economic growth. In order to increase GDP, all emerging nations in Southeast Asia are stating to depend on foreign direct investment (FDI), the tourism industry, international visitors visiting ASEAN member nations banking credit, and low inflation rates. High inflation is a problem that developed and developing countries will definitely face. One of the problems faced by ASEAN member countries is that most of the member countries are in the developing country category. For ASEAN member countries, high inflation levels will encourage economic instability. GDP is less than optimal because of these classic problems in developing countries so that economic growth is not as planned. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which ASEAN established, is seen as a way to reduce unemployment, alleviate poverty by boosting the travel and tourism industry and increasing investment, as well as to offer or distribute credit to businesses at low interest rates in order to boost GDP. The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyze how the GDP of ASEAN member nations is affected by FDI, foreign visitors, bank credit, and inflation. s: We analyzed panel data for seven ASEAN members from 2002 to 2020. FDI, foreign tourists, banking credit, and inflation are the research factors examined as independent variables that have an impact on GDP, the dependent variable. Results The study’s findings indicate that while inflation has a large negative impact on GDP, FDI, foreign tourism, and bank credit have a considerable positive impact on GDP. Conclusions FDI, foreign tourists, bank credit, and inflation have a significant influence on GDP in ASEAN member countries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94898">An arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and its alternative recognition receptor MDA5 in RIG-I-lost teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <i>Miichthys miiuy</i>. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of <i>M. miiuy and Gallus gallus</i>, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92080">Neuro-evolutionary evidence for a universal fractal primate brain shape</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the <i>same</i> archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of <i>d</i><sub><i>f</i></sub> = 2.5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size (from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96028">Transcription factor condensates, 3D clustering, and gene expression enhancement of the MET regulon</a></h4>

              
                Some transcription factors (TFs) can form liquid–liquid phase separated (LLPS) condensates. However, the functions of these TF condensates in 3-Dimentional (3D) genome organization and gene regulation remain elusive. In response to methionine (met) starvation, budding yeast TF Met4 and a few co-activators, including Met32, induce a set of genes involved in met biosynthesis. Here, we show that the endogenous Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Recombinant Met4 and Met32 form mixed droplets with LLPS properties in vitro. In relation to chromatin, Met4 puncta co-localize with target genes, and at least a subset of these target genes is clustered in 3D in a Met4-dependent manner. A <i>MET3pr</i>-GFP reporter inserted near several native Met4-binding sites becomes co-localized with Met4 puncta and displays enhanced transcriptional activity. A Met4 variant with a partial truncation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) shows less puncta formation, and this mutant selectively reduces the reporter activity near Met4-binding sites to the basal level. Overall, these results support a model where Met4 and co-activators form condensates to bring multiple target genes into a vicinity with higher local TF concentrations, which facilitates a strong response to methionine depletion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84662">Variation in thermal physiology can drive the temperature-dependence of microbial community richness</a></h4>

              
                Predicting how species diversity changes along environmental gradients is an enduring problem in ecology. In microbes current theories tend to invoke energy availability and enzyme kinetics as the main drivers of temperature-richness relationships. Here we derive a general empirically-grounded theory that can explain this phenomenon by linking microbial species richness in competitive communities to variation in the temperature-dependence of their interaction and growth rates. Specifically, the shape of the microbial community temperature-richness relationship depends on how rapidly the strength of effective competition between species pairs changes with temperature relative to the variance of their growth rates. Furthermore, it predicts that a thermal specialist-generalist tradeoff in growth rates alters coexistence by shifting this balance, causing richness to peak at relatively higher temperatures. Finally, we show that the observed patterns of variation in thermal performance curves of metabolic traits across extant bacterial taxa is indeed sufficient to generate the variety of community-level temperature-richness responses observed in the real world. Our results provide a new and general mechanism that can help explain temperature-diversity gradients in microbial communities, and provide a quantitative framework for interlinking variation in the thermal physiology of microbial species to their community-level diversity.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged in recent years as a strong candidate for the treatment of a range of difficulties faced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including cognitive, emotional, and social aspects. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a review that systematically examined the efficacy of MBIs for individuals with ASD and their caregivers. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our literature search was conducted within the MEDLINE database. We included in the review only longitudinal or intervention studies focusing mainly on mindfulness principles, while we excluded mixed intervention studies. We only included studies that explicitly utilized quantitative methodologies for evaluating the outcomes of the interventions, including mental health indices (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and assessments of cognitive and social skills (e.g., attention, prosociality). We conducted also a risk of bias assessment through the method of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for intervention studies ROBINS-I. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included in the review, and we grouped the studies by the targets of the interventions, i.e., adults (n = 12), children and adolescents (n = 9), caregivers and medical staff (n = 13), and combined intervention for both children/adolescents and their parents/caregivers (n 5). The reviewed papers seem to support the feasibility and utility of mindfulness interventions for persons with ASD and their caregivers, but any recommendations based on this body of evidence should be made with caution due to the overall low quality of the studies conducted so far. Conclusions: The review reveals a positive outcome, including the alleviation of psychological distress, reduced behavioral problems, and enhanced cognitive and social skills in individuals with ASD. Despite such promising results, the review notes a limitation in the scarcity of MBIs for young patients, emphasizing caution in universally endorsing the existing literature. Moreover, the results underline the urgency of the exploration of tailored interventions for different ASD subgroups, considering varying levels of autism, and expanding support to teachers in educational settings.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that impair posture and mobility, often leading to spasticity and joint contractures. Interventions like serial casting are commonly used to improve joint mobility and manage spasticity in children with CP. However, its effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of serial casting and ankle&amp;amp;ndash;foot orthoses (AFOs) on ANS responses during a virtual reality (VR) standing task, comparing these interventions with a barefoot condition. Thirty children with CP were randomized into three groups (n = 10 per group): serial casting, AFOs, and barefoot. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used to assess ANS responses across three phases: seated rest, VR task, and recovery. The results showed that the serial casting group exhibited higher sympathetic activity during rest compared to the other groups, but had a reduced sympathetic response during the VR task. Additionally, the serial casting group displayed a more pronounced parasympathetic rebound during recovery, similar to the orthoses and barefoot groups. While serial casting provides essential joint stability, it alters ANS response patterns, leading to heightened sympathetic activation at rest, without providing significant improvements in ANS behavior during physical activity.</p>

	<p>Background: Post-treatment side effects of chemotherapy can include cognitive deficits commonly known as Chemo-brain. The treatment of patients with Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancer, can induce depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa that has been identified as a possible therapeutic agent against many neurodegenerative disorders, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Tau-protein-induced neurodegeneration, and neuropathic pain. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether oral CBD administration could reduce DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors and alter the expression of mRNA associated with neuroinflammation. Methods: Female Long Evans Hooded rats received intraperitoneal injections of DOX (6 mg/kg) or the vehicle (0.9% saline) once a week for four weeks, followed by oral administration of CBD (10 mg/kg) three times a week for the same period. Results: CBD was significantly protective against DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, as measured by several behavioral tests. Furthermore, CBD improved DOX-induced alterations in the gene expression of biomarkers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: This provides insights into future studies on possible mechanisms by which DOX-induced cognitive dysfunction could be alleviated by CBD.</p>

	<p>Background: Decision-making is a highly complex process that depends on numerous cognitive functions, such as episodic memory. It is also influenced by aging. However, how changes in episodic memory with age contribute to changes in decision-making is not clear yet. Objective: This work aimed to examine the role of two memory processes, recollection and familiarity, in decision-making in ageing. Method: Thirty young adults and 30 older adults performed two episodic memory tasks: recognition, which allowed for the measurement of recollection and familiarity, and recall, which allowed for the measurement of recollection. In both tasks, they first viewed a series of pictures and then were asked to recognise or recall them respectively. They also performed an original scenario task based on situations inspired by everyday life, evaluating decision-making under conditions of either risk or ambiguity. In this task, participants were presented with short descriptions of situations requiring a decision and had to choose between two given options. Results: Lower performances was observed in recall and recognition tasks in older than in young adults. In the scenarios task, young adults sought significantly more risk and ambiguity than older adults. In both young and older adults, recollection and familiarity processes were involved differently in decision-making. The former is more involved in decision-making under ambiguity, and the latter in decision-making under risk. Conclusions: The results suggest that decision-making changes with age, but that the involvement of the episodic memory, familiarity and recollection processes, does not appear to vary with age.</p>

	<p>Background: Visual perceptual learning plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of how the human brain integrates visual cues to construct coherent perceptual experiences. The visual system is continually challenged to integrate a multitude of visual cues, including form and motion, to create a unified representation of the surrounding visual scene. This process involves both the processing of local signals and their integration into a coherent global percept. Over the past several decades, researchers have explored the mechanisms underlying this integration, focusing on concepts such as internal noise and sampling efficiency, which pertain to local and global processing, respectively. Objectives and Methods: In this study, we investigated the influence of visual perceptual learning on non-directional motion processing using dynamic Glass patterns (GPs) and modified Random-Dot Kinematograms (mRDKs). We also explored the mechanisms of learning transfer to different stimuli and tasks. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether visual perceptual learning based on illusory directional motion, triggered by form and motion cues (dynamic GPs), transfers to stimuli that elicit comparable illusory motion, such as mRDKs. Additionally, we examined whether training on form and motion coherence thresholds improves internal noise filtering and sampling efficiency. Results: Our results revealed significant learning effects on the trained task, enhancing the perception of dynamic GPs. Furthermore, there was a substantial learning transfer to the non-trained stimulus (mRDKs) and partial transfer to a different task. The data also showed differences in coherence thresholds between dynamic GPs and mRDKs, with GPs showing lower coherence thresholds than mRDKs. Finally, an interaction between visual stimulus type and session for sampling efficiency revealed that the effect of training session on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; performance varied depending on the type of visual stimulus, with dynamic GPs being influenced differently than mRDKs. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complexity of perceptual learning and suggest that the transfer of learning effects may be influenced by the specific characteristics of both the training stimuli and tasks, providing valuable insights for future research in visual processing.</p>

	<p>Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women (IPVAW) experience neuropsychological and cerebral changes, which have been linked to several tentative causal mechanisms, including elevated cortisol levels, psychopathological disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypoxic/ischemic brain damage, and medical conditions related to IPVAW. While these mechanisms and their effects on brain function and neuropsychological health are well-documented in other clinical populations, they manifest with unique characteristics in women affected by IPVAW. Specifically, IPVAW is chronic and repeated in nature, and mechanisms are often cumulative and may interact with other comorbid conditions. Thus, in light of existing literature on neuropsychological alterations in other populations, and recognizing the distinct features in women who experience IPVAW, we propose a new theoretical model&amp;amp;mdash;the Neuro-IPVAW model. This framework aims to explain the complex interplay between these mechanisms and their impact on cognitive and brain health in IPVAW victims. We anticipate that this theoretical model will be valuable for enhancing our understanding of neuropsychological and brain changes related to intimate partner violence, identifying research gaps in these mechanisms, and guiding future research directions in this area.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by a complex interplay of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors that significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs). This systematic review synthesizes current research on the developmental predictors of SI in individuals with SZ, aiming to delineate the multifactorial etiology of suicide within this population. Methods: A comprehensive search across Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases identified 23 eligible studies, emphasizing the varied methodological approaches and the global distribution of research efforts. Results: These studies demonstrate a robust association between early life adversities, particularly childhood trauma such as physical neglect, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse, and the increased prevalence of SI and SAs in SZ. This review also highlights the significant genetic factors associated with the development of suicidality in SZ, raising the possibility that polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and neurodevelopmental abnormalities may influence susceptibility to SI. Notably, family history of psychiatric conditions may exacerbate the risk of SI through both hereditary and environmental mechanisms. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic status and social support, are also implicated, underscoring the role of broader socio-environmental conditions influencing outcomes. Conclusions: This review supports the integration of biopsychosocial models in understanding SI in SZ, advocating for interventions addressing the complex interplay of risk factors and the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate the dynamic interactions between risk factors over time. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for developing targeted preventive strategies and enhancing the clinical management of SZ, aiming to reduce suicidality in this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Background: In the oddball paradigm, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is often associated with active cognitive responses, such as maintaining information in working memory or adapting response strategies. While some evidence points to the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in passive auditory deviance perception, a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal neurodynamics involved remains unclear. Methods: In this study, event-related optical signals (EROS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were simultaneously recorded for the first time over the prefrontal cortex using a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system, during passive auditory deviance perception in 12 right-handed young adults (7 women and 5 men). In this oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli (a 1500 Hz pure tone) elicited a negative shift in the N1 ERP component, related to mismatch negativity (MMN), and a significant positive deflection associated with the P300, compared to standard stimuli (a 1000 Hz tone). Results: We hypothesize that the DLPFC not only participates in active tasks but also plays a critical role in processing deviant stimuli in passive conditions, shifting from pre-attentive to attentive processing. We detected enhanced neural activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), at the same timing of the MMN component, followed by later activation at the timing of the P3a ERP component in the right MFG. Conclusions: Understanding these dynamics will provide deeper insights into the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in evaluating the novelty or unexpectedness of the deviant stimulus, updating its cognitive value, and adjusting future predictions accordingly. However, the small number of subjects could limit the generalizability of the observations, in particular with respect to the effect of handedness, and additional studies with larger and more diverse samples are necessary to validate our conclusions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To assess spatial contrast sensitivity (CS) in suspected primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods: CS was measured using sinusoidal gratings of 4 cycles/degree. First, foveal and peripheral CS were assessed in 34 suspected POAG patients and compared with 71 and 28 age-matched healthy individuals for foveal and peripheral conditions, respectively. Second, foveal CS was assessed in 34 early POAG patients age-matched with suspected POAG patients. Analyses were performed considering two age ranges: Under and Over 50 y.o. Correlations were evaluated between CS and clinical parameters. Diagnostic accuracy was also analyzed. Results: Peripheral CS was lower in older suspected POAG patients (23.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.1) than the control group (39.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28.2) (p = 0.040). Foveal CS was reduced in suspected POAG participants (Under 50: 146.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 63.3; p = 0.004. Over 50: 110.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 65.0; p = 0.044) and in early POAG patients (Under 50: 141.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 72.6; p = 0.002. Over 50: 80.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 54.5 p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), both compared to the control group (Under 50: 213.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 66.2. Over 50: 138.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 71.7). CS was lower in early POAG than in POAG suspected in older patients (p = 0.042). Foveal CS was correlated with age (Early: p = 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.002) and with the cup&amp;amp;ndash;disc ratio only in early POAG patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Foveal CS had fair (AUC = 0.74) diagnostic accuracy for early POAG patients. Conclusions: CS in suspected POAG patients is lower than in healthy individuals. Our findings evidence the spatial vision loss before the onset of POAG.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the involvement of progressive brain alterations in epilepsy was recently suggested, individual patients&amp;amp;rsquo; trajectories of white matter (WM) disruption are not known. Methods: We investigated the disease progression patterns of WM damage and its associations with clinical metrics. We examined the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 155 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 270 age/gender-matched healthy controls, and we then calculated the average fractional anisotropy (FA) values within 20 WM tracts of the whole brain. We used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) program to detect the progression trajectory of FA changes and investigated its association with clinical parameters including onset age, disease duration, drug-responsiveness, and the number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Results: The SuStaIn algorithm identified a single subtype model in which the initial damage occurs in the ipsilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF), followed by damage in the forceps, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). This pattern was replicated when analyzing TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 50) and TLE with no lesions (n = 105) separately. Further-progressed stages were associated with longer disease duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a greater number of ASMs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: the disease progression model based on WM tracts may be useful as a novel individual-level biomarker.</p>

	<p>The acute levodopa challenge is widely used to distinguish Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In APSs, very few patients present a clinically relevant response to levodopa. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with atypical parkinsonism benefit from levodopa in any aspect of their multiple motor deficits despite the generally poor response. This retrospective study analyzed individual motor responses to the acute levodopa challenge using the MDS-UPDRS III in 47 PSP, 26 MSA, and 71 PD patients at Hannover Medical School. Despite the generally poor levodopa response in both PSP and MSA patients, bradykinesia and rigidity were the symptoms most notably affected by levodopa in PSP patients, while MSA patients experienced significant improvements in bradykinesia and action tremor. These findings underscore the variability in levodopa response among PSP and MSA patients and highlight the need for personalized treatment approaches in atypical parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) has undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting &amp;amp;beta;-Amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) accumulation, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-A&amp;amp;beta; and non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those already approved for the market to treat patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural decoding methods are often limited by the performance of brain encoders, which map complex brain signals into a latent representation space of perception information. These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for future directions in the field of neural decoding.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental health issues are increasingly prominent worldwide, posing significant threats to patients and deeply affecting their families and social relationships. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and delayed, indicating the need for an objective and effective early diagnosis method. Methods: To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight detection method for multi-mental disorders with fewer data sources, aiming to improve diagnostic procedures and enable early patient detection. First, the proposed method takes Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as sources, acquires brain rhythms through Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWT), and extracts their approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and sample entropy to establish the entropy-based matrix. Then, six kinds of conventional machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Decision Tree (DT), are adopted for the entropy-based matrix to achieve the detection task. Their performances are assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Concerning these experiments, three public datasets of schizophrenia, epilepsy, and depression are utilized for method validation. Results: The analysis of the results from these datasets identifies the representative single-channel signals (schizophrenia: O1, epilepsy: F3, depression: O2), satisfying classification accuracies (88.10%, 75.47%, and 89.92%, respectively) with minimal input. Conclusions: Such performances are impressive when considering fewer data sources as a concern, which also improves the interpretability of the entropy features in EEG, providing a reliable detection approach for multi-mental disorders and advancing insights into their underlying mechanisms and pathological states.</p>

	<p>Background: Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with urokinase offering a cost-effective alternative to newer agents like alteplase and tenecteplase, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of intravenous thrombolysis with urokinase for AIS in the clinical practice of stroke management, including the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of urokinase compared to other thrombolytic agents. Results: Urokinase, a first-generation thrombolytic drug, is a non-specific plasminogen activator that offers a cost-effective alternative. It has been used in clinical practice for over two decades to improve neurological outcomes in patients with AIS if administered within 6 h of ictus. Numerous studies have indicated that urokinase remains a viable option for patients who cannot access alteplase or tenecteplase because of economic constraints, time window limitations, availability, or other reasons. Conclusions: In low- and middle-income countries, urokinase is a cost-effective alternative thrombolytic drug. High-level evidence-based medical research is therefore urgently needed to confirm that urokinase is not inferior to new-generation thrombolytic drugs, and to assess whether it may even be superior in some patient populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits following ischemic stroke significantly impair quality of life, highlighting the need for effective interventions. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended N-Pep-12 dietary supplementation in enhancing cognitive recovery post-stroke. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled study, 106 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke were enrolled to receive either 90mg N-Pep-12 or no supplementation daily for 360 days and were followed-up for 360 days. Cognitive function and emotional well-being were assessed using established neuropsychological scales at baseline, 90 days, and 360 days post-stroke. Safety was monitored through adverse events and mortality rates. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the N-Pep-12 group compared to controls, particularly in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at both 90 and 360 days, and in the Digit Symbol Coding scores at 360 days, suggesting enhanced cognitive recovery with extended N-Pep-12 supplementation. A linear regression for a composite outcome analysis at day 360 further confirmed the efficacy of N-Pep-12 in contributing to cognitive improvement. Safety profiles were favorable, with no significant adverse effects attributed to N-Pep-12. Conclusions: Extended dietary supplementation with N-Pep-12 appears to offer a safe and effective approach to support cognitive recovery in ischemic stroke survivors. These findings underscore the potential of the supplement as an add-on intervention for managing post-stroke cognitive impairments.</p>

	<p>Objectives. There is a significant correlation between EEG microstate and the neurophysiological basis of mental illness, brain state, and cognitive function. Given that the unclear relationship between network dynamics and different microstates, this paper utilized microstate, brain network, and control theories to understand the microstate characteristics of short-term memory task, aiming to mechanistically explain the most influential microstates and brain regions driving the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We identified each microstate and analyzed the microstate abnormalities in schizophrenia patients during short-term memory tasks. Subsequently, the network dynamics underlying the primary microstates were studied to reveal the relationships between network dynamics and microstates. Finally, using control theory, we confirmed that the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in schizophrenia patients are driven by specific microstates and brain regions. Results. The frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly, but the left frontal lobe of microstate B increased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the easy-to-reach states. However, the frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the hard-to-reach states. Microstate D showed that the right-frontal activity had a higher priority than the left-frontal, but microstate B showed that the left-frontal priority decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when changes occur in the synchronization state of the brain. Conclusions. In conclusion, microstate D may be a biomarker candidate of brain abnormal activity during the states transitions in schizophrenia, and microstate B may represent a compensatory mechanism that maintains brain function and exchanges information with other brain regions. Microstate and brain network provide complementary perspectives on the neurodynamics, offering potential insights into brain function in health and disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in prison populations and offenders. Due to misleading headlines and highly publicized criminal cases, the belief that autistic individuals are more prone to commit crimes has spread among the general population, also leading to increasing research on this matter. Aims: In this context, this narrative review aimed to analyze the available scientific literature on the bi-directional link between ASD and criminal behaviors and to assess the key characteristics of eventual ASD offenders, including sociodemographic data, comorbidities, crime-related features, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Results: Our review highlighted that the available studies lack methodological rigor and present controversial results. Overall, the current state of research does not support any definitive correlation between ASD or autistic traits and the predisposition to engage in criminal conduct. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>The delivery of nutrients to the brain is provided by a 600 km network of capillaries and microvessels. Indeed, the brain is highly energy demanding and, among a total amount of 100 billion neurons, each neuron is located just 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 &amp;amp;mu;m from a capillary. This vascular network also forms part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s stable environment by regulating chemical balance, immune cell transport, and blocking toxins. Typically, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) have low turnover, indicating a stable cerebrovascular structure. However, this structure can adapt significantly due to development, aging, injury, or disease. Temporary neural activity changes are managed by the expansion or contraction of arterioles and capillaries. Hypoxia leads to significant remodeling of the cerebrovascular architecture and pathological changes have been documented in aging and in vascular and neurodegenerative conditions. These changes often involve BMEC proliferation and the remodeling of capillary segments, often linked with local neuronal changes and cognitive function. Cerebrovascular plasticity, especially in arterioles, capillaries, and venules, varies over different time scales in development, health, aging, and diseases. Rapid changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occur within seconds due to increased neural activity. Prolonged changes in vascular structure, influenced by consistent environmental factors, take weeks. Development and aging bring changes over months to years, with aging-associated plasticity often improved by exercise. Injuries cause rapid damage but can be repaired over weeks to months, while neurodegenerative diseases cause slow, varied changes over months to years. In addition, if animal models may provide useful and dynamic in vivo information about vascular plasticity, humans are more complex to investigate and the hypothesis of glymphatic system together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques could provide useful clues in the future.</p>

	<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has gained attention owing to its involvement in various physiological functions, such as sleep&amp;amp;ndash;awake, feeding, and emotion, with its analgesic role being particularly significant. It is described as the &amp;amp;ldquo;pain inhibitory nucleus&amp;amp;rdquo; in the brain. The DRN has diverse projections from hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. In turn, the DRN is a major source of projections to diverse cortex, limbic forebrain thalamus, and the midbrain and contains highly heterogeneous neuronal subtypes. The activation of DRN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition neurons in the DRN are sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain. Recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits and cellular mechanisms in the DRN that are responsible for sensory modulation. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive review addressing the specific neuron types in the DRN involved in pain modulation. This review summarizes the function of specific cell types within DRN in the pain regulation, and aims to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain regulation in the DRN, ultimately offering insights for further exploration.</p>

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vascularitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any displacement of catheters’ tip from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be easily coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background The Wheat Crop ontology was created to annotate phenotypic experimental data (i.e. field and greenhouse measurements standardized and integrated in databases). The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts, suggesting difficulties in retaining recent graduates in academia and in the private sector. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study confirmed the challenges faced by doctoral graduates in integrating into non-academic job markets. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                <p>by Mengze Zhang, Xia Wang, Sanyi Tang</p>

Aedes mosquitoes, known as vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, pose significant risks to public health and safety. Modeling the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes requires comprehensive approaches due to the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and environmental factors. This study developed a model that couples differential equations with a neural network to simulate the dynamics of mosquito population, and explore the relationships between oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation. Data from nine cities in Guangdong Province spanning four years were used for model training and parameter estimation, while data from the remaining three cities were reserved for model validation. The trained model successfully simulated the mosquito population dynamics across all twelve cities using the same set of parameters. Correlation coefficients between simulated results and observed data exceeded 0.7 across all cities, with some cities surpassing 0.85, demonstrating high model performance. The coupled neural network in the model effectively revealed the relationships among oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation, aligning with biological patterns. Furthermore, symbolic regression was used to identify the optimal functional expression for these relationships. By integrating the traditional dynamic model with machine learning, our model can adhere to specific biological mechanisms while extracting patterns from data, thus enhancing its interpretability in biology. Our approach provides both accurate modeling and an avenue for uncovering potential unknown biological mechanisms. Our conclusions can provide valuable insights into designing strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases and developing related prediction and early warning systems.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome’s influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the “regular” composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012471">The role of training variability for model-based and model-free learning of an arbitrary visuomotor mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jordan A. Taylor</p>

A fundamental feature of the human brain is its capacity to learn novel motor skills. This capacity requires the formation of vastly different visuomotor mappings. Using a grid navigation task, we investigated whether training variability would enhance the flexible use of a visuomotor mapping (key-to-direction rule), leading to better generalization performance. Experiments 1 and 2 show that participants trained to move between multiple start-target pairs exhibited greater generalization to both distal and proximal targets compared to participants trained to move between a single pair. This finding suggests that limited variability can impair decisions even in simple tasks without planning. In addition, during the training phase, participants exposed to higher variability were more inclined to choose options that, counterintuitively, moved the cursor away from the target while minimizing its actual distance under the constrained mapping, suggesting a greater engagement in model-based computations. In Experiments 3 and 4, we showed that the limited generalization performance in participants trained with a single pair can be enhanced by a short period of variability introduced early in learning or by incorporating stochasticity into the visuomotor mapping. Our computational modeling analyses revealed that a hybrid model between model-free and model-based computations with different mixing weights for the training and generalization phases, best described participants’ data. Importantly, the differences in the model-based weights between our experimental groups, paralleled the behavioral findings during training and generalization. Taken together, our results suggest that training variability enables the flexible use of the visuomotor mapping, potentially by preventing the consolidation of habits due to the continuous demand to change responses.

                <p>by Jiaxin Jiang, Xiaona Meng, Yibo Wang, Ziqian Zhuang, Ting Du, Jing Yan</p>

Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes <i>CLEC4A</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>GPI</i>, <i>PMM2</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>IL7</i>, <i>ALDH3B1</i>, <i>AASS</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, <i>SEPINE1</i>, <i>PFKFB1</i>, <i>FTCD</i>, <i>TIMP1</i> and <i>GATM</i> were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p>by Ilaria Granata, Lucia Maddalena, Mario Manzo, Mario Rosario Guarracino, Maurizio Giordano</p>

Machine learning-based approaches are particularly suitable for identifying essential genes as they allow the generation of predictive models trained on features from multi-source data. Gene essentiality is neither binary nor static but determined by the context. The databases for essential gene annotation do not permit the personalisation of the context, and their update can be slower than the publication of new experimental data. We propose HELP (Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction), a computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes. Its double scope allows for identifying genes based on dependency or not on experimental data. The effectiveness of the labelling method was demonstrated by comparing it with other approaches in overlapping the reference sets of essential gene annotations, where HELP demonstrated the best compromise between false and true positive rates. The gene attributes, including multi-omics and network embedding features, lead to high-performance prediction of essential genes while confirming the existence of essentiality nuances.

                <p>by Cecile Le Sueur, Magnus Rattray, Mikhail Savitski</p>

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a proteome wide technology that enables unbiased detection of protein drug interactions as well as changes in post-translational state of proteins between different biological conditions. Statistical analysis of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves, describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). However, state-of-the-art models are restricted to sigmoidal melting behaviours while unconventional melting curves, representing up to 50% of TPP-TR datasets, have recently been shown to carry important biological information. We present a novel statistical framework, based on hierarchical Gaussian process models and named GPMelt, to make TPP-TR datasets analysis unbiased with respect to the melting profiles of proteins. GPMelt scales to multiple conditions, and extension of the model to deeper hierarchies (i.e. with additional sub-levels) allows to deal with complex TPP-TR protocols. Collectively, our statistical framework extends the analysis of TPP-TR datasets for both protein and peptide level melting curves, offering access to thousands of previously excluded melting curves and thus substantially increasing the coverage and the ability of TPP to uncover new biology.

The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway clears eukaryotic cells of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) or normal stop codons located in specific contexts. It therefore plays an important role in gene expression regulation. The precise molecular mechanism of the NMD pathway has long been considered to differ substantially from yeast to metazoa, despite the involvement of universally conserved factors such as the central ATP-dependent RNA-helicase Upf1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the yeast Upf1 bound to its recently identified but yet uncharacterized partner Nmd4, show that Nmd4 stimulates Upf1 ATPase activity and that this interaction contributes to the elimination of NMD substrates. We also demonstrate that a region of Nmd4 critical for the interaction with Upf1 in yeast is conserved in the metazoan SMG6 protein, another major NMD factor. We show that this conserved region is involved in the interaction of SMG6 with UPF1 and that mutations in this region affect the levels of endogenous human NMD substrates. Our results support the universal conservation of the NMD mechanism in eukaryotes.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

There is no exception in the demographics of elective surgery also. Like any other medical professionals, surgeons and post-graduates are redirected to the management of patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgeries, surgeon skills, and post-graduate training. Methods This prospective study was done among 320 participants through a 15-question online cross-sectional survey sent primarily to surgeons practicing in six states of India that were most affected by the pandemic according to recent statistics and also to surgeons in other states via email or other online messaging services carried out from June 2021 to July 2021. Results 320 surgeons participated from various states in India. Overall, 59.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a reduction in bed availability, 70.4% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of oxygen, 78.8% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of PPE kits, 60.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a delay in procurement of surgical implants and 64% of participants also agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the post-graduate teaching program. Conclusions All these factors showed significant p-values with statistical significance, thereby indicating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and healthcare delivery. The pandemic also had a significant impact on post-graduate training.

                The 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024) was part of the 2024 conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2024). Launched in 2000 and held yearly since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering open-source bioinformatics and open science. ISMB 2024 was held in Montréal, Canada, with an online participation option. A total of nearly 2000 people attended; about 200 people participated in BOSC sessions. Over the course of two days, BOSC covered a wide range of topics in open science and open source bioinformatics, including Data Analysis, Open Data, Visualization, Developer Tools and Libraries, Standards and Frameworks for Open Science, and Open AI/ML. Mélanie Courtot delivered an impactful first keynote with a perspective on how “The Data Shows We Need Better Data”. The second keynote speaker, Andrew Su, discussed “Open Data, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models.” BOSC ended with a panel, “Open Source AI/ML: A Game Changer for Bioinformatics?,” in which Lawrence Hunter and Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou joined BOSC’s keynote speakers as panelists. Immediately following BOSC, the CollaborationFest was held at Montréal’s University of Québec campus. First launched in 2010, CoFest is a collaborative work event held yearly around BOSC. This year’s CoFest included 42 participants who worked together on 10 projects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-50/v3?src=rss">Evidence for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from epidemiological data series [version 3; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York’s mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.

                The search for neural markers of depression remains challenging. Despite progress, neuroimaging results have generally not yielded actionable findings that could transform how we understand and treat this disorder. However, in a recent study, Lynch and colleagues identified enlargement of the frontrostriatal salience network as a reproducible, trait-like marker of depression.

                The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have captured the world’s attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence – for example, all the words in a sentence – into a long ‘encoding vector’ that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, ‘self-attention’ applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas, or multiple regions on the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable a temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle as that used in transformers.

                Antimicrobial resistance is responsible for an alarming number of deaths, estimated at 5 million per year. To combat priority pathogens, like <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, the development of novel therapies is of utmost importance. Understanding the molecular alterations induced by medications is critical for the design of multi-targeting treatments capable of eradicating the infection and mitigating its pathogenicity. However, the application of bulk omics approaches for unraveling drug molecular mechanisms of action is limited by their inability to discriminate between target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a multi-omics method to overcome the existing limitation. For the first time, the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay is utilized in bacteria in the PISA-Express format to link proteome solubility with different and potentially immediate responses to drug treatment, enabling us the resolution to understand target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a comprehensive method for understanding drug mechanisms and optimizing the development of multi-targeting antimicrobial therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95867">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to study inflammation-induced aberrant calcium transient</a></h4>

              
                Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commonly found in persons living with HIV (PLWH) even when antiretroviral therapy suppresses HIV viremia. However, studying this condition has been challenging because an appropriate animal model is not available. In this article, we studied calcium transient in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in culture to simulate the cardiomyocyte relaxation defect noted in PLWH and HFpEF and assess whether various drugs have an effect. We show that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-γ or TNF-α) impairs their Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum and that SGLT2 inhibitors, clinically proven as effective for HFpEF, reverse this effect. Additionally, treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants (like mito-Tempo) and certain antiretrovirals resulted in the reversal of the effects of these cytokines on calcium transient. Finally, incubation of hiPSC-CMs with serum from HIV patients with and without diastolic dysfunction did not alter their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decay time, indicating that the exposure to the serum of these patients is not sufficient to induce the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in vitro. Together, our results indicate that hiPSC-CMs can be used as a model to study molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated abnormal cardiomyocyte relaxation and screen for potential new interventions.

                The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation of the ACH.

                We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV <i>rules of return</i> generate conformationally defined domains observed by single-cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as RAD21 degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98739">Reproducible, data-driven characterization of sleep based on brain dynamics and transitions from whole-night fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the function of sleep requires studying the dynamics of brain activity across whole-night sleep and their transitions. However, current gold standard polysomnography (PSG) has limited spatial resolution to track brain activity. Additionally, previous fMRI studies were too short to capture full sleep stages and their cycling. To study whole-brain dynamics and transitions across whole-night sleep, we used an unsupervised learning approach, the Hidden Markov model (HMM), on two-night, 16 hr fMRI recordings of 12 non-sleep-deprived participants who reached all PSG-based sleep stages. This method identified 21 recurring brain states and their transition probabilities, beyond PSG-defined sleep stages. The HMM trained on one night accurately predicted the other, demonstrating unprecedented reproducibility. We also found functionally relevant subdivisions within rapid eye movement (REM) and within non-REM 2 stages. This study provides new insights into brain dynamics and transitions during sleep, aiding our understanding of sleep disorders that impact sleep transitions.

                Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and is characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity to stimuli and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli, affecting approximately 7–10% of the general population. However, current first-line drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids have limitations, including dose-limiting side effects, dependence, and tolerability issues. Therefore, developing new interventions for the management of NP is urgent. In this study, we discovered that the high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) at approximately 36 THz effectively alleviates NP symptoms in mice with spared nerve injury. Computational simulation suggests that the frequency resonates with the carbonyl group in the filter region of Kv1.2 channels, facilitating the translocation of potassium ions. In vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that HFTS reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex likely through enhancing the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and also the leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This research presents a novel optical intervention strategy with terahertz waves for the treatment of NP and holds promising applications in other nervous system diseases.

Classical theories propose that the motor system forms a single specification of the sequence as a whole, leading to the coarticulation of the different elements. In contrast, recent neural recordings challenge this idea and suggest independent execution of each element specified separately. Here, we show that separate or coarticulated sequences can result from the same task-dependent controller, without implying different representations in the brain. Simulations show that planning for multiple reaches simultaneously allows separate or coarticulated sequences depending on instructions about intermediate goals. Human experiments in a two-reach sequence task validated this model. Furthermore, in co-articulated sequences, the second goal influenced long-latency stretch responses to external loads applied during the first reach, demonstrating the involvement of the sensorimotor network supporting fast feedback control. Overall, our study establishes a computational framework for sequence production that highlights the importance of feedback control in this essential motor skill.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Meditation induces changes in the nervous system, which presumably underpin positive psychological and physiological effects. Such neural changes include alterations in the arousal fluctuation, as well as in infraslow brain activity (ISA, &amp;amp;lt;0.1 Hz). Furthermore, it is known that fluctuations of arousal over time correlate with the oscillatory phase of ISA. However, whether this arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlation changes after meditation practices remains unanswered.; Methods: The present study aims to address this question by analyzing a publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset recorded during meditation sessions in the groups of experienced meditators and novices. The arousal fluctuation is measured by galvanic skin responses (GSR), and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations are measured by phase synchronization between GSR and EEG ISAs.; Results: While both groups exhibit arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations, experienced meditators display higher correlations than novices. These increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations in experienced meditators manifest more clearly when oscillatory phase differences between GSR and EEG ISAs are either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians. As such, we further investigate the characteristics of these phase differences with respect to spatial distribution over the brain. We found that brain regions with the phase difference of either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians form distinct spatial clusters, and that these clusters are spatially correlated with functional organization estimated by the principal gradient, based on functional connectivity.; Conclusions: Since increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations reflect enhanced global organization of the central and autonomic nervous systems, our findings imply that the positive effects of meditation might be mediated by enhanced global organization of the nervous system.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This study investigates how traumatic injuries alter joint movements in the ankle and foot. We used a brain injury model in rats, focusing on the hippocampus between the CA1 and dentate gyrus. Materials and Methods: We assessed the dissimilarity factor (DF) and vertical displacement (VD) of the ankle and metatarsus joints before and after the hippocampal lesion. We analyzed joint movements in rats after the injury or in rats treated with resveratrol, exercise, or a combination of both. Results: Resveratrol facilitated the recovery of DF in both legs, showing improvements in the ankle and metatarsus joints on the third and seventh days post-injury. The hippocampal lesion affected VD in both legs, observed on the third or seventh day after the injury. Both exercise and resveratrol partially recovered VD in the ankle and metatarsus joints on these days. These effects may be linked to increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions: The study highlights the benefits of resveratrol and exercise in motor recovery following brain injury, suggesting their potential to enhance the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders affecting motor function and locomotion. These findings also suggest that resveratrol could offer a promising or complementary alternative in managing chronic pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic conditions, thus improving overall patient management.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research suggests that metalinguistic and cognitive/attentional-control processes are key variables in literacy development in young learners. Interactions between these variables are complex, and this complexity is increased in multilingual learners. With data on the interplay between metalinguistic and cognitive awareness, literacy, and multilingualism being scarce, it is far from clear how these variables interact and how they impact the individual child. This article sets out to shine some light on the interconnectedness and interactions between metalinguistic awareness, cognitive/executive functions, and (multilingual) literacy. Conclusions: We argue that the three dimensions are strongly correlated and that this correlation comes with important implications for language learning, language processing, and language development. However, the exact nature of these correlations is yet to be established.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease with progressive neurodegeneration, affecting both the cortical and the spinal component of the motor neuron circuitry in patients. The cellular and molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability is beginning to emerge. Yet, there are no effective cures for ALS, which affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year. Recent studies highlight the importance of the glymphatic system and its proper function for the clearance of the cerebral spinal fluid, which is achieved mostly during the sleep period. Therefore, a potential link between problems with sleep and neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. This paper discusses the present understanding of this potential correlation.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal infection is a major risk factor for diffuse white matter injury (dWMI), which remains the most common form of neurological disability among very preterm infants. The disease primarily targets oligodendrocytes (OL) lineage cells in the white matter but also involves injury and/or dysmaturation of neurons of the gray matter. This study aimed to investigate whether neuroinflammation preferentially affects the cellular compositions of the white matter or gray matter. Method: Neuroinflammation was initiated by intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at postnatal (P) day 5, and neurobiological and behavioral outcomes were assessed between P6 and P21. Results: LPS challenge rapidly activates microglia and astrocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of OL and neuron differentiation leading to myelination deficits. Specifically, neuroinflammation reduces the immature OLs but not progenitors and causes acute axonal injury (&amp;amp;beta;-amyloid precursor protein immunopositivity) and impaired dendritic maturation (reduced MAP2+ neural fiber density) in the cortical area at P7. Neuroinflammation also reduces the expression of doublecortin in the hippocampus, suggesting compromise in neurogenesis. Utilizing a battery of behavioral assessments, we found that LPS-exposed animals exhibited deficits in sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains. Conclusion: Our overall results indicate that neuroinflammation alone in the early postnatal period can produce cardinal neuropathological features of dWMI.</p>

	<p>Background: Hemodynamics during the growth process of cerebral aneurysms are incompletely understood. We developed a novel fluid&amp;amp;ndash;structure interaction analysis method for the identification of relevant scenarios of aneurysm onset. Method: This method integrates both fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, as well as their mutual interaction, for a comprehensive analysis. Patients with a single unruptured cerebral aneurysm were included. Results: Overall, three scenarios were identified. In scenario A, wall shear stress (WSS) was low, and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) was high in large areas within the region of aneurysm onset (RAO). In scenario B, the quantities indicated a reversed behavior, where WSS was high and OSI was low. In the last scenario C, a behavior in-between was found, with scenarios A and B coexisting simultaneously in the RAO. Structural mechanics demonstrated a similar but independent trend. Further, we analyzed the change in hemodynamics between the onset and a fully developed aneurysm. While scenarios A and C remained unchanged during aneurysm growth, 47% of aneurysms in scenario B changed into scenario A and 20% into scenario C. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings suggest that WSS and the OSI are reciprocally regulated, and both low and high WSS/OSI conditions can lead to aneurysm onset.</p>

	<p>Background: Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), most commonly an overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between brain white matter (WM) changes in MS and OAB symptoms is poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to evaluate (i) microstructural WM differences across MS patients (pwMS) with OAB symptoms, patients without LUT symptoms, and healthy subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (ii) associations between clinical OAB symptom scores and DTI indices. Methods: Twenty-nine female pwMS [mean age (SD) 43.3 years (9.4)], including seventeen with OAB [mean age (SD) 46.1 years (8.6)] and nine without LUT symptoms [mean age (SD) 37.5 years (8.9)], and fourteen healthy controls (HCs) [mean age (SD) 48.5 years (20)] were scanned in a 3T MRI with a DTI protocol. Additionally, clinical scans were performed for WM lesion segmentation. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. The Urinary Symptom Profile questionnaire assessed OAB severity. Results: A statistically significant reduction in FA (p = 0.004) was identified in microstructural WM in pwMS, compared with HCs. An inverse correlation was found between FA in frontal and parietal WM lobes and OAB scores (p = 0.021) in pwMS. Areas of lower FA, although this did not reach statistical significance, were found in both frontal lobes and the rest of the non-dominant hemisphere in pwMS with OAB compared with pwMS without LUT symptoms (p = 0.072). Conclusions: This study identified that lesions affecting different WM tracts in MS can result in OAB symptoms and demonstrated the role of the WM in the neural control of LUT functions. By using DTI, the association between OAB symptom severity and WM changes were identified, adding knowledge to the current LUT working model. As MS is predominantly a WM disease, these findings suggest that regional WM involvement, including of the anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus and a non-dominant prevalence in WM, can result in OAB symptoms. OAB symptoms in MS correlate with anisotropy changes in different white matter tracts as demonstrated by DTI. Structural impairment in WM tracts plays an important role in LUT symptoms in MS.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the global population, the burden of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is expected to increase, making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, an urgent priority. Results: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Conclusions: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future research directions.</p>

	<p>Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation&amp;amp;mdash;a factor previously linked to SI/SB development&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v2?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1097/v1?src=rss">A high-throughput gene expression analysis software tool for developmental time series and gene signature analysis of human cardiomyocyte differentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Publicly available high-throughput gene expression data enable the investigation of biological processes by the scientific community. Although several bioinformatics tools offer methodologies for basic differential gene expression analysis, difficulties arise in the analysis of multiple sample groups comprising a developmental time series, especially when the identification and classification of unique gene expression patterns is the primary goal of the study. Data analysis using these tools requires programming experience, which limits the accessibility of these tools to the broader community. To streamline developmental time-series investigations, we created the Developmental Gene Expression Analysis (devGEA) tool. This environment can be implemented locally or via web browsers to expedite differential gene expression analysis. This tool provides gene signature determination methods that can classify differentially expressed genes based on their correlation with gene expression patterns. devGEA was used to characterize cardiac development gene expression signatures from high-throughput RNA-seq datasets profiling small-molecule directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs). After pre-processing, discrete gene expression criteria-based expected changes were used to classify the genes into developmental signatures. Several cardiomyocyte differentiation markers and candidate cardiac genes representing different developmental signatures were experimentally validated using the GIBCOTM hiPSC line. This method was then compared to a gene signature correlation approach that classified expressed genes based on their degree of similarity with key cardiac developmental signatures representing the stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, devGEA provides a robust workflow for investigator-driven analysis of developmental time series, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes and gene signatures for extensive experimental investigation. We also introduced a method for classifying genes by their correlation with genes or developmental patterns of interest. Our correlation-based method takes advantage of a priori knowledge of an experiment and is conceptually simpler than unsupervised clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-789/v2?src=rss">Occurrence of pathogenic yeast species in artisanal cheeses from Boyacá, Colombia, including fluconazole resistant isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1096/v1?src=rss">Fiscal sustainability analysis in selected SADC region countries with emphasis on South Africa: dynamic modeling, nonlinear causality, and machine learning approaches [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to evaluate the changes in the sustainability of fiscal policies in South Africa and selected Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by employing the Kalman filter and Markov switching model and further overcome the limitations of previous studies by considering the impact of previously neglected variables. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes regression analysis, the Kalman filter, and the Markov switching model. By analysing GDP data for SADC countries, regime shifts are estimated, and fiscal sustainability is evaluated. To enhance numerical adaptation, a random walk state space model is incorporated into the conventional Kalman filter. Originality and value This study significantly contributes to academia and the field of economics in South Africa by addressing previous research limitations on fiscal policy sustainability. It incorporates previously omitted variables and employs advanced estimation techniques, such as the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model, to provide a comprehensive understanding of fiscal sustainability in South Africa and selected SADC countries. The findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers and government authorities, including the necessity of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt, adherence to specified borrowing ratios, and reforms to increase savings and overall fiscal sustainability in the SADC region. Findings The random walk-based Kalman filter exhibits superior numerical adaptation compared to the conventional approach. An analysis of normalized financial impacts reveals significant variations in fiscal sustainability among SADC countries and different GDP categories. Countries with higher GDPs generally exhibit greater financial sustainability, while those with lower GDPs face more challenges in this regard. Conclusion Advanced estimation techniques like the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model offer critical insights into fiscal sustainability in South Africa and the broader SADC region. They further provide a more accurate and comprehensive analysis, revealing significant variations in fiscal stability across different GDP categories.

                <p>by Ylva Katarina Wedmark, Jon Olav Vik, Ove Øyås</p>

The metabolic network of an organism can be analyzed as a constraint-based model. This analysis can be biased, optimizing an objective such as growth rate, or unbiased, aiming to describe the full feasible space of metabolic fluxes through pathway analysis or random flux sampling. In particular, pathway analysis can decompose the flux space into fundamental and formally defined metabolic pathways. Unbiased methods scale poorly with network size due to combinatorial explosion, but a promising approach to improve scalability is to focus on metabolic subnetworks, e.g., cells’ metabolite exchanges with each other and the environment, rather than the full metabolic networks. Here, we applied pathway enumeration and flux sampling to metabolite exchanges in microbial species and a microbial community, using models ranging from central carbon metabolism to genome-scale and focusing on pathway definitions that allow direct targeting of subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges (elementary conversion modes, elementary flux patterns, and minimal pathways). Enumerating growth-supporting metabolite exchanges, we found that metabolite exchanges from different pathway definitions were related through a hierarchy, and we show that this hierarchical relationship between pathways holds for metabolic networks and subnetworks more generally. Metabolite exchange frequencies, defined as the fraction of pathways in which each metabolite was exchanged, were similar across pathway definitions, with a few specific exchanges explaining large differences in pathway counts. This indicates that biological interpretation of predicted metabolite exchanges is robust to the choice of pathway definition, and it suggests strategies for more scalable pathway analysis. Our results also signal wider biological implications, facilitating detailed and interpretable analysis of metabolite exchanges and other subnetworks in fields such as metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Elena Miu, Luke Rendell, Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Daniel Cownden, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Eriksson, Marcus W. Feldman, Timothy Lillicrap, Richard McElreath, Stuart Murray, James Ounsley, Kevin N. Lala</p>

Social learning is common in nature, yet cumulative culture (where knowledge and technology increase in complexity and diversity over time) appears restricted to humans. To understand why, we organized a computer tournament in which programmed entries specified when to learn new knowledge and when to refine (i.e. improve) existing knowledge. The tournament revealed a ‘refinement paradox’: refined behavior afforded higher payoffs as individuals converged on a small number of successful behavioral variants, but refining did not generally pay. Paradoxically, entries that refined only in certain conditions did best during behavioral improvement, while simple copying entries thrived when refinement levels were high. Cumulative cultural evolution may be rare in part because sophisticated strategies for improving knowledge and technology are initially advantageous, yet complex culture, once achieved, favors conformity, blind imitation and hyper-credulity.

                <p>by Carlos Albors, Jordi Mill, Andy L. Olivares, Xavier Iriart, Hubert Cochet, Oscar Camara</p>

Left atrial appendage occlusion devices (LAAO) are a feasible alternative for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at high risk of thromboembolic stroke and contraindication to antithrombotic therapies. However, optimal LAAO device configurations (i.e., size, type, location) remain unstandardized due to the large anatomical variability of the left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology, leading to a 4-6% incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT). In-silico simulations have the potential to assess DRT risk and identify the key factors, such as suboptimal device positioning. This work presents fluid simulation results computed on 20 patient-specific left atrial geometries, analysing different commercially available LAAO occluders, including plug-type and pacifier-type devices. In addition, we explored two distinct device positions: 1) the real post-LAAO intervention configuration derived from follow-up imaging; and 2) one covering the pulmonary ridge if it was not achieved during the implantation (13 out of 20). In total, 33 different configurations were analysed. In-silico indices indicating high risk of DRT (e.g., low blood flow velocities and flow complexity around the device) were combined with particle deposition analysis based on a discrete phase model. The obtained results revealed that covering the pulmonary ridge with the LAAO device may be one of the key factors to prevent DRT, resulting in higher velocities and reduced flow recirculations (e.g., mean velocities of 0.183 ± 0.12 m/s and 0.236 ± 0.16 m/s for uncovered versus covered positions in DRT patients). Moreover, disk-based devices exhibited enhanced adaptability to various LAA morphologies and, generally, demonstrated a lower risk of abnormal events after LAAO implantation.

Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (<i>P</i> < 9.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits. The study also demonstrates potential of PGSs for complex traits to capture early, presymptomatic lipid alterations, highlighting its utility in understanding disease mechanisms and early disease detection.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002807">SPOT: A machine learning model that predicts specific substrates for transport proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Nico Niebuhr, Gregory Butler, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Transport proteins play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and are central to many aspects of molecular biology and medicine. Determining the function of transport proteins experimentally is challenging, as they become unstable when isolated from cell membranes. Machine learning-based predictions could provide an efficient alternative. However, existing methods are limited to predicting a small number of specific substrates or broad transporter classes. These limitations stem partly from using small data sets for model training and a choice of input features that lack sufficient information about the prediction problem. Here, we present SPOT, the first general machine learning model that can successfully predict specific substrates for arbitrary transport proteins, achieving an accuracy above 92% on independent and diverse test data covering widely different transporters and a broad range of metabolites. SPOT uses Transformer Networks to represent transporters and substrates numerically. To overcome the problem of missing negative data for training, it augments a large data set of known transporter-substrate pairs with carefully sampled random molecules as non-substrates. SPOT not only predicts specific transporter-substrate pairs, but also outperforms previously published models designed to predict broad substrate classes for individual transport proteins. We provide a web server and Python function that allows users to explore the substrate scope of arbitrary transporters.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002795">An estimate of fitness reduction from mutation accumulation in a mammal allows assessment of the consequences of relaxed selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>

Each generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.

[version 2; peer review: 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Restorative dental materials are defined as substances that are used to repair, replace, or enhance a patient’s teeth. Various materials used in paediatric dentistry are zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer cement, resin composite, calcium hydroxide, silver amalgam, giomers etc. GIC is a biocompatible material having a low thermal expansion coefficient and fluoride release property. There are still a few drawbacks of GICdue of their poor mechanical properties therefore addition of Silver Nanoparticles demonstrated improved mechanical and bactericidal capabilities. There hasn’t been much study on the quality of the bond contact between silver nanoparticles and dentin, as well as the color’s durability. Aim: To evaluate and compare the mechanical properties and bond strength of Glass ionomer cement reinforced with three different concentrations of silver nanoparticle as against conventional glass ionomer cement in primary Teeth. Materials and Method: Silver nanoparticles will be prepared using three chemicals namely, silver nitrate, sodium citrate and tannic acid. Traditional GIC (GC Fuji II, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) will be purchased. Three different concentrations of silver nanoparticles will be prepared i.e., 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%. The GIC specimens will then be divided into 4 groups: GIC without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),0.2%,0.4% and 0.6% AgNPs. Mechanical properties will be checked such as compressive, tensile, and bond strength using Universal Testing Machine. Expected Results: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles is expected to have better mechanical strength, less microleakage and wear resistance, greater fracture resistance and adhesive bond strength. Conclusion: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles will be expected to have better mechanical and physical properties than conventional Type II GICs and is expected to be a promising material for restoration in primary teeth.

                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background The primary objective worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been controlling disease transmission. However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. We explored the impact of lockdown measures on six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organization’s global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions The lockdown associated with COVID-19 has largely had a negative impact on the lifestyles of individuals and communities across many countries and cultures. However, some individuals and communities also initiated positive lifestyle-related behavioral changes. If the knowledge generated by studying the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on the six lifestyle factors is further consolidated, it could improve chronic disease outcomes. This will help better understand lifestyle behaviors amidst crises and assist in redesigning extreme public health measures such as lockdowns.. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.
