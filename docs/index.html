	<p>Objectives: Investigate the biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following acquired brain injury (ABI) and further explore the relationship between the biomechanical characteristics and aspiration. Methods: This is a single-center cross-sectional study. The tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The biomechanical characteristics, including velopharynx (VP) maximal pressure, tongue base (TB) maximal pressure, upper esophageal sphincter (UES) residual pressure, UES relaxation duration, and subglottic pressure, were examined by high-resolution manometry and computational fluid dynamics simulation analysis. The penetration&amp;amp;ndash;aspiration scale (PAS) score was evaluated by a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Results: Fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI were included. The decreased VP maximal pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration were found in the patient group compared with the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the subglottic pressure significantly decreased in patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was found in TB maximal pressure between groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). In addition, in the patient group, VP maximal pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.439; p = 0.015), UES relaxation duration (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.532; p = 0.002), and the subglottic pressure (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.775; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were negatively correlated with the PAS score, while UES residual pressure (rs = 0.807; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) was positively correlated with the PAS score (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), the correlation between TB maximal pressure and PAS score (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.315; p = 0.090) did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: The biomechanical characteristics in tracheostomized patients with aspiration following ABI might manifest as decreased VP maximal pressure and subglottic pressure, increased UES residual pressure, and shortened UES relaxation duration, in which VP maximal pressure, UES relaxation duration, subglottic pressure, and UES residual pressure were correlated with aspiration.</p>

                Hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons comprise the central pattern generator driving pulsatile reproductive hormone secretion in mammals. Han et al. show that the great majority of kisspeptin neurons exhibit brief periods of synchronized activity that are driven by glutamate transmission and modulated by the neuropeptides dynorphin and neurokinin B.

                The broad-spectrum antiviral, nucleoside analog T1106, is incorporated into nascent RNA by viral polymerases. Kouba et al. report cryo-EM structures of influenza polymerase, showing that consecutive, but not single, T1106 incorporation causes polymerase stalling, backtracking, and chain termination. These results detail one of the diverse mechanisms by which nucleoside analog drugs inhibit viral RNA synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Grasping with a twist: Dissociating action goals from motor actions in human frontoparietal circuits</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, prehension is typically not the end goal of hand-object interactions but a precursor for manipulation. Nevertheless, functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating manual manipulation have primarily relied on prehension as the end goal of an action. Here, we used slow event-related fMRI to investigate differences in neural activation patterns between prehension in isolation and prehension for object manipulation. Eighteen participants were instructed either to simply grasp the handle of a rotatable dial (isolated prehension) or to grasp and turn it (prehension for object manipulation). We used representational similarity analysis to investigate whether the experimental conditions could be discriminated from each other based on differences in task-related brain activation patterns. We also used temporal multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the evolution of regional activation patterns over time. Importantly, we were able to differentiate isolated prehension and prehension for manipulation from activation patterns in the early visual cortex, the caudal intraparietal sulcus, and the superior parietal lobule. Our findings indicate that object manipulation extends beyond the putative cortical grasping network (anterior intraparietal sulcus, premotor and motor cortices) to include the superior parietal lobule and early visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory and Reward Connectivity in Young and Older Adults During Music Listening and Rest</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic organization of functional brain networks are known to change with age, and are affected by perceptual input and task conditions. Here, we compare functional activity and connectivity of auditory and reward systems during music listening and rest between young (N=24) and older (N=24) adults, using whole brain regression, seed-based connectivity, and ROI-ROI connectivity analyses. We found that although auditory and reward regions follow expected patterns of activation in response to music listening across both groups, younger adults show higher within-network connectivity of auditory and reward regions as compared to older adults during both rest and music listening. We also show that this age-related difference was reduced during music listening, especially in individuals showing high self-reported musical reward. Furthermore, young adults showed higher connectivity between auditory network and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that was specific to music listening and varied as a function of self-reported musical liking. Meanwhile, older adults showed a more globally diffuse pattern of connectivity, including higher connectivity to bilateral lingual and inferior frontal gyri. Finally, connectivity between auditory and reward regions was higher during well-liked musical stimuli across all participants, and especially higher when listening to music selected by the participant. These results highlight the roles of aging and reward sensitivity on auditory and reward networks. Results may inform the design of music-based interventions in aging populations, and improve our understanding of functional network dynamics as a whole.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Synchronization as a Function of Engagement with the Narrative</a></h4>

              
                We can all agree that a good story engages us, however, agreeing which story is good is far more debatable. In this study, we explored whether engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' brain responses, by examining individual differences in engagement to the same story. To do so, we pre-registered and re-analyzed a previously collected dataset by Chang et al. (2021) of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of 25 participants who listened to a one-hour story and answered questionnaires. We assessed the degree of their overall engagement with the story and their engagement with the main characters. The questionnaires revealed individual differences in engagement with the story, as well as different valence towards specific characters. Neuroimaging data showed that the auditory cortex, the default mode network (DMN) and language regions were involved in processing the story. Increased engagement with the story was correlated with increased neural synchronization within regions in the DMN (especially the medial prefrontal cortex), as well as regions outside the DMN such as the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the reward system. Interestingly, positively and negatively engaging characters elicited different patterns of neural synchronization. Finally, engagement increased functional connectivity within and between the DMN, the dorsal attention network and the control network. Taken together, these findings suggest that engagement with a narrative synchronizes listeners' responses in regions involved in mentalizing, reward, working memory and attention. By examining individual differences in engagement, we revealed that these synchronization patterns are due to engagement, and not due to differences in the narrative's content.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Cortical Hierarchies with Temporal Hebbian Updates.</a></h4>

              
                A key driver of mammalian intelligence is the ability to represent incoming sensory information across multiple abstraction levels. For example, in the visual ventral stream, incoming signals are first represented as low-level edge filters and then transformed into high-level object representations. These same hierarchical structures routinely emerge in artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained for image/object recognition tasks, suggesting that a similar process might underlie biological neural networks. However, the classical ANN training algorithm, backpropagation, is considered biologically implausible, and thus several alternative biologically plausible methods have been developed. For instance, several cortical-inspired ANNs in which the apical dendrite of a pyramidal neuron encodes top-down prediction signals have been proposed. In this case, akin to theories of predictive coding, a prediction error can be calculated locally inside each neuron for updating its incoming weights. Notwithstanding, from a neuroscience perspective, it is unclear whether neurons could compare their apical vs. somatic spiking activities to compute prediction errors. Here, we propose a solution to this problem by adapting the framework of the apical-somatic prediction error to the temporal domain. In particular, we show that if the apical feedback signal changes the postsynaptic firing rate, we can use differential Hebbian updates, a rate-based version of the classical spiking time-dependent plasticity (STDP) updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a cortical-like deep ANN has been trained using such time-based learning rules. Overall, our work removes a key requirement of biologically plausible models for deep learning that does not align with plasticity rules observed in biology and proposes a learning mechanism that would explain how the timing of neuronal activity can allow supervised hierarchical learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Both GEF domains of the autism and epilepsy-associated Trio protein are required for proper tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Recessive mutations in the TRIO gene are associated with intellectual deficiency (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). TRIO is a dual guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA. Trio has been extensively studied in excitatory neurons, and has recently been found to regulate the switch from tangential to radial migration in GABAergic interneurons (INs), through GEFD1-Rac1-dependent SDF1/CXCR4 signalling. Given the central role of Rho-GTPases during neuronal migration and the implication of IN pathologies in ASD and DEE, we investigated the relative roles of both Trio's GEF domains in regulating the dynamics of INs tangential migration. In Trio-/- mice, we observed reduced numbers of tangentially migrating INs, with intact progenitor proliferation. Further, we noted increased growth cone collapse in developing INs, suggesting altered cytoskeleton dynamics. To bypass the embryonic mortality of Trio-/- mice, we generated Dlx5/6Cre;Trioc/c conditional mutant mice, which develop spontaneous seizures and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD and ID. These phenotypes are associated with reduced cortical IN density and functional cortical inhibition. Mechanistically, this reduction of cortical IN numbers reflects a premature switch to radial migration, with an aberrant early entry in the cortical plate, as well as major deficits in cytoskeletal dynamics, including enhanced leading neurite branching and slower nucleokinesis reflecting reduced actin filament condensation and turnover. Further, we show that both Trio GEFD1 and GEFD2 domains are required for proper IN migration, with a dominant role of the RhoA-activating GEFD2 domain. Altogether, our data show a critical role of the DEE/ASD-associated Trio gene in the establishment of cortical inhibition and the requirement of both GEF domains in regulating IN migration dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incorporating models of subcortical processing improves the ability to predict EEG responses to natural speech</a></h4>

              
                The goal of describing how the human brain responds to complex acoustic stimuli has driven auditory neuroscience research for decades. Often, a systems-based approach has been taken, in which neurophysiological responses are modeled based on features of the presented stimulus. This includes a wealth of work modeling electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to complex acoustic stimuli such as speech. Examples of the acoustic features used in such modeling include the amplitude envelope and spectrogram of speech. These models implicitly assume a direct mapping from stimulus representation to cortical activity. However, in reality, the representation of sound is transformed as it passes through early stages of the auditory pathway, such that inputs to the cortex are fundamentally different from the raw audio signal that was presented. Thus, it could be valuable to account for the transformations taking place in lower-order auditory areas, such as the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus (IC) when predicting cortical responses to complex sounds. Specifically, because IC responses are more similar to cortical inputs than acoustic features derived directly from the audio signal, we hypothesized that linear mappings (temporal response functions; TRFs) fit to the outputs of an IC model would better predict EEG responses to speech stimuli. To this end, we modeled responses to the acoustic stimuli as they passed through the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and inferior colliculus before fitting a TRF to the output of the modeled IC responses. Results showed that using model-IC responses in traditional systems analyses resulted in better predictions of EEG activity than using the envelope or spectrogram of a speech stimulus. Further, it was revealed that model-IC derived TRFs predict different aspects of the EEG than acoustic-feature TRFs, and combining both types of TRF models provides a more accurate prediction of the EEG response.

                The immediate molecular consequences of traumatic brain injuries or TBI are poorly understood. Here, we simulated TBI using an innovative laboratory apparatus that employs a 5.1 kg dummy head holding neuronal cells and generating a less than or equal to 4,000 g-force acceleration upon impact. Dynamic impact led to both reduction in neuron viability and massive solubility changes in the proteome profiled using Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay. The affected proteins mapped not only to the expected pathways like cell adhesion, collagen and laminin structures, as well as response to stress, but also to other dense protein networks, such as immune response, complement and coagulation cascades. The cellular effects are found to be mainly due to the shockwave rather than the g-force acceleration. Soft materials could reduce the impact severity only until being fully compressed. This study shows way to develop a proteome-based meter for measuring irreversible shockwave-induced cell damage and provides a resource for identifying TBI protein biomarkers and potential drug targets for developing products aiming at primary prevention and intervention.

                Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading cause of non-genetic intellectual disabilities in the Western world and is responsible of a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Structural and functional deficits in brain connectivity have been reported in FASD patients; still, whether and how PAE affects the axonal development of neurons and disrupts the wiring between brain regions is not known. Here, we developed a mouse model of moderate alcohol exposure during prenatal brain wiring to study the impact of PAE on corpus callosum (CC) development, a major white matter tract reported to be affected in FASD patients. Our results show that PAE induces aberrant navigation of interhemispheric CC axons that persist even after the end of the exposure, causing their ectopic termination in the contralateral cortex. Furthermore, these defects in interhemispheric connectivity persist into adulthood and are associated with defective bilateral sensorimotor coordination in behavioral tasks requiring cortical control and interhemispheric communication. Finally, we identified neuronal miR-17-5p and its target Ephrin type A receptor 4 (EphA4) as mediators of the effect of alcohol on the contralateral targeting of CC axons. Taken together, our results suggest that alteration of miRNA-mediated regulation of axon guidance signaling by prenatal alcohol exposure affects interhemispheric cortical connectivity and associated behavior in FASD.

                The neonatal period represents a critical phase of human brain development. During this time, the brain shows a dramatic increase in size, but it remains largely unclear how the morphology of the human brain develops in early post-partum life. Here we show that human newborns undergo a rapid formation of brain shape, beyond the expected growth in brain size. Using fractal analysis of structural neuroimaging data, we show that brain shape (i) strongly reflects infant maturity beyond differences in brain size, (ii) significantly outperforms brain size in predicting infant age at scan (mean error ~4 days), (iii) detects persistent alterations in prematurely born infants that are not captured by brain size, (iv) is consistently more sensitive to genetic similarity among neonates, and (v) is superior in predicting which newborns are twin siblings, with up to 97% accuracy. These findings identify the formation of brain shape as a fundamental maturational process in human brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the neural underpinnings of motivation for walking exercise</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivation is critically important for rehabilitation, exercise, and motor performance, but its neural basis is poorly understood. Recent correlational research suggests that superior frontal gyrus medial area 9 (SFG9m) may be involved in motivation for walking activity. This study experimentally evaluated brain activity changes in periods of additional motivation during walking exercise, and tested how these brain activity changes relate to self-reported exercise motivation and walking speed. Methods: Non-disabled adults (N=26; 65% female; 25 {+/-} 5 years old) performed a vigorous exercise experiment involving 20 trials of maximal speed overground walking. Half of the trials were randomized to include "extra motivation" stimuli (lap timer, tracked best lap time and verbal encouragement). Wearable near-infrared spectroscopy measured oxygenated hemoglobin responses ({Delta}HbO2) from frontal lobe regions, including the SFG9m, primary motor, dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior prefrontal, supplementary motor and dorsal premotor cortices. Results: Compared with standard trials, participants walked faster during "extra-motivation" trials (2.67 vs. 2.43 m/s; p<0.0001) and had higher {Delta}HbO2 in all tested brain regions. This extra motivation effect on {Delta}HbO2 was greatest for SFG9m (+703 uM) compared with other regions (+45 to +354 uM; p[&le;]0.04). Greater SFG9m activity was correlated with more self-determined motivation for exercise and faster walking speed. Conclusions: Simple motivational stimuli during walking exercise seem to upregulate widespread brain regions, especially SFG9m. This could help explain the positive effects of motivational feedback on gait outcomes observed in prior rehabilitation research. Thus, these findings provide a potential biologic basis for the benefits of motivational stimuli, elicited with clinically-feasible methods during walking exercise. Future clinical studies could build on this information to develop prognostic biomarkers and test novel brain stimulation targets for enhancing exercise motivation (e.g. SFG9m).

                Memory problems are common among older adults with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Employing a machine learning framework, the current study investigates the use of multi-domain features to classify individuals with and without alcohol-induced memory problems. A group of 94 individuals (ages 50-81 years) with alcohol-induced memory problems (Memory group) were compared with a matched Control group who did not have memory problems. The Random Forests model identified specific features from each domain that contributed to the classification of Memory vs. Control group (AUC=88.29%). Specifically, individuals from the Memory group manifested a predominant pattern of hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions except some connections involving anterior cingulate cortex which were predominantly hypoconnected. Other significant contributing features were (i) polygenic risk scores for AUD, (ii) alcohol consumption and related health consequences during the past 5 years, such as health problems, past negative experiences, withdrawal symptoms, and the largest number of drinks in a day during the past 12 months, and (iii) elevated neuroticism and increased harm avoidance, and fewer positive "uplift" life events. At the neural systems level, hyperconnectivity across the default mode network regions, including the connections across the hippocampal hub regions, in individuals with memory problems may indicate dysregulation in neural information processing. Overall, the study outlines the importance of utilizing multidomain features, consisting of resting-state brain connectivity collected ~18 years ago, together with personality, life experiences, polygenic risk, and alcohol consumption and related consequences, to predict alcohol-related memory problems that arise in later life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Garments that measure EEG: Evaluation of an EEG sensor layer fully implemented with smart textiles</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents the first garment capable of measuring EEG activity with accuracy comparable to state-of-the art dry EEG systems. The main innovation is an EEG sensor layer (i.e., the electrodes, the signal transmission, and the cap support) fully implemented as a garment, using threads, fabrics and smart textiles, without relying on any metal or plastic materials. The garment is interfaced via a connector to a mobile EEG amplifier to complete the measurement system. The new EEG system (Garment-EEG) has been characterized with respect to a state-of-the-art Ag/AgCl dry-EEG system (Dry-EEG) over the forehead area of healthy participants in terms of: (1) skin-electrode impedance; (2) electrophysiological measurements (spontaneous and evoked EEG activity); (3) artifacts; and (4) user ergonomics and comfort. The results show that the Garment-EEG system provides comparable recordings to Dry-EEG, but it is more prone to getting affected by artifacts in adverse recording conditions due to poorer contact impedances. Ergonomics and comfort favor the textile-based sensor layer with respect to its metal-based counterpart. User acceptance is the main obstacle for EEG systems to democratize neurotechnology and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. EEG sensor layers encapsulated in wearables have the potential to enable neurotechnology that is naturally accepted by people in their daily lives. Furthermore, by supporting the EEG implementation in the textile industry it is manufactured with lower cost and much less pollution compared to the metal and plastic industries.

                Oligodendrocytes are the sole myelin producing cells in the central nervous system. Oligodendrocyte numbers are tightly controlled across diverse brain regions to match local axon type and number, but the underlying mechanisms and functional significance remain unclear. Here, we show that autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cellular process that promotes cell survival under canonical settings, elicits premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis during development and regulates critical aspects of nerve pulse propagation. Autophagy flux is increased in premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and its genetic blockage causes ectopic oligodendrocyte survival throughout the entire brain. Autophagy acts in the TFEB-Bax/Bak pathway and elevates PUMA mRNA levels to trigger premyelinating oligodendrocyte apoptosis cell-autonomously. Autophagy continuously functions in the myelinating oligodendrocytes to limit myelin sheath numbers and fine-tune nerve pulse propagation. Our results provide in vivo evidence showing that autophagy promotes apoptosis in mammalian cells under physiological conditions and reveal key intrinsic mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte number.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The (Limited?) Utility of Brain Age as a Biomarker for Capturing Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                For decades, neuroscientists have been on a quest to search for a biomarker that can help capture age-related cognitive decline. One well-known candidate is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI data. Here we aim to formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for capturing cognitive decline. Using 504 aging participants (36-100 years old) from the Human Connectome Project in Aging, we created 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities. We first tested how much Brain Age from these age-prediction models added to what we had already known from a chronological age in capturing cognitive decline. Based on the commonality analyses, we found a large degree of overlap between Brain Age and chronological age, so much so that, at best, Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining the variation in cognitive decline. Next, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did not necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing cognitive decline beyond chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining cognitive decline. Lastly, unlike Brain Age, Brain Cognition, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict cognitive abilities from brain MRI data, provided much higher unique effects. Brain Cognition added over 11% to explain the variation in cognitive decline beyond chronological age, leading to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, while demonstrating the limited utility of Brain Age, we provided a solution to improve our ability to use brain MRI data as a biomarker for cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population-level neural correlates of flexible avoidance learning in medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been proposed to link sensory inputs and behavioral outputs to mediate the execution of learned behaviors. However, how such a link is implemented has remained unclear. To measure prefrontal neural correlates of sensory stimuli and learned behaviors, we performed population calcium imaging during a novel tone-signaled active avoidance paradigm in mice. We developed a novel analysis approach based on dimensionality reduction and decoding that allowed us to identify and isolate population activity patterns related the tone stimulus, learned avoidance actions and general motion. While tone-related activity was not informative about behavior, avoidance-related activity was predictive of upcoming avoidance actions. Moreover, avoidance-related activity distinguished between two different learned avoidance actions, consistent with a model in which mPFC contributes to the selection between different goal-directed actions. Overall, our results suggest that mPFC circuit dynamics transform sensory inputs into specific behavioral outputs through distributed population-level computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Induced Alpha And Beta Electroencephalographic Rhythms Covary With Single-Trial Speech Intelligibility In Competition</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological studies suggest that intrinsic brain oscillations influence sensory processing, especially of rhythmic stimuli like speech. Prior work suggests that brain rhythms may mediate perceptual grouping and selective attention to speech amidst competing sound, as well as more linguistic aspects of speech processing like predictive coding. However, we know of no prior studies that have directly tested, at the single-trial level, whether brain oscillations relate to speech-in-noise outcomes. Here, we combined electroencephalography while simultaneously measuring intelligibility of spoken sentences amidst two different interfering sounds: multi-talker babble or speech-shaped noise. We find that induced parieto-occipital alpha (7-15 Hz; thought to modulate attentional focus) and frontal beta (13-30 Hz; associated with speech-motor predictive coding) oscillations covary with trial-wise percent-correct scores; importantly, alpha and beta power provide significant independent contributions to predicting single-trial behavioral outcomes. Moreover, we observed large individual differences in the across-trial distribution of alpha and beta power as well as in the alpha-to-beta power ratio. This raises the possibility that listeners employed different task strategies: some may have relied heavily on focusing attention, while others on predictive coding. These results can inform models of speech processing and guide noninvasive measures to index different neural processes that together support complex listening.

	<p>Objective: To explore the characteristics and dynamic evolution of cognitive impairment in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Methods: Twenty-five patients with acute NMOSD and 30 age-matched healthy individuals were consecutively recruited in this study. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Chinese Version of Rey Auditory Vocabulary Learning Test (CRAVLT), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Digital Span Test (DST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task 3/2s version (PASAT-3/2), Rey&amp;amp;ndash;Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) and Stroop Color and Word Test (CWT) were used to evaluate cognitive function. The correlations between cognitive function and serum aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) antibody titer were analyzed. Results: Sixty-four percent of patients with acute NMOSD had cognitive dysfunction. MoCA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CRAVLT-N7 (p = 0.004), CRAVLT-N8 (p = 0.011), ROCF-C (p = 0.005), ROCF-R (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), PASAT-3 (p = 0.013), PASAT-2 (p = 0.001) and CWT-A (p = 0.017) were significantly worse in patients with acute NMOSD than those in control group. During follow-up visits, significant differences of serum AQP-4 antibody titers were still noted in NMOSD patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while no significant differences were found by MoCA. Conclusion: A high number of patients with acute NMOSD suffer from cognitive dysfunction. Serum AQP-4 antibody titers can decrease during disease remission, while obvious cognitive decline in these patients still exists.</p>

	<p>The objective of this meta-analysis was to present transparent data on the morphology of the pituitary gland (PG) using the available data in the literature. The main online medical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched to gather all relevant studies regarding PG morphology. The mean overall volume of the PG was found to be 597.23 mm3 (SE = 28.81). The mean overall height of the PG was established to be 5.64 mm (SE = 0.11). The mean overall length of the PG was found to be 9.98 mm (SE = 0.26). In the present study, the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall morphology and morphometric features were analyzed. Our results showed that, on average, females from Asia have the highest volume of PG (706.69 mm3), and males from Europe have the lowest (456.42 mm3). These values are crucial to be aware of because they represent the normal average properties of the PG, which may be used as reference points when trying to diagnose potential pathologies of this gland. Furthermore, the present study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results prove how the PG&amp;amp;rsquo;s size decreases with age. The results of the present study may be helpful for physicians, especially surgeons, performing procedures on the PG.</p>

	<p>It is reasonable to assume that emotional processes are involved in creative tasks and the generation of creative ideas. In this pilot study, we investigate the emotional correlates in professional drummers during different degrees of creative music playing. Ten participants performed three tasks: repetitive rhythmic drum playing, pattern-based improvisation, and attention-intensive free improvisation, while their EEG activity was recorded. Arousal and valence levels were estimated from the EEG data at baseline and for the three tasks. Results show significantly increased levels of valence (i.e., increased prefrontal right alpha power compared to prefrontal left alpha power) during pattern-based and free improvisation relative to baseline, and significantly increased levels of valence during free improvisation relative to pattern-based improvisation. These results seem to indicate that positive emotion (characterized as increased valence) is associated with the creation of original ideas in drum playing and that the freer the creative process, the greater the positive effect. The implication of these results may be of particular relevance in the fields of music-based therapeutic interventions and music pedagogy.</p>

	<p>Objective: Anxiety symptoms are persistent in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the underlying neural substrates are still unclear. In the current study, we aimed to explore the underlying neural mechanisms in PD patients with anxiety symptoms. Methods: 42 PD-A patients, 41 PD patients without anxiety symptoms (PD-NA), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in the present study. All the subjects performed 3.0T fMRI scans. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analysis was used to investigate the alterations in neural activity among the three groups. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the altered fALFF value of the PD-A group and anxiety scores. Results: Compared with HCs, PD-A patients had higher fALFF values in the left cerebellum, cerebellum posterior lobe, bilateral temporal cortex, and brainstem and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, and left inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, between the two PD groups, PD-A patients showed higher fALFF values in the right precuneus and lower fALFF values in the bilateral inferior gyrus, bilateral basal ganglia areas, left inferior parietal lobule, and left occipital lobe. Furthermore, Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that the right precuneus and left caudate were correlated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Conclusion: Our study found that anxiety symptoms in PD patients may be related to alterations of neurological activities in multiple brain regions. Furthermore, these may be critical radiological biomarkers for PD-A patients. Therefore, these findings can improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-A.</p>

	<p>These are the preliminary results of a 12-week non-randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study comparing the effectiveness of trazodone in an extended-release formulation (XR) versus SSRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants (n = 76) were recruited, and 42 were assigned to the trazodone XR group and 34 to the SSRIs group. The choice of drug was based on clinical presentation and relied upon the attending physician. Assessments were made at five observation time points, at the following weeks: 0, and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The evaluations included: symptoms of depression (MADRS, QIDS-clinician, and self-rated versions-primary study endpoints), anhedonia (SHAPS), anxiety (HAM-A), insomnia (AIS), psychosocial functioning (SDS), and therapeutic efficacy (CGI). At baseline, the trazodone group had significantly more severe depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms and worse psychosocial functioning compared to the SSRIs group. After 12 weeks, trazodone XR was more effective than SSRIs in reducing the severity of insomnia and depression. There were no differences between the groups in the frequencies of therapeutic response and remission, which indicated the non-inferiority of the trazodone XR treatment. In conclusion, our results showed that in a &amp;amp;ldquo;real world&amp;amp;rdquo; setting, trazodone XR is effective in the treatment of patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: We investigated the differences in the neuropsychological profile as well as the pneumological and motor functions in two groups of patients admitted to rehabilitation who received different respiratory support during their COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: Group-1 (n = 18; 15 male, median age 67.5) consisted of patients who received non-invasive mechanical ventilation; Group-2 (n = 19; 16 male, median age 63) consisted of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (R-BANS) to evaluate the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cognition. Depression and anxiety were also measured at admission and discharge to rehabilitation. (3) Results: At admission, patients impaired at MMSE were 44% in Group-1 and 5% in Group-2, while patients impaired at FAB were 88% in Group-1 and 26% in Group-2. Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size revealed meaningful differences between groups for FAB, R-BANS global score, immediate and delayed memory, and attention-coding task, with Group-2 performing better than Group-1 across all measures. At discharge, 52% of the 25 patients re-assessed still had mild to moderate cognitive deficits, while 19% had depression and 35% had anxiety. (4) Conclusions: Patients who received oxygen therapy experienced higher levels of acute and chronic stress compared to those who benefitted from invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite patients showing a meaningful improvement at discharge, cognitive impairment persisted in a great number of patients; therefore, long-term neuropsychological follow-up and treatment for COVID-19 patients are recommended.</p>

	<p>GGC repeat expansions in the 5&amp;amp;rsquo; untranslated region (5&amp;amp;rsquo;UTR) of the Notch Homolog 2 N-terminal-like C gene (NOTCH2NLC) have been reported to be the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). However, whether they exist in other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. To determine whether there is a medium-length amplification of NOTCH2NLC in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we screened 476 ALS patients and 210 healthy controls for the presence of a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and fragment analysis. The repeat number in ALS patients was 16.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 (range 7&amp;amp;ndash;46), whereas the repeat number in control subjects was 16.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.79 (range 10&amp;amp;ndash;29). An intermediate-length GGC repeat expansion was observed in two ALS patients (numbers of repeats: 45, 46; normal repeat number &amp;amp;le; 40) but not in the control group. The results suggested that the intermediate NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was associated with Chinese ALS patients, and further functional studies for intermediate-length variation are required to identify the mechanism.</p>

	<p>The aim of the present study was to examine the neurobiological correlates of the two negative symptom domains of schizophrenia, the Motivational Deficit domain (including avolition, anhedonia, and asociality) and the Expressive Deficit domain (including blunted affect and alogia), focusing on brain areas that are most commonly found to be associated with negative symptoms in previous literature. Resting-state (rs) fMRI data were analyzed in 62 subjects affected by schizophrenia (SZs) and 46 healthy controls (HCs). The SZs, compared to the HCs, showed higher rs brain activity in the right inferior parietal lobule and the right temporoparietal junction, and lower rs brain activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the bilateral anterior dorsal cingulate cortex, and the ventral and dorsal caudate. Furthermore, in the SZs, the rs brain activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.436, p = 0.006), in particular with the Motivational Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.424, p = 0.002), even after controlling for confounding factors. The left ventral caudate correlated with negative symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.407, p = 0.003), especially with the Expressive Deficit domain (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.401, p = 0.003); however, these results seemed to be affected by confounding factors. In line with the literature, our results demonstrated that the two negative symptom domains might be underpinned by different neurobiological mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Prolactinomas have been reported to impair cognition in broad aspects. However, few studies investigated the influence of prolactinomas on cognitive flexibility never mentioning the underlying neural and electrophysiological mechanism. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in a colour-shape switching task. Patients with prolactinomas showed longer reaction time in switch trials and larger switch costs relative to healthy controls (HCs). Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontal theta activity in switch trials, the generally weak frontal theta activity in patients implied that they could not afford the executive control to configure task sets. Meanwhile, machine-learning based classification revealed that patients manifested non-selective brain patterns in response to different task types (colour vs. shape task) and different task states (switch vs. repeat state), which collectively suggested the cognitive dysfunction in preparation for a changing environment. Compared to HCs who showed stronger frontoparietal synchronization in switch trials, this enhanced frontoparietal connectivity was disrupted among patients with severe prolactinomas. This finding implicated greater hyperprolactinemia was linked to a larger decrease in cognitive performance. Taken together, the present study highlighted frontal theta power, and frontoparietal connectivity at theta band as the electrophysiological markers of the impaired cognitive flexibility and task control in patients with prolactinomas.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between beta oscillations and brain iron deposition. Beta oscillations were filtered from the microelectrode recordings of local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the ratio of the power spectral density of beta oscillations (PSDXb) to that of the LFP signals was calculated. Iron deposition in the deep gray matter (DGM) structures was indirectly assessed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), part III, was used to assess the severity of symptoms. Spearman correlation coefficients were applied to assess the associations of PSDXb with QSM values in the DGM structures and the severity of symptoms. PSDXb showed a significant positive correlation with the average QSM values in DGM structures, including caudate and substantia nigra (SN) (p = 0.008 and 0.044). Similarly, the PSDXb showed significant negative correlations with the severity of symptoms, including axial symptoms and the gait in the medicine-off state (p = 0.006 for both). The abnormal iron metabolism in the SN and striatum pathways may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence of abnormal beta oscillations in the STN, and beta oscillations may serve as important pathophysiological biomarkers of PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal synaptic density PET with 11C‐UCB‐J 6 months after ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in synaptic density after ischemic stroke in vivo with synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) PET.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited patients with an ischemic stroke to undergo <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J PET/MR within the first month and 6 months after stroke. We investigated longitudinal changes of partial volume corrected <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio; relative to centrum semiovale) within the ischemic lesion, peri-ischemic area and unaffected ipsilesional and contralesional grey matter. We also explored crossed cerebellar diaschisis at 6 months. Additionally, we defined brain regions potentially influencing upper limb motor recovery after stroke and studied <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR evolution in comparison to baseline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 13 patients (age = 67±15 years) we observed decreasing <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in the ischemic lesion (ΔSUVR = -1.0, p=0.001) and peri-ischemic area (ΔSUVR = -0.31, p=0.02) at 6 months after stroke compared to baseline. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis as measured with <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR was present in 11/13 (85%) patients at 6 months. <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR did not augment in ipsilesional or contralesional brain regions associated with motor recovery. On the contrary, there was an overall trend of declining <sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J SUVR in these brain regions, reaching statistical significance only in the non-lesioned part of the ipsilesional supplementary motor area (ΔSUVR = -0.83, p=0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>At 6 months after stroke, synaptic density further declined in the ischemic lesion and peri-ischemic area compared to baseline. Brain regions previously demonstrated to be associated with motor recovery after stroke did not show increases in synaptic density.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of ascending ventral‐tegmental fibers for recovery after stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The integrity of cortical motor networks and their descending effector-pathway (the corticospinal tract; CST) is a major determinant motor recovery after stroke. However, this view neglects the importance of ascending tracts and their modulatory effects on cortical physiology. Here, we explore the role of such a tract that connects dopaminergic ventral tegmental midbrain nuclei to motor cortex (the VTMC-tract) for post-stroke recovery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Lesion data and diffusivity parameters (fractional anisotropy) of the ipsi- and contralesional VTMC-tract and CST were obtained from 133 patients (63.9±13.4 years, 45 female) during acute and chronic stage after first-ever ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. Degeneration of VTMC-tract and CST was quantified and related to clinical outcome parameters (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] with motor and cortical-symptom subscores; modified Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score [mFMMS]; modified Ranking Scale [mRS]).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A significant post-stroke degeneration occurred in both tracts, but only VTMC-degeneration was associated with lesion size. Using multiple regression models, we dissected the impact of particular tracts on recovery: Changes in VTMC-tract integrity were stronger associated with independence in daily activities (mRS), upper limb motor impairment (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) captured by NIHSS compared to CST. Changes in CST-integrity merely were associated with the degree of hemiparesis (NIHSS motor subscale).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke outcome is influenced by ascending (VTMC) and descending (CST) fiber tracts. Favourable outcome regarding independence (mRS), upper limb motor function (mFMMS) and cortical symptoms (aphasia, neglect) was stronger related to the ascending than descending tract.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">APLF and long non-coding RNA NIHCOLE promote stable DNA synapsis in non-homologous end joining</a></h4>

              
                DNA repair via non-homologous end joining is regulated by poorly understood accessory factors. De Bragança et al. find that APLF promotes the stable joining of DNA ends by Ku70-Ku80, further reinforced by long non-coding RNA NIHCOLE. They propose that Ku70-Ku80 simultaneously binds DNA ends, APLF, and lncRNAs to strengthen DNA synapsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Traumatic brain injury induced microglial and Caspase3 activation in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the main causes of sudden death after head trauma. These injuries can result in severe degeneration and neuronal cell death in the CNS, including the retina which is a crucial part of the brain responsible for perceiving and transmitting visual information. The long-term effects of mild-repetitive TBI (rmTBI) are far less studied thus far, even though damages induced by repetitive injuries occurring in the brain are more common, especially amongst athletes. rmTBI can also have a detrimental effect on the retina and the pathophysiology of these injuries are likely to differ from the severe TBI (sTBI) retinal injury.

Here we showed how rmTBI and sTBI can dissimilarly affect the retina. Our results indicate an increase in the number of activated microglial cells and Caspase3-positive cells in the retina in both traumatic models, suggesting a rise in the level of inflammation and cell death after TBI. The pattern of microglial activation appears evenly distributed and widespread but differs amongst the various retinal layers. sTBI induced microgial activation in both the superficial and deep retinal layers. In contrast to sTBI, no significant change occurred following the repetitive mild injury in the superficial layer, only the deep layer (spanning from the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer) shows microglial activation. This difference suggests that alternate response mechanisms play a role in the case of the different TBI incidents. The Caspase3 activation pattern showed a uniform increase in both the superficial and deep layers of the retina. This suggests a different action in the course of the disease in sTBI and rmTBI models and points to the need for new diagnostic procedures. Our present results suggest that the retina might serve as such a model of head injuries since the retinal tissue reacts to both forms of TBI and is the most accessible part of the human brain.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia patients with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 (C9-HRE) accumulate poly-GR and poly-PR aggregates. The pathogenicity of these arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) is thought to be driven by their propensity to bind to low complexity domains of multivalent proteins. However, the ability of R-DPRs to bind native RNA and the significance of this interaction remains unclear. We used computational and experimental approaches to characterize the physicochemical properties of R-DPRs and their interaction with RNA. We find that poly-GR predominantly binds ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in cells and exhibits an interaction that is predicted to be energetically stronger than that for associated ribosomal proteins. Critically, modified rRNA "bait" oligonucleotides restore poly-GR-associated ribosomal deficits in cells and ameliorate poly-GR toxicity in patient neurons and Drosophila models. Our work strengthens the hypothesis that ribosomal function is impaired by R-DPRs, highlights a role for direct rRNA binding in mediating ribosomal disfunction, and presents a strategy for protecting against C9-HRE pathophysiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A newly-recognized population of residual neural crest cells in the adult leptomeninges is re-activated for vascular repair</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest (NC) is a transient structure in vertebrate embryogenesis comprising highly migratory multipotent stem cells that give rise to a diverse array of cell types in organs throughout the body, including initiating neurovascular patterning. It is assumed that neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) disappear after development. Unexpectedly, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we discovered residual quiescent NCSCs in the adult mouse meninges which are activated by injury and contribute to the brains homeostatic response. RNA velocity, pathway, and transcription factor analyses in a murine stroke model (combined with in vivo imaging) show that these adult NCSCs migrate towards the perivascular spaces of the infarct and undergo a perivascular stromal cell transition that is regulated by Ptp1b, Ghr, and Stat3. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that these "vestigial" NCSCs are required for restoring vascular endothelial barrier function via {beta}-catenin and Stat3 signaling. These findings suggest that, in the adult, an unexpected reservoir of cells -- once pivotal to embryogenesis and vascular morphogenesis -- are re-invoked for neurovascular repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional control of visual neural circuit development by GS homeobox 1</a></h4>

              
                As essential components of gene expression networks, transcription factors regulate neural circuit assembly. GS homeobox 1 (gsx1) is expressed in the developing visual system; however, no studies have examined its role in visual system formation. In zebrafish, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons terminate in ten arborization fields (AFs) in the optic tectum (TeO) and pretectum (Pr). Pretectal AFs (AF1-AF9) mediate distinct and essential visual behaviors, yet we understand less about their development compared to AF10 in the TeO. Using gsx1 zebrafish mutants, immunohistochemistry, and transgenic lines, we observed that gsx1 is required for vesicular glutamate transporter, slc17a6b, expression in the Pr, but not overall neuron number. gsx1 mutants have normal eye morphology, yet exhibit impaired vision and a significantly reduced volume of RGC axons innervating the Pr and TeO, including loss of AF7. Consistent with this, prey capture is reduced in gsx1 mutants. Timed laser ablation of slc17a6b-positive neurons reveals that they aide directly in AF7 formation. This work is the first to implicate gsx1 in establishing cell identity and functional neural circuits in the visual system.

SUMMARY STATEMENTThis is the first study in any vertebrate model to establish a requirement for the homeobox transcription factor encoding gene, gsx1, in visual neural circuit formation and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding</a></h4>

              
                We propose that the neocortex implements active predictive coding (APC), a form of predictive coding that incorporates hierarchical dynamics and actions. In this model, each neocortical area estimates both sensory states and actions, and the cortex as whole learns to predict the sensory consequences of actions at multiple hierarchical levels. "Higher" cortical areas maintain more abstract representations at larger spatiotemporal scales compared to "lower" areas. Feedback from higher areas modulate the dynamics of both state and action networks in lower areas. This allows the cortical network to model the complex dynamics and physics of the world in terms of simpler compositional elements (state transition functions). Simultaneously, current higher level goals invoke sequences of lower level sub-goals and actions, allowing the network to solve complex planning problems by composing simpler solutions. Planning ("system 2" thinking) in turns allows the network to learn, over time, perception-to-action mappings (policies; "system 1" thinking) at multiple abstraction levels. We provide examples from simulations illustrating how the same APC architecture can solve problems that, at first blush, seem very different from each other: (1) how do we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements? (2) why does perception seem stable despite eye movements? (3) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, and nested reference frames for equivariant vision? (4) how do we model the "physics" of a complex environment by decomposing it into simpler components? (5) how do we plan actions in a complex domain to achieve a goal by composing sequences of sub-goals and simpler actions? and (6) how do we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences? We propose a mapping of the APC network to the laminar architecture of the cortex and suggest possible roles for cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, cortico-hippocampal and cortico-subcortical pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expanded tRNA methyltransferase family member TRMT9B regulates synaptic growth and function</a></h4>

              
                Nervous system function relies on the formation and function of synaptic connections between neurons. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila for new conserved synaptic genes, we identified CG42261/Fid/ TRMT9B as a negative regulator of synaptogenesis. TRMT9B has been studied for its role as a tumor suppressor in multiple carcinomas and is one of two metazoan homologs of yeast tRNA methyltransferase 9 (Trm9), which methylates tRNA wobble uridines. Members of the expanded family of tRNA methyltransferases are increasingly being associated with neurological disorders and new biochemical functions. Interestingly, whereas Trm9 homolog ALKBH8/CG17807 is ubiquitously expressed, we find that TRMT9B is enriched in the nervous system, including at synapses. However, in the absence of animal models the role of TRMT9B in the nervous system has remained unknown. Here, we generated null alleles of TRMT9B and ALKBH8, and through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry find that ALKBH8 is responsible for canonical tRNA wobble uridine methylation under basal conditions. In the nervous system, we find that TRMT9B negatively regulates synaptogenesis through a methyltransferase-dependent mechanism in agreement with our modeling studies. Finally, we find that neurotransmitter release is impaired in TRMT9B mutants. Our findings reveal a role for TRMT9B in regulating synapse formation and function, and highlight the importance of the expanded family of tRNA methyltransferases in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurological Disorder after Severe Pneumonia is Associated with Translocation of Bacteria from Lung to Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurological disorders after severe acute pneumonia have been attacked much attention in recent years. However, the underline mechanisms remain not very clear. Here we show that these neurological syndromes after severe acute pneumonia are partly attributed to the translocation of bacteria from the lung to the brain during acute pneumonia. We detected an emerging and increased bacteria in the brain tissue of mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced experimental severe pneumonia. Interestingly, using 16S rDNA amplification sequencing, similarities were found between the brains flora species and those of the lungs, indicating the bacteria in the brain may come from the lung. We also observed the impairment of the lung-blood barrier and brain-blood barrier, simultaneously, allowing lung bacteria invade the brain during pneumonia. An elevated microglia and astrocytes activation markers signature though bacterial infection-related pathways are observed by single-cell RNA sequencing, indicating a bacteria-induced disruption of brain homeostasis. Rapamycin delivered by platelet-derived extracellular vesicles provides an effective strategy to rescue the brain microenvironment and neurological disorders. Collectively, we identify lung bacteria that play a role in altering brain homeostasis, which provides new insight into the mechanism of neurological syndromes after severe pneumonia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simple Models For Neuroscience Research Discoveries: How Often Are These Models Used In Africa</a></h4>

              
                Simple animal model systems such as Drosophila, Zebrafish, and C. Elegans have enabled numerous breakthroughs in understanding human health and disease. Their conserved biological processes, ever-expanding established procedures for handling, and amenability for molecular and genetic manipulation, in addition to the minimal ethical concerns, have made these models preferred choices in several life science disciplines globally. Owing to their cheap maintenance cost, adopting these model systems will help bridge the research gap between Africa and the Global North and contribute to advancing scientific knowledge in African universities through practical sessions. However, the extent to which these models are used across Africa is unknown. Here, we analysed the use of Drosophila, Zebrafish, and C. elegans model systems in scientific publications from African laboratories from the year 2000 to 2021. Of 1851 PubMed-indexed publications in which at least one simple animal model was mentioned, 168 used at least one of these models for the actual investigation. With an average of 21 articles per country, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia contributed 75% of these studies. The remaining 25% were contributed by seven other countries at 2-7 articles per country. From here, we extracted and analysed information on funding and international collaboration. This revealed that 24.4 % of the studies were exclusively funded locally, 28.57 % exclusively funded internationally, 15.5% received both local and international funding, and the rest (31.5%) were unfunded, revealing that there is satisfactory access to funds for simple animal model studies, especially from external funders. By analysing the pattern of collaborations, we show that most of these studies had international collaborations, while very few collaborated within Africa. Our work provides data on the current state of research using simple model systems in African laboratories and argues that incorporating these models will advance biomedical science research in Africa.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A stochastic world model on gravity for stability inference</a></h4>

              
                The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in humans minds. Previous studies have found that humans develop a world model on gravity in the mind to infer the stability of objects. However, its characteristics are less clear, especially how it benefits our rapid response with satisfactory accuracy. Here we measure participants sensitivity to the direction of gravity in a stability inference task by directly manipulating gravitys direction in a game engine. We find that the world model is not a faithful copy of Newtonian Laws on gravity, but encodes gravitys direction as a Gaussian distribution with the vertical direction as the maximum likelihood of gravitys direction. The stochastic nature of the world model fits nicely with participants subjective assessment on the stability of stacks and explains the illusion that taller objects are considered more prone to collapse. Further, a computational model with reinforcement learning reveals that the stochastic nature originated from agents interaction with the real world, and simulations from the game engine illustrate its ecological advantage of balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. In sum, our stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of the predictive nature of neural networks implemented with a priori knowledge about the physical world, which may shed light on developing AI with human-like intelligence that can flexibly operate in open-ended environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral pallidal GABAergic neuron calcium activity encodes cue-driven reward-seeking and persists in the absence of reward delivery</a></h4>

              
                Reward-seeking behavior is often initiated by environmental cues that signal reward availability. This is a necessary behavioral response; however, cue reactivity and reward-seeking behavior can become maladaptive. To better understand how cue elicited reward-seeking becomes maladaptive, it is important to understand the neural circuits involved in assigning appetitive value to rewarding cues and actions. Ventral pallidum (VP) neurons are known to contribute to cue elicited reward-seeking behavior and have heterogeneous responses in a discriminative stimulus (DS) task. The VP neuronal subtypes and output pathways that encode distinct aspects of the DS task remain unknown. Here, we used an intersectional viral approach with fiber photometry to record bulk calcium activity in VP GABAergic (VP GABA) neurons in male and female rats as they learned and performed the DS task. We found that VP GABA neurons are excited by reward-predictive cues but not neutral cues, and that this response develops over time. We also found that this cue-evoked response predicts reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, we found increased VP GABA calcium activity at the time of expected reward delivery, which occurred even on trials when reward was omitted. Together, these findings suggest that VP GABA neurons encode reward expectation and calcium activity in these neurons is predictive of the vigor of cue-elicited reward-seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A thalamo-parietal cortex circuit is critical for place-action coordination</a></h4>

              
                The anterior and lateral thalamus (ALT) contains head direction cells that signal the directional orientation of an animal within an environment. ALT has direct and indirect connections with the parietal cortex (PC), an area hypothesized to play a role in coordinating viewer-dependent and viewer-independent spatial reference frames. This coordination between reference frames would allow an individual to translate movements toward a desired location from memory. Thus ALT-PC functional connectivity would be critical for moving toward remembered locations. This hypothesis was tested with a place-action task that requires associating an appropriate action (left or right turn) with a spatial location. There are four arms, each offset by 90 degrees, positioned around a central starting point. A trial begins in the central starting point. After exiting a pseudorandomly selected arm, the rat had to displace the correct object covering one of two (left versus right) feeding stations to receive a reward. For a pair of arms facing opposite directions, the reward was located on the left, and for the other pair, the reward was located on the right. Thus, each reward location had a different combination of allocentric location and egocentric action. Removal of an object was scored as correct or incorrect. Trials in which the rat did not displace any objects were scored as  no response trials. After an object was removed, the rat returned to the center starting position and the maze was reset for the next trial. To investigate the role of the ALT-PC network, muscimol inactivation infusions targeted bilateral PC, bilateral ALT, or the ALT-PC network. Muscimol sessions were counterbalanced and compared to saline sessions within the same animal. All inactivations resulted in decreased accuracy. Only bilateral PC inactivations resulted in increased no response trials, increased errors, and longer latency responses on the remaining trials. Thus, the ALT-PC network is critical for linking an action with a spatial location for successful navigation.

	<p>Background: Some authors have hypothesized that cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy (DC) could positively influence functional recovery through several mechanisms. However, only a few studies with small sample sizes have investigated the effects of cranioplasty on functional recovery. Our study aims at evaluating the role of post-DC cranioplasty in influencing the functional recovery in a large cohort of patients with different etiologies of acquired brain injury (ABI). Methods: This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 253 patients with ABI, consisting of 108 adults who underwent post-DC cranioplasty and 145 adults who did not. All the subjects underwent a 6-month individual rehabilitation program. Demographic data, etiology, classification and anatomical site of brain injury, neurological and functional assessment at baseline and on discharge, and number of deaths during hospitalization were recorded. Results: In our cohort, 145 patients (57.3%) and 108 patients (42.7%) had, respectively, a hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Only in the patients with TBI cranioplasty emerged as an independent predictor of better functional outcome in terms of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) total score at discharge (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.217, p = 0.001) and of the FIM variation during rehabilitation (&amp;amp;Delta;FIM) (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.315, p = 0.001). Conversely, in the case of HS, no associations were found between post-DC cranioplasty and functional recovery. Conclusions: Post-DC cranioplasty was associated with better functional recovery six months after TBI but not in the patients with HS. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HS are different from those of TBI and possibly play a role in the different outcomes between the two groups, further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed differences.</p>

	<p>Background: The society is aging in China, and the cognitive level of elderly post-stroke patients gradually declines. Face-to-face cognitive functional training is no longer sufficient. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a promising rehabilitation training device. In this study, we developed an IVR-based puzzle game to explore its effectiveness, feasibility, and safety in elderly stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. Methods: A total of 30 patients with mild post-stroke cognitive impairment after stroke were randomly assigned to a control or IVR group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy. Patients in the control group received traditional cognitive training, and those in the IVR group received IVR-based puzzle game therapy. Before and after treatment, Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), trail-making test-A (TMT-A), digit symbol substitution test (DSST), digital span test (DST), verbal fluency test (VFT), and modified Barthel index (MBI) were evaluated in both groups. In addition, the IVR group was administered a self-report questionnaire to obtain feedback on user experience. Results: There was no significant difference in the baseline data between the two groups. After six weeks of treatment, the cognitive assessment scores were improved in both groups. Moreover, the IVR group showed more improvements than the control group in the DSST (Z = 2.203, p = 0.028 &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.16); MOCA (T = 1.186, p = 0.246 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.44), TMT-A (T = 1.791, p = 0.084 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.65), MBI (T = 0.783, p = 0.44 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, d = 0.28), FDST (Z = 0.78, p = 0.435 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.02), BDST (Z = 0.347, p = 0.728 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.004), and VFT(Z = 1.087, p = 0.277 &amp;amp;gt; 0.05, &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.039) did not significantly improve. The significant difference in DSST represents an improvement in executive function and visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial cognitive characteristics. The other assessment scores did not show such features. Therefore, we did not observe significant differences through this measure. According to the results of the self-report questionnaire, most of the patients were satisfied with the equipment stability and training content. Several individuals reported mild adverse reactions. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that IVR-based puzzle games are a promising approach to improve post-stroke cognitive function, especially executive cognitive function, and visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial attention in older adults.</p>

	<p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a subtype of motor speech disorder usually co-occurring with language impairment. A supramodal processing difficulty, involving executive functions (EFs), might contribute to the cognitive endophenotypes and behavioral manifestations. The present study aimed to profile the EFs in CAS, investigating the relationship between EFs, speech and language severity, and the connectivity of the frontal aslant tract (FAT), a white matter tract involved in both speech and EFs. A total of 30 preschool children with CAS underwent speech, language, and EF assessments and brain MRIs. Their FAT connectivity metrics were compared to those of 30 children without other neurodevelopmental disorders (NoNDs), who also underwent brain MRIs. Alterations in some basic EF components were found. Inhibition and working memory correlated with speech and language severity. Compared to NoND children, a weak, significant reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left presupplementary motor area (preSMA) FAT component was found. Only speech severity correlated and predicted FA values along with the FAT in both of its components, and visual-spatial working memory moderated the relationship between speech severity and FA in the left SMA. Our study supports the conceptualization of a composite and complex picture of CAS, not limited to the speech core deficit, but also involving high-order cognitive skills.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-grained, nonlinear registration of live cell movies reveals spatiotemporal organization of diffuse molecular processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xuexia Jiang, Tadamoto Isogai, Joseph Chi, Gaudenz Danuser</p>

We present an application of nonlinear image registration to align in microscopy time lapse sequences for every frame the cell outline and interior with the outline and interior of the same cell in a reference frame. The registration relies on a subcellular fiducial marker, a cell motion mask, and a topological regularization that enforces diffeomorphism on the registration without significant loss of granularity. This allows spatiotemporal analysis of extremely noisy and diffuse molecular processes across the entire cell. We validate the registration method for different fiducial markers by measuring the intensity differences between predicted and original time lapse sequences of Actin cytoskeleton images and by uncovering zones of spatially organized GEF- and GTPase signaling dynamics visualized by FRET-based activity biosensors in MDA-MB-231 cells. We then demonstrate applications of the registration method in conjunction with stochastic time-series analysis. We describe distinct zones of locally coherent dynamics of the cytoplasmic protein Profilin in U2OS cells. Further analysis of the Profilin dynamics revealed strong relationships with Actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell symmetry-breaking and polarization. This study thus provides a framework for extracting information to explore functional interactions between cell morphodynamics, protein distributions, and signaling in cells undergoing continuous shape changes. Matlab code implementing the proposed registration method is available at https://github.com/DanuserLab/Mask-Regularized-Diffeomorphic-Cell-Registration.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) is a critical structure that mediates sustained vigilant responses to contextual, diffuse, and unpredictable threats. Dysfunction of the BST could lead to excessive anxiety and hypervigilance, which are often observed in posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders. Vigilance of potential future threats from the external environment is a basic brain function and probably requires rapid and/or short neural circuits, which enable both quick detection of the potential threats and fast adaptive responses. However, the BST in literature does not appear to receive spatial information directly from earlier visual or spatial processing structures. In this study, a novel subdivision of the BST is uncovered in monkey, rat, and mouse brains based on the human equivalent and is found in mouse to receive direct inputs from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and pretectal nucleus as well as from the spatial processing structures such as subiculum, presubiculum, and medial entorhinal cortex. This new subdivision, termed spindle-shaped small cell subdivision (BSTsc), is located between the known BST and the anterior thalamus. In addition to the unique afferent connections and cell morphology, the BSTsc also displays unique molecular signature (e.g., positive for excitatory markers ) compared with other BST subdivisions, which are mostly composed of inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The BSTsc appears to have largely overlapping efferent projections with other BST subdivisions such as the projections to the amygdala, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, septum, and brainstem. Together, the present study suggests that the BSTsc is poised to serve as a shortcut bridge directly linking spatial information from the environment to vigilant adaptive internal responses.</p>

     alt="Circadian rhythmicity of amyloid-beta-related molecules is disrupted in the choroid plexus of a female Alzheimer's disease mouse model"/>
<p>Alzheimer's phenotype, sex and age affect the expression of Amyloid-β scavengers. Amyloid-β scavengers such as angiotensin-converting enzymes show circadian rhythmicity in the choroid plexus of female 6-month-old mice. This rhythmicity is impaired in Alzheimer's disease animal models or in choroid plexus epithelial cells treated with Amyloid-β. Amyloid-β uptake by the choroid plexus epithelial cells displays circadian rhythmicity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The choroid plexus (CP) is part of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and was recently described as an important component of the circadian clock system. It is the principal source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and responsible for the synthesis and secretion of various neuroprotective peptides including those involved in amyloid-β (Aβ) transport/degradation, contributing to Aβ homeostasis. Inadequate Aβ metabolic clearance and transport across the BCSFB have been associated with circadian dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. To investigate whether AD pathology influences Aβ scavengers circadian expression, we collected CP at different time points from an AD mouse model (APP/PS1) (female and male animals, aged 6- and 12-months-old) and analyzed their mRNA expression by Real-time RT-PCR. Only angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in 6-month-old female wild-type mice and transthyretin (Ttr) expression in 12-month-old female wild-type mice presented significant rhythmicity. The circadian rhythmicity of Ace and Ttr, prompt us to analyze the involvement of circadian rhythm in Aβ uptake. A human CP papilloma (HIBCPP) cell line was incubated with Aβ-488 and uptake was evaluated at different time points using flow cytometry. Aβ uptake displayed circadian rhythmicity. Our results suggest that AD might affect Aβ scavengers rhythmicity and that Aβ clearance is a rhythmic process possibly regulated by the rhythmic expression of Aβ scavengers.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex pattern of facial remapping in somatosensory cortex following congenital but not acquired hand loss</a></h4>

              
                Cortical remapping after hand loss in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be predominantly dictated by cortical proximity, with adjacent body parts remapping into the deprived area. Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first confirmed an upright face organisation in all three groups, with the upper-face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of both forehead and lips in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across multiple facial parts, where relative to controls, the location of the cortical neighbour - the forehead - is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently more activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LabNet hardware control software for the Raspberry Pi</a></h4>

              
                Single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi make it easy to control hardware setups for laboratory experiments. GPIOs and expansion boards (HATs) give access to a whole range of sensor and control hardware. However, controlling such hardware can be challenging, when many experimental setups run in parallel and the time component is critical. LabNet is a C++ optimized control layer software to give access to the Raspberry Pi connected hardware over a simple network protocol. LabNet was developed to be suitable for time-critical operations, and to be simple to expand. It leverages the actor model to simplify multithreading programming and to increase modularity. The message protocol is implemented in Protobuf and offers performance, small message size, and supports a large number of programming languages on the client side. It shows good performance compared to locally executed tools like Bpod, pyControl, or Autopilot and reaches sub-millisecond range in network communication latencies. LabNet can monitor and react simultaneously to up to 14 pairs of digital inputs, without increasing latencies. LabNet itself does not provide support for the design of experimental tasks. This is left to the client. LabNet can be used for general automation in experimental laboratories with its control PC located at some distance. LabNet is open source and under continuing development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heterogeneous levels of delta-like 4 within a multinucleated niche cell maintains muscle stem cell diversity</a></h4>

              
                The quiescent muscle stem cell (QSC) pool is heterogeneous and generally characterized by the presence and levels of intrinsic myogenic transcription factors. Whether extrinsic factors maintain the diversity of states across the QSC pool remains unknown. The muscle fiber is a multinucleated syncytium that serves as a niche to QSCs, raising the possibility that the muscle fiber regulates the diversity of states across the QSC pool. Here, we show that the muscle fiber maintains a continuum of quiescent states, through a gradient of Notch ligand, Dll4, produced by the fiber and captured by QSCs. The abundance of Dll4 captured by the QSC correlates with the protein levels of the stem cell (SC) identity marker, Pax7. Niche-specific loss of Dll4 decreases QSC diversity and shifts the continuum to cell states that are biased toward more proliferative and committed fates. We reveal that fiber-derived Mindbomb1 (Mib1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase activates Dll4 and controls the heterogeneous levels of Dll4. In response to injury, with a Dll4-replenished niche, the normal continuum and diversity of the SC pool is restored, demonstrating bidirectionality within the SC continuum. Our data show that a post-translational mechanism controls heterogeneity of Notch ligands in a multinucleated niche cell to maintain a continuum of metastable states within the SC pool during tissue homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coordinated cadherin functions sculpt respiratory motor circuit connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Breathing, and the motor circuits that control it, are essential for life. At the core of respiratory circuits are Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. Despite their critical function, the principles that dictate how respiratory circuits assemble are unknown. Here we show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation in mice during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography; surprisingly, however, cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of phrenic MNs by descending respiratory inputs. Our findings demonstrate that type I and type II cadherins function cooperatively throughout the respiratory circuit to generate a robust breathing output and reveal novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The ‘ForensOMICS’ approach for postmortem interval estimation from human bone by integrating metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics</a></h4>

              
                The combined use of multiple omics allows to study complex interrelated biological processes in their entirety. We applied a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics to human bones to investigate their combined potential to estimate time elapsed since death (i.e., the postmortem interval [PMI]). This ‘ForensOMICS’ approach has the potential to improve accuracy and precision of PMI estimation of skeletonized human remains, thereby helping forensic investigators to establish the timeline of events surrounding death. Anterior midshaft tibial bone was collected from four female body donors before their placement at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility owned by the Forensic Anthropological Center at Texas State (FACTS). Bone samples were again collected at selected PMIs (219-790-834-872days). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to obtain untargeted metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic profiles from the pre- and post-placement bone samples. The three omics blocks were investigated independently by univariate and multivariate analyses, followed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify the reduced number of markers describing postmortem changes and discriminating the individuals based on their PMI. The resulting model showed that pre-placement metabolome, lipidome and proteome profiles were clearly distinguishable from post-placement ones. Metabolites in the pre-placement samples suggested an extinction of the energetic metabolism and a switch towards another source of fuelling (e.g., structural proteins). We were able to identify certain biomolecules with an excellent potential for PMI estimation, predominantly the biomolecules from the metabolomics block. Our findings suggest that, by targeting a combination of compounds with different postmortem stability, in the future we could be able to estimate both short PMIs, by using metabolites and lipids, and longer PMIs, by using proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in binding to a cytoplasmic domain of SK channels</a></h4>

              
                KCa2.1–3 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup>-channels (SK) require calmodulin to gate in response to cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. A model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding. Although structures support a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from calmodulin-disrupted SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and a C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light-scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and C-lobe-binding affinity is strong independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our peptide-binding data and electrophysiology show that SK gating models need deeper scrutiny. We suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent associations of both lobes of calmodulin to SKp are crucial events during gating. Additional investigations are necessary to complete a mechanistic gating model consistent with binding, physiology, and structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Right inferior frontal gyrus damage is associated with impaired initiation of inhibitory control, but not its implementation</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control is one of the most important control functions in the human brain. Much of our understanding of its neural basis comes from seminal work showing that lesions to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) increase stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a latent variable that expresses the speed of inhibitory control. However, recent work has identified substantial limitations of the SSRT method. Notably, SSRT is confounded by trigger failures: stop-signal trials in which inhibitory control was never initiated. Such trials inflate SSRT, but are typically indicative of attentional, rather than inhibitory deficits. Here, we used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to identify stop-signal trigger failures in human rIFG lesion patients, non-rIFG lesion patients, and healthy comparisons. Furthermore, we measured scalp-EEG to detect β-bursts, a neurophysiological index of inhibitory control. rIFG lesion patients showed a more than fivefold increase in trigger failure trials and did not exhibit the typical increase of stop-related frontal β-bursts. However, on trials in which such β-bursts did occur, rIFG patients showed the typical subsequent upregulation of β over sensorimotor areas, indicating that their ability to implement inhibitory control, once triggered, remains intact. These findings suggest that the role of rIFG in inhibitory control has to be fundamentally reinterpreted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intracranial recordings reveal three distinct neural response patterns in the language network</a></h4>

              
                A left-lateralized network of frontal and temporal brain regions is specialized for language processing--spoken, written, or signed. Different regions of this  language network have all been shown to be sensitive to various forms of linguistic information, from combinatorial sentence structure to word meanings, to sub-lexical regularities. However, whether neural computations are the same across and within these different brain regions remains debated. Here, we examine responses during language processing recorded intracranially in patients with intractable epilepsy. Across two datasets (Dataset 1: n=6 participants, m=177 language-responsive electrodes; Dataset 2: n=16 participants, m=362 language-responsive electrodes), we clustered language-responsive electrodes and found three distinct response profiles, with differences in response magnitude between linguistic conditions (e.g., sentences vs. lists of words), different temporal dynamics over the course of the stimulus, and different degrees of stimulus locking. We argue that these profiles correspond to different temporal receptive windows that vary in size between sub-lexical units and multi-word sequences. These results demonstrate the functional heterogeneity of neural responses in the language network and highlight the diversity of neural computations that may be needed in order to extract meaning from linguistic input. Importantly, electrodes that exhibit these distinct profiles do not cluster spatially and are instead interleaved across frontal and temporal language areas, which likely made It difficult to uncover functional differences in past fMRI studies. This mosaic of neural responses across the language network suggests that all language regions have direct access to distinct response types--a property that may be crucial for the efficiency and robustness of language processing mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep increases firing rate modulation during interictal epileptic activities in mesial structures</a></h4>

              
                Epileptic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are strongly influenced by sleep and circadian rhythms. However, human data on the effect of sleep on neuronal behavior during interictal activity have been lacking. We analyzed EEG data from epileptic patients implanted with macro and micro electrodes targeting mesial temporal structures. Sleep staging was performed on concomitantly recorded polysomnography and video-EEG. Automated IED detection identified thousands of IEDs per patient. Both the rate and amplitude of IEDs were increased with deeper stages of NREM sleep. Single unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit activity (MUA) increased their firing during the IED spike, and strongly decreased during the subsequent slow wave. These time-locked firing rate modulations were shown to increase during deeper stages of NREM sleep. Finally, during resting behaviour, neuronal firing rate, bursting rate and firing regularity were all shown to progressively decrease with deeper stages of NREM sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">dcSBM: A federated constrained source-based morphometry approach for multivariate brain structure mapping</a></h4>

              
                The examination of multivariate brain morphometry patterns has gained attention in recent years, especially for their powerful exploratory capabilities in the study of differences between patients and controls. Among many existing methods and tools for analysis of brain anatomy based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data, data-driven source based morphometry (SBM) focuses on the exploratory detection of such patterns. Constrained source-based morphometry (constrained SBM) is a widely used semi-blind extension of SBM that enables extracting maximally independent reference-alike sources using the constrained independent component analysis (ICA) approach. In order to operate, constrained SBM needs the data to be locally accessible. However, there exist many reasons (e.g., the concerns of revealing identifiable rare disease information, or violating strict IRB policies) that may preclude access to data from different sites. In this scenario, constrained SBM fails to leverage the benefits of decentralized data. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach: decentralized constrained source-based morphometry (dcSBM). In dcSBM, the original data never leaves the local site. Each site operates constrained ICA on their private local data while using a common distributed computation platform. Then, an aggregator/master node aggregates the results estimated from each local site and applies statistical analysis to find out the significant sources. In our approach, we first use UK Biobank sMRI data to investigate the reliability of our dcSBM algorithm. Finally, we utilize two additional multi-site patient datasets to validate our model by comparing the resulting group difference estimates from both centralized and decentralized constrained SBM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial thalamus neurons have distinct synaptic and cellular physiology</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory information is propagated from the periphery to the cerebral cortex by two parallel pathways through the ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) thalamus. VPL and VPM neurons receive somatosensory signals from the body and head, respectively. VPL and VPM neurons also receive cell-type-specific GABAergic input from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (nRT). Although VPL and VPM neurons have distinct connectivity and physiological roles, differences in the functional properties of VPL and VPM neurons remain unclear as they are often studied as one ventrobasal (VB) thalamus neuron population. Here, we directly compared synaptic and intrinsic properties of VPL and VPM neurons in C57Bl/6J mice of both sexes aged P25-P32. Recordings of spontaneous synaptic transmission suggested that VPL neurons receive excitatory synaptic input with higher frequency and strength than VPM neurons, while VPL neurons exhibited weaker inhibitory synapse strength than VPM neurons. Furthermore, VPL neurons showed enhanced depolarization-induced spike firing and greater spike frequency adaptation than VPM neurons. VPL and VPM neurons fired similar numbers of spikes during hyperpolarization rebound bursts, but VPM neurons exhibited shorter burst latency compared to VPL neurons, which correlated with increased sag potential during hyperpolarization. This work indicates that VPL and VPM thalamocortical neurons are functionally distinct populations. The observed functional differences could have important implications for their specific physiological and pathophysiological roles within the somatosensory thalamocortical network.

                Highly specialized microtubules in neurons are crucial to the health and disease of the nervous system, and their properties are strictly regulated by different post-translational modifications, including alpha-Tubulin acetylation. An imbalance in the levels of acetylated alpha-Tubulin has been reported in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) whereas pharmacological or genetic modulation that leads to increased acetylated alpha-Tubulin successfully rescues axonal transport defects and inhibits alpha-Synuclein aggregation. However, the role of acetylation of alpha-Tubulin in the human nervous system is largely unknown as most studies are based on in vitro evidence. To capture the complexity of the pathological processes in vivo, we analysed post-mortem human brain of PD patients and control subjects. In the brain of PD patients at Braak stage 6, we found a redistribution of acetylated alpha-Tubulin, which accumulates in the neuronal cell bodies in subcortical structures but not in the cerebral cortex, and decreases in the axonal compartment, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. High-resolution and 3D reconstruction analysis linked acetylated alpha-Tubulin redistribution to alpha-Synuclein oligomerization, leading us to propose a model for Lewy body (LB) morphogenesis. Finally, for the first time in post-mortem human brain, we observed threadlike structures, resembling tunnelling nanotubes that contain alpha-Synuclein oligomers and are associated with acetylated alpha-Tubulin enriched neurons. In conclusion, we disclose a novel aspect of LB morphogenesis, indicating the role of acetylated alpha-Tubulin in PD, that may provide clues to design novel therapeutic interventions.

Here, we show that the claustrum is crucial for control of these two distinct psychiatric disorders in ACE mice. In the process of anxiety test, the CaMKII-positive neurons in median portion of claustrum (MClaustrum) were obviously triggered, and chemogenetic suppressing these neurons efficiently reduced ACE-induced anxiety in adulthood. While, the CaMKII-positive neurons in anterior portion of claustrum (AClaustrum) were obviously activated in response to cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and chemogenetic suppressing these neurons efficiently blocked cocaine CPP in ACE mice during adulthood. Our findings dissociating specific sub-portions of claustrum for drug-related anxiety and susceptibility of addiction, extending our understanding to diverse functions of claustrum subregions.

                The process of brain folding is thought to play an important role in the development and organisation of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The study of cerebellar folding is challenging due to the small size and abundance of its folia. In consequence, little is known about its anatomical diversity and evolution. We constituted an open collection of histological data from 56 mammalian species and manually segmented the cerebrum and the cerebellum. We developed methods to measure the geometry of cerebellar folia and to estimate the thickness of the molecular layer. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to study the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding and its relationship with the anatomy of the cerebrum. Our results show that the evolution of cerebellar and cerebral anatomy follows a stabilising selection process. Ancestral estimations indicate that size and folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum increase and decrease concertedly through evolution. Our analyses confirm the strong correlation between cerebral and cerebellar volumes across species, and show that large cerebella are disproportionately more folded than smaller ones. Compared with the extreme variations in cerebellar surface area, folial wavelength and molecular layer thickness varied only slightly, showing a much smaller increase in the larger cerebella. These findings provide new insight into the diversity and evolution of cerebellar folding and its potential influence on brain organisation across species.

                Dorsal pulvinar has been implicated in visuospatial attentional and perceptual confidence processing. Perturbations of the dorsal pulvinar also induce an overt spatial saccade bias during free choices. But it remains unclear whether the dorsal pulvinar inactivation during an oculomotor target selection based on a perceptual decision will lead to perceptual impairment or a more general orienting deficit. To address this question, we reversibly inactivated unilateral dorsal pulvinar by injecting GABA-A agonist THIP while two macaque monkeys performed a color discrimination saccade response task with varying perceptual difficulty. We used Signal Detection Theory to dissociate perceptual discrimination (dprime) and spatial selection bias (response criterion) effects. We expected a decrease in dprime if dorsal pulvinar affects perceptual discrimination and a shift in response criterion if dorsal pulvinar is mainly involved in spatial orienting. After inactivation, we observed response criterion shifts away from contralesional stimuli, especially when two competing peripheral stimuli in opposite hemifields were present, for both difficulty levels. The saccade latency for the contralesional selection increased under all conditions. Notably, the dprime and overall accuracy remained largely unaffected. Our results underline the critical contribution of the dorsal pulvinar to spatial orienting while being less important for perceptual discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Virtual motivation: The psychological and transfer of learning effects of immersive virtual reality practice</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has shown practice within an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment improves real-world (RW) performance. Increased user motivation is one possible advantage of practicing in VR. One recent study showed that an enriched gaming environment led to higher levels of engagement, resulting in a direct learning benefit. The purpose of this study was to compare the intrinsic motivation, engagement, and transfer of learning differences between VR practice and RW practice of the same motor skill. Participants (n = 61) were randomly assigned to a RW practice group (n = 30) or a VR practice group (n = 31) in which they performed a golf putting task. Analyses showed VR practice led to a significantly greater increase in average IMI score than RW practice. Analyses for performance showed there was a significant (p < .001) improvement in accuracy (i.e., radial error) from pre to posttest, but the two groups did not differ from one another. Overall, these results partially support our hypotheses and suggest that VR practice led to a greater increase in motivation compared to RW practice. Additionally, these results suggest that VR practice was similarly effective at improving accuracy compared to RW practice. Future research directions are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective transduction and photoinhibition of pre-Botzinger neurons that project to the facial nucleus in rats affect the nasofacial activity</a></h4>

              
                The preBotzinger Complex (preBotC), a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBotC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetised and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBotC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBotC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviours. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviours have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metastatic infiltration of nervous tissue and periosteal nerve sprouting in multiple myeloma induced bone pain</a></h4>

              
                Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasia of B plasma cells that often induces bone pain. However, the mechanisms underlying myeloma-induced bone pain (MIBP) are mostly unknown. Using a syngeneic MM mouse model, we show that periosteal nerve sprouting of calcitonin-gene related protein (CGRP+) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43+) fibres occurs concurrent to the onset of nociception and its blockade provides transient pain relief. MM patient samples also showed increased periosteal innervation. Mechanistically, we investigated MM induced gene expression changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervating the MM-bearing bone and found alterations in pathways associated with cell cycle, immune response and neuronal signalling. The MM transcriptional signature was consistent with metastatic MM infiltration to the DRG, a never-before described feature of the disease that we further demonstrated histologically. In the DRG, MM cells caused loss of vascularization and neuronal injury, which may contribute to late-stage MIBP. Interestingly, the transcriptional signature of a MM patient was consistent with MM cell infiltration to the DRG. Overall, our results suggest that MM induces a plethora of peripheral nervous system alterations that may contribute to the failure of current analgesics and suggest neuroprotective drugs as appropriate strategies to treat early onset MIBP.

Significance statementMultiple myeloma induces periosteal nerve sprouting and metastasizes to the dorsal root ganglia, damaging blood vessels and causing transcriptional alterations that may mediate myeloma-induced bone pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social context modulates multibrain broadband dynamics and functional brain-to-brain coupling in the group of mice</a></h4>

              
                Although mice are social animals, studies that explore the simultaneously recorded neural activities of multiple mice, especially in a social setting, are still lacking. In this study, we simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) signals in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) from up to four mice. The brain activities of the mice were measured in two contradicting conditions - freely interacting in a group or being individually separated. We found that social context and the locomotive states predominately modulate the entire LFP structure. Power spectral density (PSD) estimate and spectrogram of LFP signals showed a broadband modulation; lower frequency bands--delta (<4Hz), theta (4-7Hz), and alpha (8-12Hz) power were highly correlated to each other and anti-correlated with gamma and high gamma (>30Hz) power. We calculated the high-to-low-power ratio (HLR) and found that HLR was higher when the mice were in a group than were separated. The HLR was also higher when they were active--whether or not they were moving. The mice in the group showed higher HLR in any locomotive states. We then analyzed whether social context can be divided into sub-contexts. Notably, the aggregation of animals, called huddling, decreased social context-induced increase in HLR. Multibrain analyses of HLR indicated that the mice in the group displayed high cross-correlation to each other, indicating interbrain synchrony. Then we examined whether there is any directional relationship between HLR from pairs of mice. A majority of dyad selected within the group of mice showed unilateral precedence of HLR by Granger causality analysis, comprising a hierarchical social structure based on a directionality of influence. Overall, this study shows the importance of the social environment in brain dynamics and emphasizes the value of simultaneous multibrain recording for researching social behaviors and their neural correlates.

One-sentence summaryCoexistence modulates overall brain activities with unilateral causal relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A change in behavioral state switches the pattern of motor output that underlies rhythmic head and orofacial movements</a></h4>

              
                The breathing rhythm serves as a reference that paces orofacial motor actions and orchestrates active sensing. Past work reports that pacing occurs solely at a fixed phase relative to sniffing. We reevaluated this constraint as a function of exploratory behavior. Allocentric and egocentric rotations of the head and the electromyogenic activity of the underlying motoneurons for head and orofacial movements were recorded in free-ranging rats as they searched for food. We found that a change in state from foraging to rearing is accompanied by a change in the phase of muscular activation relative to sniffing, so that pacing now occurs at one of two phases. Further, head-turning is biased such that an animal gathers a novel sample of its environment upon inhalation. In toto, the coordination of active sensing has a previously unrealized computational complexity that, in principle, can emerge from hindbrain circuits with fixed architecture and credible synaptic time-delays.

	<p>The process of categorizing sounds into distinct phonetic categories is known as categorical perception (CP). Response times (RTs) provide a measure of perceptual difficulty during labeling decisions (i.e., categorization). The RT is quasi-stochastic in nature due to individuality and variations in perceptual tasks. To identify the source of RT variation in CP, we have built models to decode the brain regions and frequency bands driving fast, medium and slow response decision speeds. In particular, we implemented a parameter optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; behavioral RTs from their neural EEG data. We adopted visual interpretation of model response using Guided-GradCAM to identify spatial-spectral correlates of RT. Our framework includes (but is not limited to): (i) a data augmentation technique designed to reduce noise and control the overall variance of EEG dataset; (ii) bandpower topomaps to learn the spatial-spectral representation using CNN; (iii) large-scale Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to find best performing CNN model; (iv) ANOVA and posthoc analysis on Guided-GradCAM activation values to measure the effect of neural regions and frequency bands on behavioral responses. Using this framework, we observe that &amp;amp;alpha;&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;beta; (10&amp;amp;ndash;20 Hz) activity over left frontal, right prefrontal/frontal, and right cerebellar regions are correlated with RT variation. Our results indicate that attention, template matching, temporal prediction of acoustics, motor control, and decision uncertainty are the most probable factors in RT variation.</p>

	<p>Subthreshold neural oscillations have been observed in several brain regions and can influence the timing of neural spikes. However, the spatial extent and function of these spontaneous oscillations remain unclear. To study the mechanisms underlying these oscillations, we use optogenetic stimulation to generate oscillating waves in the longitudinal hippocampal slice expressing optopatch proteins. We found that optogenetic stimulation can generate two types of neural activity: suprathreshold neural spikes and subthreshold oscillating waves. Both waves could propagate bidirectionally at similar speeds and go through a transection of the tissue. The propagating speed is independent of the oscillating frequency but increases with increasing amplitudes of the waves. The endogenous electric fields generated by oscillating waves are about 0.6 mV/mm along the dendrites and about 0.3 mV/mm along the cell layer. We also observed that these oscillating waves could interfere with each other. Optical stimulation applied simultaneously at each slice end generated a larger wave in the middle of the tissue (constructive interference) or destructive interference with laser signals in opposite phase. However, the suprathreshold neural spikes were annihilated when they collided. Finally, the waves were not affected by the NMDA blocker (APV) and still propagated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) but at a significantly lower amplitude. The role of these subthreshold waves in neural function is unknown, but the results show that at low amplitude, the subthreshold propagating waves lack a refractory period allowing a novel analog form of preprocessing of neural activity by interference independent of synaptic transmission.</p>

	<p>Background: This study sought to determine whether (1) evidence is available of interactions between anodal tDCS and oscillated tDCS stimulation patterns to increase the power of endogenous brain oscillations and (2) the frequency matching the applied anodal otDCS&amp;amp;rsquo;s frequency and the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s dominant intrinsic frequency influence power shifting during stimulation pattern sessions by both anodal DCS and anodal oscillated DCS. Method: Rats received different anodal tDCS and otDCS stimulation patterns using 8.5 Hz and 13 Hz state-related dominant intrinsic frequencies of anodal otDCS. The rats were divided into groups with specific stimulation patterns: group A: tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (8.5 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (13 Hz); group B: otDCS (8.5 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (13 Hz); group C: otDCS (13 Hz)&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS (8.5 Hz). Acute relative power changes (i.e., following 10 min stimulation sessions) in six frequency bands&amp;amp;mdash;delta (1.5&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;7 Hz), alpha-1 (7&amp;amp;ndash;10 Hz), alpha-2 (10&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz), beta-1 (12&amp;amp;ndash;15 Hz) and beta-2 (15&amp;amp;ndash;20 Hz)&amp;amp;mdash;were compared using three factors and repeated ANOVA measurement. Results: For each stimulation, tDCS increased theta power band and, above bands alpha and beta, a drop in delta power was observed. Anodal otDCS had a mild increasing power effect in both matched intrinsic and delta bands. In group pattern stimulations, increased power of endogenous frequencies matched exogenous otDCS frequencies&amp;amp;mdash;8.5 Hz or 13 Hz&amp;amp;mdash;with more potent effects in upper bands. The power was markedly more potent with the otDCS&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS stimulation pattern than the tDCS&amp;amp;ndash;otDCS pattern. Significance: The findings suggest that the otDCS&amp;amp;ndash;tDCS pattern stimulation increased the power in matched intrinsic oscillations and, significantly, in the above bands in an ascending order. We provide evidence for the successful corporation between otDCS (as frequency-matched guidance) and tDCS (as a power generator) rather than tDCS alone when stimulating a desired brain intrinsic band (herein, tES specificity).</p>

	<p>Objectives: Hemispherotomy (HT) is a surgical option for treatment of drug-resistant seizures due to hemispheric structural lesions. Factors affecting seizure outcome have not been fully clarified. In our study, we used a brain Machine Learning (ML) approach to evaluate the possible role of Inter-hemispheric EEG Connectivity (IC) in predicting post-surgical seizure outcome. Methods: We collected 21 pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy; who underwent HT in our center from 2009 to 2020; with a follow-up of at least two years. We selected 5-s windows of wakefulness and sleep pre-surgical EEG and we trained Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to estimate epilepsy outcome. We extracted EEG features as input data and selected the ANN with best accuracy. Results: Among 21 patients, 15 (71%) were seizure and drug-free at last follow-up. ANN showed 73.3% of accuracy, with 85% of seizure free and 40% of non-seizure free patients appropriately classified. Conclusions: The accuracy level that we reached supports the hypothesis that pre-surgical EEG features may have the potential to predict epilepsy outcome after HT. Significance: The role of pre-surgical EEG data in influencing seizure outcome after HT is still debated. We proposed a computational predictive model, with an ML approach, with a high accuracy level.</p>

	<p>A large number of studies have studied the influence of emotional experience on an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation performance, but the influence of implicit emotion regulation is still unknown. Participants were asked to complete the following tasks in order: idiom matching task, multiplication computational estimation task (MCE task), gender judgment task (GJ task), and emotional experience intensity assessment task. The words matching task was adopted to achieve the purpose of implicit emotion regulation (implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression). Behavioral results showed that implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression equally contributed to improving an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation speed (but not ACC (accuracy)). The MCE task related ERP (event-related potential) results showed that the influence of implicit emotion regulation on estimation consisted of two phases. In the first phase (encoding phase), implicit reappraisal both enhanced (larger P1 amplitudes) and weakened (smaller N170 amplitudes) an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoding sensitivity, while implicit suppression enhanced an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s encoding sensitivity (larger P1 amplitudes). In the second phase (estimation strategies retrieval phase), implicit reappraisal (but not implicit suppression) cost more attention resources (larger LPC2 and LPC3 amplitudes). The present study suggested that both implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression contributed to improving an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s estimation performance, and the regulation effect of implicit suppression (vs. implicit reappraisal) was better.</p>

	<p>The association between impaired speech perception and reading difficulty has been well established in native language processing, as can be observed from brain activity. However, there has been scarce investigation of whether this association extends to brain activity during foreign language processing. The relationship between reading skills and neuronal speech representation of foreign language remains unclear. In the present study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) with high-density EEG to investigate this question. Eleven- to 13-year-old children typically developed (CTR) or with reading difficulties (RD) were tested via a passive auditory oddball paradigm containing native (Finnish) and foreign (English) speech items. The change-detection-related ERP responses, the mismatch response (MMR), and the late discriminative negativity (LDN) were studied. The cluster-based permutation tests within and between groups were performed. The results showed an apparent language effect. In the CTR group, we found an atypical MMR in the foreign language processing and a larger LDN response for speech items containing a diphthong in both languages. In the RD group, we found unstable MMR with lower amplitude and a nonsignificant LDN response. A deficit in the LDN response in both languages was found within the RD group analysis. Moreover, we observed larger brain responses in the RD group and a hemispheric polarity reversal compared to the CTR group responses. Our results provide new evidence that language processing differed between the CTR and RD groups in early and late discriminatory responses and that language processing is linked to reading skills in both native and foreign language contexts.</p>

	<p>Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare brain congenital malformation, consisting in altered neuronal migration and proliferation within one hemisphere, which is responsible for early onset drug-resistant epilepsy. Hemispherotomy is an effective treatment option for patients with HME and drug-resistant epilepsy. Surgical outcome may be variable among different surgical series, and the long-term neuropsychological trajectory has been rarely defined using a standardized neurocognitive test. We report the epileptological and neuropsychological long-term outcomes of four consecutive HME patients, operated on before the age of three years. All patients were seizure-free and drug-free, and the minimum follow-up duration was of five years. Despite the excellent post-surgical seizure outcome, the long-term developmental outcome is quite variable between patients, ranging from mild to severe intellectual disabilities. Patients showed improvement mainly in communication skills, while visuo-perceptive and coordination abilities were more impaired. Epileptological outcome seems to be improved in early treated patients; however, neuropsychological outcome in HME patients may be highly variable despite early surgery.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A fast lasso-based method for inferring higher-order interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kieran Elmes, Astra Heywood, Zhiyi Huang, Alex Gavryushkin</p>

Large-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alterations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify combinatorial gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Recently developed tools scale to human exome-wide screens for pairwise interactions, but none to date have included the possibility of three-way interactions. Expanding upon recent state-of-the-art methods, we make a number of improvements to the performance on large-scale data, making consideration of three-way interactions possible. We demonstrate our proposed method, Pint, on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens. Pint outperforms known methods in simulated data, and identifies a number of biologically plausible gene effects in both the antibiotic and siRNA models. For example, we have identified a combination of known tumour suppressor genes that is predicted (using Pint) to cause a significant increase in cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Development of hidden Markov modeling method for molecular orientations and structure estimation from high-speed atomic force microscopy time-series images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomonori Ogane, Daisuke Noshiro, Toshio Ando, Atsuko Yamashita, Yuji Sugita, Yasuhiro Matsunaga</p>

High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a powerful technique for capturing the time-resolved behavior of biomolecules. However, structural information in HS-AFM images is limited to the surface geometry of a sample molecule. Inferring latent three-dimensional structures from the surface geometry is thus important for getting more insights into conformational dynamics of a target biomolecule. Existing methods for estimating the structures are based on the rigid-body fitting of candidate structures to each frame of HS-AFM images. Here, we extend the existing frame-by-frame rigid-body fitting analysis to multiple frames to exploit orientational correlations of a sample molecule between H frames in HS-AFM data due to the interaction with the stage. In the method, we treat HS-AFM data as time-series data, and they are analyzed with the hidden Markov modeling. Using simulated HS-AFM images of the taste receptor type 1 as a test case, the proposed method shows a more robust estimation of molecular orientations than the frame-by-frame analysis. The method is applicable in integrative modeling of conformational dynamics using HS-AFM data.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Social health and cognitive change in old age: the role of brain reserve</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Individual aspects of social health (SH; e.g. network, engagement, support) have been linked to cognitive health. However, their combined effect, and the role of the structural properties of the brain (brain reserve, BR) remain unclear. We investigated the interplay of SH and BR on cognitive change in older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Within the Swedish National study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 368 dementia-free adults aged ≥60 years with baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging were followed over 12 years to assess cognitive change. A measure of global cognition was computed at each of the five waves of assessment by averaging domain-specific Z-scores for episodic memory, perceptual speed, semantic memory, letter and category fluency. An SH composite score was computed at baseline by combining leisure activities and social network. BR was proxied by total brain tissue volume (TBTV). Linear mixed models (adjusted for sociodemographic, vascular, and genetic factors) were used to estimate cognitive trajectories in relation to SH, TBTV. Interaction analysis and stratification were used to examine the interplay between SH and TBTV.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Moderate-good SH (n=245; vs. poor; β-slope=0.01 [95% CI 0.002, 0.02]; p=0.018) and moderate-to-large TBTV (n=245; vs. small; β-slope=0.03 [95% CI 0.02, 0.04]; p&lt;0.001) were separately associated with slower cognitive decline. In stratified analysis, moderate-good SH was associated with higher cognitive levels (but not change) only in participants with moderate-to-large TBTV (β-intercept=0.21 [95%CI 0.06; 0.37], p&lt;0.01; interaction SH*TBTV p&lt;0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight the interplay between social health and brain reserve that likely unfolds throughout the entire life course to shape old-age cognitive outcomes.</p>

<p>During reactive gliosis, Muller glia (1) initiate the posttranslational modification citrullination in Muller endfeet (2) via activation of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). Citrullinated glial fibrillary acidic protein (3) accumulates after laser injury in wild-type mice and feature retinal fibrosis (4), but this phenotype is not observed in glial-specific PAD4-specific KO mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retinal scarring with vision loss continues to be an enigma in individuals with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Müller glial cells are believed to initiate and perpetuate scarring in retinal degeneration as these glial cells participate in reactive gliosis and undergo hypertrophy. We previously showed in the murine laser-induced model of choroidal neovascularization that models wet-AMD that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, an early marker of reactive gliosis, increases along with its posttranslational modification citrullination. This was related to increased co-expression of the citrullination enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4), which also colocalizes to GFAP filaments. However, whether such hypercitrullination in Müller glial drives fibrotic pathology has remained understudied. Here, using male and female C57Bl6 mice subjected to laser injury, we investigated in a temporal study how citrullination impacts GFAP and PAD4 dynamics. We found that high molecular weight citrullinated species that accumulate in Müller glia corresponded with dynamic changes in GFAP and PAD4 showing their temporal redistribution from polymeric cytoskeletal to soluble protein fractions using immunostaining and western blot analysis. In conditional glial-specific PAD4 knockout (PAD4cKO) mice subjected to laser injury, there was a stark reduction of citrullination and of polymerized GFAP filaments. These injured PAD4cKO retinas showed improved lesion healing, as well as reduced fibronectin deposition in the subretinal space at 30 days. Taken together, these findings reveal that pathologically overexpressed PAD4 in reactive Müller glia governs GFAP filament dynamics and alters their stability, suggesting chronic PAD4-driven hypercitrullination may be a target for retinal fibrosis.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance (MR) metrics that are most sensitive to early changes in the brain in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3) using an advanced multimodal MR imaging (MRI) protocol in the multisite trial setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SCA1 or SCA3 mutation carriers and controls (n = 107) underwent MR scanning in the US-European READISCA study to obtain structural, diffusion MRI, and MR spectroscopy data using an advanced protocol at 3T. Morphometric, microstructural, and neurochemical metrics were analyzed blinded to diagnosis and compared between preataxic SCA (n = 11 SCA1, n = 28 SCA3), ataxic SCA (n = 14 SCA1, n = 37 SCA3), and control (n = 17) groups using nonparametric testing accounting for multiple comparisons. MR metrics that were most sensitive to preataxic abnormalities were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Atrophy and microstructural damage in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles and neurochemical abnormalities in the pons were prominent in both preataxic groups, when patients did not differ from controls clinically. MR metrics were strongly associated with ataxia symptoms, activities of daily living, and estimated ataxia duration. A neurochemical measure was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA1 (ROC area under the curve [AUC] = 0.95), and a microstructural metric was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA3 (AUC = 0.92).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Changes in cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways underlie the earliest symptoms of both SCAs. MR metrics collected with a harmonized advanced protocol in the multisite trial setting allow detection of disease effects in individuals before ataxia onset with potential clinical trial utility for subject stratification.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using two imaging modalities, that is, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) the present study tested associations between cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) burden and fornix microstructural changes with cognitive deficits in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), namely deficits in working memory (1-back) processing of visual object categories (faces, places, objects, bodies and verbal material). Second, we examined cortical Aβ associations with fornix microstructure. Seventeen early AD patients and 17 healthy-matched controls were included. Constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography was used to segment the fornix and a control tract the central branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (CB-SLF) previously implicated in working memory processes. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) of Aβ were extracted from 45 cortical/subcortical regions from the AAL atlas and subject to principal component analysis for data reduction. Patients exhibited (i) impairments in cognitive performance (ii) reductions in fornix fractional anisotropy (FA) and (iii) increases in a component that loaded highly on cortical Aβ. There were no group differences in CB-SLF FA and in a component loading highly on subcortical Aβ. Partial correlation analysis in the patient group showed (i) positive associations between fornix FA and performance for all the visual object categories and (ii) a negative association between the cortical Aβ component and performance for the object categories but not for the remaining classes of visual stimuli. A subsequent analysis showed a positive association between overall cognition (performance across distinct 1-back task conditions) with fornix FA but no association with cortical Aβ burden, in keeping with influential accounts on early onset AD. This indicates that the fornix degenerates early in AD and contributes to deficits in working memory processing of visual object categories; though it is also important to acknowledge the importance of prospective longitudinal studies with larger samples. Overall, the effect sizes of fornical degeneration on visual working memory appeared stronger than the ones related to amyloid burden.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein composition of axonal dopamine release sites in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is an important modulator of cognition and movement. We recently found that evoked dopamine secretion is fast and relies on active zone-like release sites. Here, we used in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to assess which proteins are present at these sites. Using three release site baits, we identified proteins that are enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content, and they fell into categories including active zone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with vesicular exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM strongly decreased the hit number obtained with iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. α-Synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease, was enriched at release sites, and its enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and provide a proteomic assessment of the composition of these sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Is calcium a link between inflammatory bone resorption and heart disease?</a></h4>

              
                Several epidemiologic studies associate bone-resorbing chronic inflammatory conditions with increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. These include post-menopausal osteoporosis, spinal cord injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Additional studies have noted that the use of anti-resorptive agents following hip fracture, during rheumatoid arthritis, and prior to intensive care management have resulted in reduced overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disorders. The careful study of burn patients has allowed us to detect that children and adolescents have a mechanism that protects them from the entry of calcium into the circulation following inflammatory bone resorption. That is, they respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by up-regulating the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) with consequent development of hypocalcemic hypoparathyroidism and hypercalciuria. As extracellular calcium appears to exacerbate and/or prolong the inflammatory response, this responsiveness of the CaSR to inflammatory cytokines may be the factor that reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In adults with chronic inflammatory conditions, the ability of the CaSR to respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines is lost, suggesting that the calcium that enters the circulation following inflammatory bone resorption may persist in the circulation, entering the small coronary blood vessels and favoring the formation of coronary artery calcification, inflammation, and consequent cardiovascular disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inducible lncRNA transgenic mice reveal continual role of HOTAIR in promoting breast cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                <i>HOTAIR</i> is a 2.2 kb long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) whose dysregulation has been linked to oncogenesis, defects in pattern formation during early development, and irregularities during the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the oncogenic transformation determined by <i>HOTAIR</i> in vivo and its impact on chromatin dynamics are incompletely understood. Here we generate a transgenic mouse model with doxycycline-inducible expression of human <i>HOTAIR</i> in the context of the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer-prone background to systematically interrogate the cellular mechanisms by which human <i>HOTAIR</i> lncRNA acts to promote breast cancer progression. We show that sustained high levels of <i>HOTAIR</i> over time increased breast metastatic capacity and invasiveness in breast cancer cells, promoting migration and subsequent metastasis to the lung. Subsequent withdrawal of <i>HOTAIR</i> overexpression reverted the metastatic phenotype, indicating oncogenic lncRNA addiction. Furthermore, <i>HOTAIR</i> overexpression altered both the cellular transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscape of multiple metastasis-associated genes and promoted epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These alterations are abrogated within several cell cycles after <i>HOTAIR</i> expression is reverted to basal levels, indicating an erasable lncRNA-associated epigenetic memory. These results suggest that a continual role for <i>HOTAIR</i> in programming a metastatic gene regulatory program. Targeting <i>HOTAIR</i> lncRNA may potentially serve as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate breast cancer progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional profiling of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome fibroblasts reveals deficits in mesenchymal stem cell commitment to differentiation related to early events in endochondral ossification</a></h4>

              
                The expression of a mutant Lamin A, progerin, in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome leads to alterations in genome architecture, nuclear morphology, epigenetic states, and altered phenotypes in all cells of the mesenchymal lineage. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional status of patient derived HGPS fibroblasts, including nine cell lines not previously reported, in comparison with age-matched controls, adults, and old adults. We find that Progeria fibroblasts carry abnormal transcriptional signatures, centering around several functional hubs: DNA maintenance and epigenetics, bone development and homeostasis, blood vessel maturation and development, fat deposition and lipid management, and processes related to muscle growth. Stratification of patients by age revealed misregulated expression of genes related to endochondral ossification and chondrogenic commitment in children aged four to seven years old, where this differentiation program starts in earnest.  Hi-C measurements on patient fibroblasts show weakening of genome compartmentalization strength but increases in TAD strength. While the majority of gene misregulation occurs in regions which do not change spatial chromosome organization, some expression changes in key mesenchymal lineage genes coincide with lamin associated domain misregulation and shifts in genome compartmentalization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clonally related, Notch-differentiated spinal neurons integrate into distinct circuits</a></h4>

              
                Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits. In <i>Drosophila</i>, in contrast, sister neurons with different levels of Notch expression (Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup>) develop distinct identities and diverge into separate circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here, we evaluate how sister V2a (Notch<sup>OFF</sup>)/V2b (Notch<sup>ON</sup>) neurons in the zebrafish integrate into spinal circuits. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have somata in close proximity to each other and similar axonal trajectories. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in <i>Drosophila</i> and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Working strokes produced by curling protofilaments at disassembling microtubule tips can be biochemically tuned and vary with species</a></h4>

              
                The disassembly of microtubules can generate force and drive intracellular motility. During mitosis, for example, chromosomes remain persistently attached via kinetochores to the tips of disassembling microtubules, which pull the sister chromatids apart. According to the conformational wave hypothesis, such force generation requires that protofilaments curl outward from the disassembling tips to exert pulling force directly on kinetochores. Rigorously testing this idea will require modifying the mechanical and energetic properties of curling protofilaments, but no way to do so has yet been described. Here, by direct measurement of working strokes generated in vitro by curling protofilaments, we show that their mechanical energy output can be increased by adding magnesium, and that yeast microtubules generate larger and more energetic working strokes than bovine microtubules. Both the magnesium and species-dependent increases in work output can be explained by lengthening the protofilament curls, without any change in their bending stiffness or intrinsic curvature. These observations demonstrate how work output from curling protofilaments can be tuned and suggest evolutionary conservation of the amount of curvature strain energy stored in the microtubule lattice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological Activity of Primary Cortical Neuron-Glia Mixed Cultures</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundWe have previously described a tri-culture of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia that accurately mimics the in vivo neuroinflammatory response (both neurotoxic and neuroprotective) to a wide range of neuroinflammatory stimuli. Electrophysiological activity is an essential measure of neuronal function, which is influenced by neuroinflammation. Microelectrode array (MEA) technology is a versatile tool to non-invasively study in vitro neural networks by simultaneously recording electrophysiological activity from multiple sites. In this study, we used extracellular recordings to determine the effect of microglia on neural network formation and stability in primary cortical cultures and monitor the changes in neural activity in response to neuroinflammatory stimuli.

MethodsPrimary neonatal rat cortical tri-cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia or co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes were cultured on custom MEAs and the neural activity was monitored for 21 days in vitro to assess culture maturation and network formation. Quantification of synaptic puncta and averaged spike waveforms were used to determine the difference in excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio (E/I ratio) of the neurons in tri- and co-cultures. The electrophysiological response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of both culture types were compared.

ResultsThe tri- and co-culture showed minimal difference in electrophysiological markers of neural network formation and stability with the exception of a significant increase in spike frequency in the tri-culture at later timepoints (DIV 17 and 21). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the density of either post-synaptic or excitatory pre-synaptic puncta between the culture types. However, characterization of the average spike waveforms revealed that the tri-culture had an E/I ratio much closer to that found in the rat cortex. Finally, only the tri-culture displayed a significant decrease in both the number of active channels and spike frequency following LPS exposure.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the microglia in the tri-culture do not disrupt neural network formation and stability as quantified using extracellular recordings and may be a better representation of the in vivo cortex due to the closer E/I ratio than more traditional isolated neuron and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Additionally, the tri-culture is better able to mimic the neuroinflammatory response to LPS, which was quantified via changes in neural electrophysiological activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of commercially available antisense oligonucleotides to reduce mouse and human tau in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, including Alzheimers disease (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of tau protein encoded by the MAPT (Microtubule Associated Protein Tau) gene. Various strategies targeting mechanisms to reduce tau pathology have been proposed and several tau-directed therapies are being investigated in clinical trials. Our lab previously developed a novel strategy to lower tau protein levels using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), showing that human tau (hTau) reduction in aged PS19 tauopathy mice reversed phosphorylated tau pathology, spared neurons, and prolonged survival. Currently, the tau-lowering ASO is being evaluated in the clinical trials with successful phase 1b results. Similarly, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the use of other ASOs as effective therapeutic strategies. Acquiring ASOs for research purposes may be limited by partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. However, ASOs can be obtained through commercial vendors. The current study evaluates the efficacy of mouse and human tau-targeting ASOs obtained from a commercial vendor in various mouse models. We show that mice treated with purchased ASOs distribute among various brain cell types including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Mice treated with tau lowering ASOs show decreased mouse or human tau mRNA and protein levels. In addition, human tau lowering ASO-treated PS19 mice showed decreased phosphorylated tau (AT8) and gliosis relative to saline-treated PS19 mice. The results obtained in PS19 mice are consistent with data obtained from our previous study using a non-commercial tau-lowering ASO. Overall, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of commercially-available tau targeting ASOs in vivo to support their broad use by researchers.

                Ants communicate via large arrays of pheromones and possess expanded, highly complex olfactory systems, with antennal lobes in the brain comprising ~500 glomeruli. This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher order processing. To study this problem, we generated the first transgenic ants, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated [&le;]6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic-alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representation of alarm pheromone cues. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and age specific effects on the development of addiction and compulsive-like drinking in rats</a></h4>

              
                Biological factors are known to influence disease trajectories and treatment effectiveness in alcohol addiction. One important biological factor influencing disease dynamics in alcohol use disorder is sex, as preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that gender influences disease trajectories in subjects with alcohol use disorder. Another critical factor is age at first intoxicating drink, which has been identified as a risk factor for later alcohol binging. Preclinical research allows prospective monitoring of rodents throughout the lifespan, providing very detailed information that cannot be acquired in humans. Lifetime monitoring in rodents can be conducted under highly controlled conditions, during which one can systematically introduce multiple biological and environmental factors that impact behaviors of interest.

Here, we used the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) rat model of alcohol addiction in a computerized drinkometer system to study disease dynamics and transition points of addictive behavior in cohorts of adolescent vs. adult as well as male vs. female rats in direct comparison. Early age of onset of drinking (postnatal day 40) in male rats had surprisingly little impact on the development of drinking behavior and compulsivity (quinine taste adulteration) when compared to rats that started drinking during early adulthood (postnatal day 72). However, female rats showed a stronger resistance to quinine taste adulteration after a history of ADEs, indicative of more pronounced compulsive behavior in females as compared to male rats. Specifically, female rats exhibit during quinine taste adulteration a higher frequency of drinking events and a larger access size, especially from the 20% alcohol solution, resulting in fast intoxication despite taste aversion in a relapse-like situation. Our results suggest that drinking patterns, and specifically solution preference as well as access size, provide a valuable indication into determining compulsive drinking. These findings provide a better understanding of sex and age factors involved in the development of drinking behavior that are important in preclinical development of models of addiction, drug development and exploration options for new treatments.

                SATB2 is genetically associated with human intelligence. Since SATB2 protein structure predicts a function in DNA looping, we analyzed the impact of SATB2 on 3D genome architecture and chromatin accessibility in cortical neurons. Our data reveal strong effects of SATB2 on chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters of neuronal activity-regulated genes, which closely correlate with gene expression. We furthermore identify SATB2-dependent alterations at all 3D genome architectural levels, including compartments, Topologically Associated Domains and Frequently Interacting Regions. Genes linked to SATB2-dependent 3D genome changes are implicated in highly specialized neuronal functions and contribute to cognitive ability and risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The altered non-coding regions are enriched for common variants associated with educational attainment, intelligence and schizophrenia. Our data establish SATB2 as a 3D genome organizer, which operates both independently and in cooperation with CTCF to set up the chromatin landscape of pyramidal neurons for cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrastructure of Precapillary Sphincters and the Neurovascular Unit</a></h4>

              
                Neurons communicate with vasculature to regulate blood flow in the brain. The cells that maintain this are collectively named the neurovascular unit (NVU). This communication, known as neurovascular coupling, is thought to involve astrocytes or molecules that can pass through the astrocytic endfeet. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear. Using large 3D electron microscopy datasets, we can now study the entire NVU in context. In this study, I provide evidence for the role of precapillary sphincters as a hub for neurovascular coupling and endothelial transcytosis, as well as the role of collagen synthesized by fibroblasts in strengthening first-order capillaries. I also show how astrocytic endfeet form a barrier for fluid flow and how the microvasculature of the cortex is not innervated but is surrounded by a surprising organization of parenchymal neuronal processes around penetrating arterioles and arterial-end capillaries in both mouse and human brains.

Significance statementThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is made up of various types of cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, which work together to regulate blood flow in response to changes in neural activity. This process, known as neurovascular coupling, is crucial for ensuring that the brain receives an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. This study suggests a novel organization of the NVU and neurovascular coupling. Through ultrastructural analysis, I was able to identify previously unknown relationships between the different types of cells in the NVU. These findings provide new insights into the structure of the NVU and how it functions, which may help researchers develop new strategies for preserving cognitive function and promoting healthy aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astroglial mediation of fast-acting antidepressant effect in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Rapid-acting antidepressants like ketamine hold promise to change the approach to treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but their cellular and molecular targets remain unclear. Passivity induced by behavioral futility underlies learned helplessness, a process that becomes maladaptive in MDD. Antidepressants decrease futility-induced passivity (FIP) in rodent models such as the forced swimming or tail suspension tasks, but these models lack the throughput and accessibility for screening compounds and investigating their effects on the brain in vivo. Therefore, we adapted a recently discovered FIP behavior in the small and optically accessible larval zebrafish to create a scalable behavioral assay for antidepressant action. We found that rapid-acting antidepressants with diverse pharmacological targets demonstrated a suppression of FIP conserved between fish and rodents. While fast-acting antidepressants are thought to primarily target neurons, using brain-wide imaging in vivo we found, surprisingly, that ketamine, but not psychedelics or typical antidepressants, drove cytosolic calcium elevation in astroglia lasting many minutes. Blocking neural activity did not prevent ketamine's effects on FIP or astroglial calcium, suggesting an astroglia-autonomous mechanism of ketamine's action. Chemogenetic and optogenetic perturbations of astroglia reveal that the aftereffects of calcium elevation are sufficient to suppress FIP by inhibiting astroglial integration of futile swimming. In sum, our work provides evidence that ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects by inhibiting an astroglial population that integrates futility and changes behavioral state. Astroglia play central roles in modulating circuit dynamics, and our work argues that targeting astroglial signaling may be a fruitful strategy for designing new rapid-acting antidepressants.

                Background: Processes that drive Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis have long been considered to occur within the central nervous system, yet recent studies have bolstered the possibility that changes in the periphery may be relevant to the disease process. Accumulating evidence has suggested that proteins changing in the blood may be reliable indicators of disease within the brain. Recent advances in geroscience have identified potential mechanisms of blood-brain communication that modulate brain function in ways that could be harnessed for therapy. While blood-borne proteins associated with either youth or old age have been targeted to restore function to the aged brain, it remains unclear whether other dysfunctional systemic states can be exploited for similar benefits. Here we investigate whether APOE allelic variation or presence of brain amyloid are associated with distinct proteomic changes within the systemic environment and what molecular processes are associated with these changes. Methods: Using the SOMAscan assay, we measured 1,305 plasma proteins from 53 homozygous APOE3 and APOE4 subjects (mean age = 68 years; minimum = 54 years) who exhibited no cognitive impairment, some of whom can be categorized as harboring cerebral amyloid based on cerebrospinal fluid A{beta}42 measurements. Using the Dream R package for linear mixed effects modeling, we investigated possible contributions of either the APOE-{epsilon}4 allele or amyloid positivity to changes in the plasma proteome. Ontology-based pathway and module trait correlation analyses were performed to understand disrupted pathways that vary based on APOE genotype or amyloid positivity. Results: We found that expression of the APOE-{epsilon}4 allele produced distinct changes in the composition of the plasma proteome. Using both pathway enrichment analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found that plasma proteins associated with APOE4 expression were linked to pathways related to atherosclerosis, lipid transport, the extracellular matrix, and synaptogenesis signaling. Independent of APOE4, we found that cognitively normal, amyloid-positive subjects exhibit distinct plasma proteome signatures associated with pathways previously linked to AD pathology, relative to amyloid-negative controls. Harboring brain amyloid was associated with plasma proteomic changes linked to dysfunction in blood-brain barrier and other neural cell types. Our results indicate that changes in the plasma proteome are related to possession of AD risk alleles, as well as the presence of amyloid pathology in subjects prior to the onset of symptoms. This work highlights the possibility that pathways in the systemic environment in certain risk contexts may be plausible targets to explore for modulating disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Numeracy and Literacy in the Human Brain: Insights from MEG and MVPA</a></h4>

              
                Numbers and letters are the fundamental building blocks of our everyday social interactions. Previous studies have focused on determining the cortical networks shaped by numeracy and literacy in the human brain, partially supporting the hypothesis of distinct neural circuits involved the processing of the two categories. In this study, we aim to investigate the temporal dynamics for number and letter processing. We present MEG data from two experiments (N=20 each). In the first experiment, single numbers, letter, and their respective false fonts (false numbers and false letters) were presented, whereas, in the second experiment, numbers, letters, and their respective false fonts were presented as a string of characters. We used multivariate pattern analysis techniques (time-resolved decoding and temporal generalization) testing the strong hypothesis that the neural mechanisms supporting letter and number processing can be logistically classified as categorically separate. Our results show a very early dissociation ([~]100 ms) between numbers, and letters when compared to false fonts. Number processing can be dissociated with similar accuracy when presented as isolated items or strings of characters, while letter processing shows dissociable classification accuracy for single items compared to strings. These findings reinforce the evidence indicating that early visual processing can be differently shaped by the experience with numbers and letters; this dissociation is stronger for strings compared to single items, thus showing that combinatorial mechanisms for numbers and letters could be categorically distinguished and influence early brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Displacement of extracellular chloride by sulfated glycosaminoglycans of the brain extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Membrane currents evoked by GABAA receptor activation have uniquely small driving forces: their reversal potential (EGABA) is very close to the resting membrane potential. As a consequence, GABAA currents can flow in either direction, depending on both the membrane potential and the local intra and extracellular concentrations of the primary permeant ion, chloride (Cl). Cytoplasmic Cl concentrations vary widely due to displacement of mobile Cl ions by relatively immobile anions. Here we describe new reporters of extracellular chloride (Cl-o) and demonstrate that Cl is displaced in the extracellular space by high and spatially heterogenous concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The mean Cl-o is only half the canonical concentration, i.e. the Cl concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cl-o microdomains provide a mechanism to link the highly stable distribution of GAGs in the brains extracellular space to neuronal signal processing via the effects on the amplitude and direction of GABAA transmembrane Cl currents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cost of multiplexing: PFC integrates multiple sources of information in non-orthogonal components accounting for behavioral variability</a></h4>

              
                The frontal eye field (FEF) is a prefrontal cortical area classically associated with spatial attention, perception, and oculomotor functions. FEF exhibits complex response properties through mixed selectivity neurons, allowing a high dimensional representation of the information. However, recent studies have shown that FEF encodes information in a low-dimensional regime hence limiting the coding capacity of the neural population. How the FEF encodes multiple sources of information with such limited encoding capacity remains elusive. To address this question, we trained two macaques to perform a visual attention task while we recorded FEF neuronal activity using multi-contact electrodes. FEF neurons encoded task- (spatial location of cue, POS; time in trial, CTOA) and behaviour- (reaction time, RT; focus of attention, TA) related parameters prior to target onset. We found a clear modulation of the RT and TA as a function of the CTOA. Using dPCA, we characterized the functional relationship between neural populations associated with each parameter and investigated how this functional relationship predicts behavior. We found that CTOA variability was associated to two different components the activation of which was correlated with the TA and the RT, respectively. These CTOA related components were non-orthogonal with the RT and TA related components. These results suggest that when different sources of information are implemented during task performance, they show a very precise geometrical configuration in non-orthogonal components. This allows high simultaneous information encoding capacity at the cost of an impaired capacity to use attention information and an enhanced responsiveness toward external stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human neurons lacking amyloid precursor protein exhibit cholesterol-associated developmental and presynaptic deficits</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces aggregable {beta}-amyloid peptides and its mutations are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, which makes it one of the most studied proteins. However, APP's role in the human brain remains unclear despite years of investigation. One problem is that most studies on APP have been carried out in cell lines or model organisms, which are physiologically different from human neurons in the brain. Recently, human-induced neurons (hiNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells provide a practical platform for studying the human brain in vitro. Here, we generated APP-null iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and differentiate them into matured human neurons with functional synapses using a two-step procedure. During hiN differentiation and maturation, APP-null cells exhibited less neurite growth and reduced synaptogenesis in serum-free but not serum-containing media. We have found that cholesterol (Chol) remedies those developmental defects in APP-null cells, consistent with Chol's role in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. The phenotypic rescue was also achieved by co-culturing those cells with wild-type mouse astrocytes, suggesting that APP's developmental role is likely astrocytic. Next, we examined matured hiNs using patch-clamp recording and detected reduced synaptic transmission in APP-null cells. This change was largely due to decreased synaptic vesicle (SV) release and retrieval, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging using two SV-specific fluorescent reporters. Adding Chol shortly before stimulation mitigated the SV deficits in APP-null iNs, indicating that APP facilitates presynaptic membrane Chol turnover during the SV exocytosis and endocytosis cycle. Taken together, our study in hiNs supports the notion that APP contributes to neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission via maintaining brain Chol homeostasis. Given the vital of Chol in the central nervous system, the functional connection between APP and Chol bears important implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolutionary divergence of basal and activity-dependent exon splicing in cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing of mRNA exons in mammalian neurons increases diversity of the proteome and is regulatable by signaling pathways. However, the degree of conservation of basal and signal-dependent exon usage between human neurons and those from experimental models such as mice is incompletely understood. We previously showed that cortical neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription exhibits human/mouse differences, driven by evolutionary divergence of cis-acting promoter elements (Qiu et al. 2016). Since alternative exon usage influences brain development and cognition, is controlled by neuronal activity, and is disturbed in brain disorders, we investigated human/mouse differences in exon usage in cortical neurons. Comparing orthologous exons, basal exon inclusion levels showed human-mouse conservation, but also significant differences determined by cis-acting sequences: human-mouse conservation and divergence in exon usage was recapitulated in neurons from Tc1 mice carrying human chromosome-21 (hCh21). Activity-dependent changes in exon usage also exhibited significant conservation: gene structure was more likely to be conserved in activity-regulated exons, and exons regulated in both human and mouse neurons were enriched in RBFOX and SAM68 targets, and genes were centred on cytoskeletal organisation, mRNA transcription/processing, and synaptic signaling. However, divergence was also evident, and human-specific activity-dependent exon usage was dominated by genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, signaling and trafficking. Notably, the pattern of activity-dependent usage of hCh21 exons in human neurons was not recapitulated in mouse Tc1 neurons. Thus, unlike species-specific differences in activity-dependent gene transcription, cis-acting DNA sequence divergence is insufficient to explain inter-species differences in activity-regulated exon usage. Trans-acting factors involved in activity-responsive splicing have likely also diverged.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis does not potentiate the effect of lipopolysaccharide insult in male Wistar rats</a></h4>

              
                The present study investigated whether neonatal exposure to the proinflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by antibiotic (ATB)-induced dysbiosis in early adulthood could induce schizophrenia-like behavioral changes in adult male rats. The combination of these two stressors resulted in decreased weight gain, but no significant behavioral abnormalities were observed. LPS treatment resulted in adult rats hypoactivity and induced anxiety-like behavior in the social recognition paradigm, but these behavioral changes were not exacerbated by ATB-induced gut dysbiosis. ATB treatment seriously disrupted the gut bacterial community, but dysbiosis did not affect locomotor activity, social recognition, and acoustic reactivity in adult rats. Fecal bacterial community analyzes showed no differences between the LPS challenge exposed/unexposed rats, while the effect of ATB administration was decisive regardless of prior LPS exposure. ATB treatment resulted in significantly decreased bacterial diversity, suppression of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, and increases in Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, and Burkholderiales. The persistent effect of LPS on some aspects of behavior suggests a long-term effect of early toxin exposure that was not observed in ATB-treated animals. However, an anti-inflammatory protective effect of ATB cannot be assumed because of the increased abundance of pro-inflammatory, potentially pathogenic bacteria (Proteus, Suttrella) and the elimination of the bacterial families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which are generally considered beneficial for gut health.

                Whole-brain three-dimensional (3D) imaging is desirable to obtain a comprehensive and unbiased view of architecture and neural circuitry. However, current spatial analytic methods for brain RNAs are limited to thin sections or small samples. Here, we combined multiple new techniques to develop TRIC-DISCO, a new pipeline that allows imaging of RNA spatial distributions in whole adult mouse brains. First, we developed Tris-mediated retention of in situ hybridization signal during clearing (TRIC), which produces highly transparent tissue while maintaining the RNA signal intensities. We then combined TRIC with DISCO clearing (TRIC-DISCO) by controlling temperature during the in situ hybridization chain reaction (isHCR) to ensure uniform whole-brain staining. This pipeline eliminates the requirements for both strict RNase-free environments and workflow-compatible RNase inhibitors. Our TRIC-DISCO pipeline enables simple and robust, single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging of transcriptional signatures, cell-identity markers, and noncoding RNAs across the entire brain.

                The effect of light, main zeitgeber of the circadian system, depends on the time of day it is received. A brief trip to the Antarctic summer (ANT) allowed us to explore the impact of a sudden and synchronized increase in light exposure on activity-rest rhythms and sleep patterns of 11 Uruguayan university students, and to assess the significance of light history in determining individual circadian phase shift. Measurements collected in the peri-equinox in Montevideo, Uruguay (baseline situation, MVD) and in ANT, included sleep logs, actigraphy, and salivary melatonin to determine dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), the most reliable marker of circadian phase. The increase in light exposure in ANT with respect to MVD (affecting both light-sensitive windows with opposite effects on the circadian phase) resulted in no net change in DLMO among participants as some participants advanced their DLMO and some others delayed it. The ultimate cause of each participants distinctive circadian phase shift relied on the unique change in light exposure each individual was subjected to between their MVD and ANT. This is the first study to show a clear physiological effect of light either advancing or delaying the circadian phase dependent on individual light history in an ecological study.

                Mutations in the single-copy RNU4ATAC gene, which encodes U4atac snRNA of the minor spliceosome are linked to the developmental disorder microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I). Partial loss-of-function mutations of U4atac snRNA lead to a poor prognosis, with less than three year survival. The most prominent characteristic of MOPD I is disrupted central nervous system development resulting in severe microcephaly and lissencephaly. In this study, we used self-organizing 3D cerebral organoids from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate defective cellular events that disturb the laminar organization of the cortex and influence brain topology. We analyzed organoids from iPSCs homozygous for the partial loss-of-function U4atac snRNA 51G>A mutation and compared them to isogenic organoids obtained from iPSCs expressing wild-type U4atac snRNA, using immunostaining and 10X Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing. In our MOPD I organoids, we observed: a) reduced proliferation accompanied by premature neurogenesis depleting the neuro-progenitor pool due to an increased frequency of horizontal cell divisions in the ventricular zone; b) reduced numbers of intermediate progenitor and outer radial glial cells in the outer sub-ventricular zone; and c) defective radial neuronal migration, which is critical for cortical expansion in humans. Our findings therefore provide insight into MOPD I cellular pathogenesis and underline the value of these cerebral organoids as model systems for human neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal TIMP2 regulates hippocampus-dependent plasticity and extracellular matrix complexity</a></h4>

              
                The functional output of the hippocampus, a brain region subserving memory processes, depends on highly orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity throughout life. However, little is known regarding the structural requirements of such plasticity and molecular processes involved in this regulation. Specific molecules, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) have been implicated in serving a pro-plasticity role within the hippocampus, a role that decreases with brain aging. Here, we report that TIMP2 is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus by neurons and its loss in TIMP2 KO mice drives changes in cellular programs related to adult neurogenesis and dendritic spine turnover with corresponding impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory performance. We find that TIMP2 regulates the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) around synapses in the hippocampus with concomitant hindrance in the migration of newborn neurons through a denser ECM network. Deleting the neuronal pool of TIMP2 using a conditional TIMP2 KO mouse reveals that neuronal TIMP2 regulates adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory, as well as accumulation of ECM. Our results define a mechanism whereby hippocampus-dependent function is regulated by TIMP2 and its interactions with the ECM to regulate diverse processes associated with synaptic plasticity.

                Periaqueductal gray (PAG) columns mediate affective experience, physiological regulation, and survival-related behavior; yet, only 7T imaging can resolve these small structures in humans. In a social stress task, participants prepared a speech, and we observed (a) bilateral ventrolateral PAG activity, relative to baseline, and (b) distinct spatial patterns of correlation between PAG activity and physiological response (i.e., cardiac interbeat interval, reparation rate, and tonic electrodermal activity).

                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a global healthcare crisis. The TgF344-AD rat is an AD model exhibiting age-dependent AD pathological hallmarks. We confirmed that AD rats developed cognitive deficits at 6 months without alteration of any other major biophysical parameters. We longitudinally characterized cerebral hemodynamics in AD rats at 3, 4, 6, and 14 months. The myogenic responses of the cerebral arteries and arterioles were impaired at 4 months of age in the AD rats. Consistent with the ex vivo results, the AD rat exhibited poor autoregulation of surface and deep cortical cerebral blood flow two months preceding cognitive decline. The dysfunction of cerebral hemodynamics in AD is exacerbated with age associated with reduced cerebral perfusion. Further, abolished cell contractility contributes to cerebral hemodynamics imbalance in AD. This may be attributed to enhanced ROS production, reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, and disrupted actin cytoskeleton in cerebral vascular contractile cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Open-Source Rodent Chronic EEG Array System with High Density MXene-Based Skull Surface Electrodes</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is an indispensable tool in epilepsy, sleep, and behavioral research. In rodents, EEG recordings are typically performed with metal electrodes that traverse the skull into the epidural space. In addition to requiring a major surgery, this intracranial EEG technique is difficult to perform for more than a few electrodes, is time-intensive, and confounds experiments studying traumatic brain injury. Here, we describe an open-source cost-effective refinement of this technique for chronic mouse EEG recording. Our alternative two channel (EEG2) and sixteen channel high-density EEG (HdEEG) arrays use electrodes made of the novel, flexible 2D nanomaterial titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene. The MXene electrodes are placed on the surface of the intact skull and establish electrical connection without conductive gel or paste. Fabrication and implantation times of MXene EEG electrodes are significantly shorter than the standard approach and recorded resting baseline and epileptiform EEG waveforms are similar to those obtained with traditional epidural electrodes. Applying HdEEG to a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) model in mice of both sexes revealed that mTBI significantly altered awake resting state spectral density with a spatiospectral region of interest in the {beta} spectral band (12-30 Hz) in the central and posterior regions. These findings indicate that fabrication of MXene electrode arrays is a cost effective, efficient technology for multichannel EEG recording in rodents that obviates the need for skull-penetrating surgery. Moreover, increased {beta} spectral power may contribute to the development of early post-mTBI seizures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Understanding prefrontal cortex functions by decoding its molecular, cellular and circuit organization</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is functionally one of the most complex regions of mammalian brain. Unlike other cortical areas that process single sensory modalities (like vision, touch, smell etc.), the PFC integrates information across brain regions to regulate diverse functions ranging from cognition, emotion, executive action to even pain sensitivity. However, it is unclear how such diverse functions are organized at the cellular and circuit levels within the anatomical modules of the PFC. Here we employed spatially resolved single cell profiling to decode PFC's organizational heterogeneity. The results revealed that PFC has very distinct cell type composition relative to all neighboring cortical areas. Interestingly, PFC adopts specialized transcriptional features, distinct from all neighbors, with differentially express genes regulating neuronal excitability. Additionally, projections of PFC neuron subclusters to major subcortical targets are determined in a target-intrinsic fashion. These cellular and molecular features further segregated within subregions of PFC, alluding to the subregion-specific specialization of several PFC functions. Finally, to exemplify the utility of these unique cellular, molecular and projection properties, we identified distinct cell types and circuits in PFC engaging in pathogenesis of chronic pain. Collectively, we not only present a comprehensive organizational map of the PFC, critical for supporting its diverse functions, but also reveal the cluster and circuit identity of a pathway underlying chronic pain pathogenesis, which paves ways for mechanistic understanding and potential interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Origin of wiring specificity in an olfactory map: dendrite targeting of projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                How does wiring specificity of neural maps emerge during development? Formation of the adult Drosophila olfactory glomerular map begins with patterning of projection neuron (PN) dendrites at the early pupal stage. To better understand the origin of wiring specificity of this map, we created genetic tools to systematically characterize dendrite patterning across development at PN type-specific resolution. We find that PNs use lineage and birth order combinatorially to build the initial dendritic map. Specifically, birth order directs dendrite targeting in rotating and binary manners for PNs of the anterodorsal and lateral lineages, respectively. Two-photon- and adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscope-based time-lapse imaging reveals that PN dendrites initiate active targeting with direction-dependent branch stabilization on the timescale of seconds. Moreover, PNs that are used in both the larval and adult olfactory circuits prune their larval-specific dendrites and re-extend new dendrites simultaneously to facilitate timely olfactory map organization. Our work highlights the power and necessity of type-specific neuronal access and time-lapse imaging in identifying wiring mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of functional neural maps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disease-modifying effects of Vincamine supplementation in Drosophila and human cell models of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Current therapies are only symptomatic, and are not able to stop or delay its progression. In order to search new and more effective therapies, our group carried out a high-throughput screening assay, identifying several candidate compounds able to suppress motor defects in DJ-1{beta} mutant flies (a Drosophila model of familial PD) and to reduce oxidative stress (OS)-induced lethality in DJ-1-deficient SH-SY5Y human cells. One of them was vincamine (VIN), a natural alkaloid obtained from the leaves of Vinca minor. Our results showed that VIN is able to suppress PD-related phenotypes in both Drosophila and human cell PD models. Specifically, VIN reduced OS levels in PD model flies. Besides, VIN diminished OS-induced lethality by decreasing apoptosis, increased mitochondrial viability and reduced OS levels in DJ-1-deficient human cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that VIN is able to exert its beneficial role, at least partially, by the inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Therefore, we propose that these channels might be a promising target in the search for new compounds to treat PD, and that VIN constitutes a potential therapeutic treatment for the disease.

                Thalamus provides the principal input to cortex, thus understanding the mechanisms of cortical computations in behaving animals requires to characterize the thalamocortical connectivity in vivo. We show that tangential insertions of high-density electrodes into mouse cortex capture the activity of thalamocortical axons simultaneously with their synaptically connected cortical neurons. Multiple thalamic synaptic inputs to cortical neurons can be measured providing an efficient approach for mapping the thalamocortical connectivity in vivo.

	<p>The corticocortical vestibular network (CVN) plays an important role in maintaining balance and stability. In order to clarify the specific relationship between the CVN and the balance ability of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we recruited 30 MCI patients in the community. According to age and sex, they were 1:1 matched to 30 older adults with normal cognitive function. We evaluated balance ability and performed MRI scanning in the two groups of participants. We analyzed functional connectivity within the CVN based on the region of interest. Then, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the functional connection and the Berg Balance Scale scores. The research results show that compared with the control group, there were three pairs of functional connections (hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R, PFcm_R&amp;amp;ndash;SMA_L, and hMST_L&amp;amp;ndash;VIP_R) that were significantly decreased in the CVNs of the MCI group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Further correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between hMST_R&amp;amp;ndash;Premotor_R functional connectivity and BBS score (r = 0.364, p = 0.004). The decline in balance ability and increase in fall risk in patients with MCI may be closely related to the change in the internal connection mode of the corticocortical vestibular network.</p>

	<p>Background: Monitoring the depth of anesthesia by electroencephalogram (EEG) based on the prefrontal cortex is an important means to achieve accurate regulation of anesthesia for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) under general anesthesia in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). However, no previous study has conducted an in-depth investigation into this monitoring data. Here, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of prefrontal cortex EEG during DBS with propofol general anesthesia in patients with PD and determine the reference range of parameters derived from the depth of anesthesia monitoring. Additionally, we attempted to explore whether the use of benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery impacted the interpretation of the EEG parameters. Materials and Methods: We included the data of 43 patients with PD who received STN DBS treatment and SedLine monitoring during the entire course of general anesthesia with propofol in a single center. Eighteen patients (41.86%) took benzodiazepines during hospitalization. We divided the anesthesia process into three stages: awake state before anesthesia, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia state during microelectrode recording (MER). We analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) and derived parameters of the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prefrontal EEG, including the patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF) of the left and right sides, and the suppression ratio. The baseline characteristics, preoperative medication, preoperative frontal lobe image characteristics, preoperative motor and non-motor evaluation, intraoperative vital signs, internal environment and anesthetic information, and postoperative complications are listed. We also compared the groups according to whether they took benzodiazepines before surgery during hospitalization. Results: The average PSI of the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and MER state were 89.86 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.89, 48.68 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.65, and 62.46 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.08, respectively. The preoperative administration of benzodiazepines did not significantly affect the PSI or SEF, but did reduce the total time of suppression, maximum suppression ratio, and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER. Regarding the occurrence of postoperative delirium and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi-square test, p = 0.48; Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, p = 0.30). Conclusion: For the first time, we demonstrate the reference range of the derived parameters of the depth of anesthesia monitoring and the characteristics of the prefrontal EEG of patients with PD in the awake state, propofol anesthesia state, and shallow anesthesia during MER. Taking benzodiazepines in the 3 days during hospitalization before surgery reduces suppression and the PSD of beta and gamma during MER, but does not significantly affect the observation of anesthesiologists on the depth of anesthesia, nor affect the postoperative delirium and MMSE scores.</p>

	<p>The investigation of the perception of others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and underlying neural mechanisms has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive stimulus set covering the human behavioral repertoire. To fill this void, we present a video set showing 100 human actions recorded in natural settings, covering the human repertoire except for emotion-driven (e.g., sexual) actions and those involving implements (e.g., tools). We validated the set using fMRI and showed that observation of the 100 actions activated the well-established action observation network. We also quantified the videos&amp;amp;rsquo; low-level visual features (luminance, optic flow, and edges). Thus, this comprehensive video set is a valuable resource for perceptual and neuronal studies.</p>

	<p>Cholinergic muscarinic stimulation of vast areas of the limbic brain induced a well-documented polydipsia in laboratory rats. This excessive water-drinking behavior has not received any convincing biological and physiological interpretation for the last 50 years. This review offers such an interpretation and suggests that cholinergically induced drinking response, mostly by carbachol, is associated with activation of the ascending mesolimbic cholinergic system that serves for initiation of emotional aversive arousal of the organism. The ascending cholinergic system originates from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, has a diffuse nature, and affects numerous subcortical limbic structures. It is proposed that the carbachol-induced drinking response is related to the state of anxiety and does not serve the regulation of thirst. Instead, the response is anxiety-induced polydipsia that might occur as a soothing procedure that decreases the aversiveness of the negative emotional state induced by carbachol. It is concluded that carbachol-induced water-drinking behavior is a rewarding process that contributes to alleviating the feeling of anxiety by bringing some relief from the cholinergically induced aversive state, and it is a homologue to anxiety-driven polydipsia in humans.</p>

	<p>Background: Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective method for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). However, safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity is rarely focused and reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of STN-DBS treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Methods: We retrospectively included PD patients with CVD comorbidity who underwent STN-DBS under general anesthesia in our center from January 2019 to January 2021. Patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s PD symptoms and cardiopulmonary function were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before surgery. Post-operative clinical outcome and complications were collected until 1-year follow-up. Results: A total of 38 patients (26 men/12 women) of mean body mass index (BMI) 24.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.11 kg/m2, with different CVD comorbidity were finally speculated in the study. These CVD include mainly hypertension, coronary artery disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm, heart valve replacement, pacemaker implantation, atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and so on. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 38 patients at admission day, pre-operation day, and discharge day timepoint was 135.63 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.08 mmHg, 137.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.26 mmHg, and 126.87 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.36 mmHg, respectively. This showed that blood pressure was controlled well under stable and normal state. The indicators of myocardial infarction Troponin T (Tn T-T) levels at pre-operation, 1 day and 7 days after operation timepoint were 0.014 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.011 ng/mL, 0.015 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.011 ng/mL, and 0.014 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.008 ng/mL, showing no significant fluctuation (F = 0.038, p = 0.962). STN-DBS improved PD patients&amp;amp;rsquo; UPDRS III scores by 51.38% (t = 12.33, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) at 1-year follow-up compared with pre-operative baseline. A total of 11 adverse events were recorded until 1-year follow-up. No obvious cardiovascular complications such as intracranial hematoma or clot-related events occurred within 1 year after surgery except 1 case of hematuria. Conclusions: STN-DBS under general anesthesia is safe and effective for treating PD patients with CVD comorbidity. Our clinical experience and protocol of the MDT offers comprehensive perioperative evaluation for DBS surgery and mitigates bleeding and cardiovascular-associated events in PD patients with CVD comorbidity.</p>

	<p>Approximately two-thirds of stroke survivors experience chronic upper-limb paresis; however, treatment options are limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enhance motor function recovery in stroke survivors, but its efficacy is controversial. We compared the efficacy of stimulating different targets in 10 chronic stroke patients with severe upper-limb motor impairment. Motor imagery-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface training augmented with virtual reality was used to induce neural activity in the brain region during an imagery task. Participants were then randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group (received high-frequency rTMS delivered to the brain region activated earlier) and a comparison group (received low-frequency rTMS delivered to the contralesional primary motor cortex). Behavioural metrics and diffusion tensor imaging were compared pre- and post rTMS. After the intervention, participants in both groups improved somewhat. This preliminary study indicates that in chronic stroke patients with severe upper-limb motor impairment, inducing activation in specific brain regions during motor imagery tasks and selecting these regions as a target is feasible. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy of this intervention.</p>

	<p>Why do neurons communicate through spikes? By definition, spikes are all-or-none neural events which occur at continuous times. In other words, spikes are on one side binary, existing or not without further details, and on the other, can occur at any asynchronous time, without the need for a centralized clock. This stands in stark contrast to the analog representation of values and the discretized timing classically used in digital processing and at the base of modern-day neural networks. As neural systems almost systematically use this so-called event-based representation in the living world, a better understanding of this phenomenon remains a fundamental challenge in neurobiology in order to better interpret the profusion of recorded data. With the growing need for intelligent embedded systems, it also emerges as a new computing paradigm to enable the efficient operation of a new class of sensors and event-based computers, called neuromorphic, which could enable significant gains in computation time and energy consumption&amp;amp;mdash;a major societal issue in the era of the digital economy and global warming. In this review paper, we provide evidence from biology, theory and engineering that the precise timing of spikes plays a crucial role in our understanding of the efficiency of neural networks.</p>

	<p>What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area (left BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (left medial BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of left BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of left medial BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in school-age children. Although it has been well documented that children with ADHD are associated with impairment of executive functions including working memory (WM) and inhibitory control, there is not yet a consensus as to the relationship between ADHD and memory-driven attentional capture (i.e., representations in WM bias attention toward the WM-matched distractors). The present study herein examined whether children with ADHD have sufficient cognitive control to modulate memory-driven attentional capture. 73 school-age children (36 with ADHD and 37 matched typically developing (TD) children) were instructed to perform a visual search task while actively maintaining an item in WM. In such a paradigm, the modality and the validity of the memory sample were manipulated. The results showed that under the visual WM encoding condition, no memory-driven attentional capture was observed in TD children, but significant capture was found in children with ADHD. In addition, under the audiovisual WM encoding condition, memory-matched distractors did not capture the attention of both groups. The results indicate a deficit of cognitive control over memory-driven attentional capture in children with ADHD, which can be improved by multisensory WM encoding. These findings enrich the relationship between ADHD and cognitive control and provide new insight into the influence of cross-modal processing on attentional guidance.</p>

	<p>Completely locked-in (CLIS) patients are characterized by sufficiently intact cognitive functions, but a complete paralysis that prevents them to interact with their surroundings. On one hand, studies have shown that the ability to communicate plays an important part in these patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and prognosis. On the other hand, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for them to communicate using their brain signals. However, one major problem for such patients is the difficulty to determine if they are conscious or not at a specific time. This work aims to combine different sets of features consisting of spectral, complexity and connectivity measures, to increase the probability of correctly estimating CLIS patients&amp;amp;rsquo; consciousness levels. The proposed approach was tested on data from one CLIS patient, which is particular in the sense that the experimenter was able to point out one time frame &amp;amp;Delta;t during which he was undoubtedly conscious. Results showed that the method presented in this paper was able to detect increases and decreases of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s consciousness levels. More specifically, increases were observed during this &amp;amp;Delta;t, corroborating the assertion of the experimenter reporting that the patient was definitely conscious then. Assessing the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; consciousness is intended as a step prior attempting to communicate with them, in order to maximize the efficiency of BCI-based communication systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Limbic Connectivity Underlies Pain Treatment Response in Small‐Fiber Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is characterized by neuropathic pain due to degeneration of small-diameter nerves in the skin. Given that brain reorganization occurs following chronic neuropathic pain, this study investigated the structural and functional basis of pain-related brain changes after skin nerve degeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 53 pathologically confirmed SFN patients, and the structural and functional connectivity of the pain-related network was assessed using network-based statistic (NBS) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, the SFN patients exhibited a robust and global reduction of functional connectivity, mainly across the limbic and somatosensory systems. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity was associated with skin nerve degeneration measured by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and better therapeutic response to anti-neuralgia medications, particularly for the connectivity between the insula and the limbic areas including the anterior and middle cingulate cortices. Similar to the patterns of functional connectivity changes, the structural connectivity was robustly reduced among the limbic and somatosensory areas, and the cognition-integration areas including the inferior parietal lobule. There was shared reduction of structural and functional connectivity among the limbic, somatosensory, striatal, and cognition-integration systems: (1) between the middle cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule and (2) between the thalamus and putamen. These observations indicate the structural basis underlying altered functional connectivity in SFN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide imaging evidence linking structural and functional brain dysconnectivity to sensory deafferentation caused by peripheral nerve degeneration and therapeutic responses for neuropathic pain in SFN. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is composed of various subregions: CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG). Despite the abundant hippocampal research literature, until recently, CA2 received little attention. The development of new genetic and physiological tools allowed recent studies characterizing the unique properties and functional roles of this hippocampal subregion. Despite its small size, the cellular content of CA2 is heterogeneous at the molecular and physiological levels. CA2 has been heavily implicated in social behaviors, including social memory. More generally, the mechanisms by which the hippocampus is involved in memory include the reactivation of neuronal ensembles following experience. This process is coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Recent evidence suggests that CA2 plays an important role in the generation of SWRs. The unique connectivity and physiological properties of CA2 pyramidal cells make this region a computational hub at the core of hippocampal information processing. Here, we review recent findings that support the role of CA2 in coordinating hippocampal network dynamics from a systems neuroscience perspective.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mature parvalbumin interneuron function in prefrontal cortex requires activity during a postnatal sensitive period</a></h4>

              
                In their seminal findings, Hubel and Wiesel identified sensitive periods in which experience can exert lasting effects on adult visual cortical functioning and behavior via transient changes in neuronal activity during development. Whether comparable sensitive periods exist for non-sensory cortices, such as the prefrontal cortex, in which alterations in activity determine adult circuit function and behavior is still an active area of research. Here, using mice we demonstrate that inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons during the juvenile and adolescent period, results in <i>persistent</i> impairments in adult prefrontal circuit connectivity, in vivo network function, and behavioral flexibility that can be reversed by targeted activation of PV interneurons in adulthood. In contrast, reversible suppression of PV interneuron activity in adulthood produces no lasting effects. These findings identify an activity-dependent sensitive period for prefrontal circuit maturation and highlight how abnormal PV interneuron activity during development alters adult prefrontal circuit function and cognitive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning-driven insights into super protein complexes for outer membrane protein biogenesis in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                To reach their final destinations, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria undertake an eventful journey beginning in the cytosol. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. These helpers usually associate, often transiently, forming large protein assemblies. They are not well understood due to experimental challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially transient ones. Using AF2Complex, we introduce a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline to identify PPIs within the <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, we find not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predict atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations and lead to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase essential for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and blood stage development in the malaria parasite</a></h4>

              
                The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes significant amounts of phospholipids to meet the demands of replication within red blood cells. De novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway is essential, requiring choline that is primarily sourced from host serum lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). LysoPC also acts as an environmental sensor to regulate parasite sexual differentiation. Despite these critical roles for host lysoPC, the enzyme(s) involved in its breakdown to free choline for PC synthesis are unknown. Here we show that a parasite glycerophosphodiesterase (PfGDPD) is indispensable for blood stage parasite proliferation. Exogenous choline rescues growth of PfGDPD-null parasites, directly linking PfGDPD function to choline incorporation. Genetic ablation of PfGDPD reduces choline uptake from lysoPC, resulting in depletion of several PC species in the parasite, whilst purified PfGDPD releases choline from glycerophosphocholine in vitro. Our results identify PfGDPD as a choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase that mediates a critical step in PC biosynthesis and parasite survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Computational design of peptides to target NaV1.7 channel with high potency and selectivity for the treatment of pain</a></h4>

              
                The voltage-gated sodium Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel plays a key role as a mediator of action potential propagation in C-fiber nociceptors and is an established molecular target for pain therapy. ProTx-II is a potent and moderately selective peptide toxin from tarantula venom that inhibits human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 activation. Here we used available structural and experimental data to guide Rosetta design of potent and selective ProTx-II-based peptide inhibitors of human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels. Functional testing of designed peptides using electrophysiology identified the PTx2-3127 and PTx2-3258 peptides with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 7 nM and 4 nM for hNa<sub>V</sub>1.7 and more than 1,000-fold selectivity over human Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 channels. PTx2-3127 inhibits Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 currents in mouse and human sensory neurons and shows efficacy in rat models of chronic and thermal pain when administered intrathecally. Rationally-designed peptide inhibitors of human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels have transformative potential to define a new class of biologics to treat pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fiber-specific structural properties relate to reading skills in children and adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that the cross-sectional relationship between reading skills and white matter microstructure, as indexed by fractional anisotropy, is not as robust as previously thought. Fixel-based analyses yield fiber-specific micro- and macrostructural measures, overcoming several shortcomings of the traditional diffusion tensor model. We ran a whole-brain analysis investigating whether the product of fiber density and cross-section (FDC) related to single-word reading skills in a large, open, quality-controlled data set of 983 children and adolescents ages 6-18. We also compared FDC between participants with (n = 102) and without (n = 570) reading disabilities. We found that FDC positively related to reading skills throughout the brain, especially in left temporoparietal and cerebellar white matter, but did not differ between reading proficiency groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that among metrics from other diffusion models - DTI, DKI, and NODDI - only the orientation dispersion and neurite density indexes from NODDI were associated (inversely) with reading skills. The present findings further support the importance of left-hemisphere dorsal temporoparietal white matter tracts in reading. Additionally, these results suggest future DWI studies of reading and dyslexia should be designed to benefit from advanced diffusion models, include cerebellar coverage, and consider continuous analyses that account for individual differences in reading skill.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ultrastructural effects of sleep and wake on the parallel fiber synapses of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Multiple evidence in rodents shows that the strength of excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is greater after wake than after sleep. The widespread synaptic weakening afforded by sleep is believed to keep the cost of synaptic activity under control, promote memory consolidation, and prevent synaptic saturation, thus preserving the brain’s ability to learn day after day. The cerebellum is highly plastic and the Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are endowed with a staggering number of excitatory parallel fiber synapses. However, whether these synapses are affected by sleep and wake is unknown. Here, we used serial block face scanning electron microscopy to obtain the full 3D reconstruction of more than 7000 spines and their parallel fiber synapses in the mouse posterior vermis. This analysis was done in mice whose cortical and hippocampal synapses were previously measured, revealing that average synaptic size was lower after sleep compared to wake with no major changes in synapse number. Here, instead, we find that while the average size of parallel fiber synapses does not change, the number of branched synapses is reduced in half after sleep compared to after wake, corresponding to ~16% of all spines after wake and ~8% after sleep. Branched synapses are harbored by two or more spines sharing the same neck and, as also shown here, are almost always contacted by different parallel fibers. These findings suggest that during wake, coincidences of firing over parallel fibers may translate into the formation of synapses converging on the same branched spine, which may be especially effective in driving Purkinje cells to fire. By contrast, sleep may promote the off-line pruning of branched synapses that were formed due to spurious coincidences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of evidence for increased transcriptional noise in aged tissues</a></h4>

              
                Aging is often associated with a loss of cell type identity that results in an increase in transcriptional noise in aged tissues. If this phenomenon reflects a fundamental property of aging remains an open question. Transcriptional changes at the cellular level are best detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). However, the diverse computational methods used for the quantification of age-related loss of cellular identity have prevented reaching meaningful conclusions by direct comparison of existing scRNAseq datasets. To address these issues we created Decibel, a Python toolkit that implements side-to-side four commonly used methods for the quantification of age-related transcriptional noise in scRNAseq data. Additionally, we developed Scallop, a novel computational method for the quantification of membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater Scallop membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. To understand the source of apparent loss of cell type identity associated with aging, we analyzed cell type-specific changes in transcriptional noise and the changes in cell type composition of the mammalian lung. No robust pattern of cell type-specific transcriptional noise alteration was found across aging lung datasets. In contrast, age-associated changes in cell type composition of the lung were consistently found, particularly of immune cells. These results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Maximizing CRISPRi efficacy and accessibility with dual-sgRNA libraries and optimal effectors</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.

                The coadaptation or genetic coupling of senders and receivers of sex signals in some animals has been described, but no empirical evidence shows whether sex pheromones and their receptors undergo coadaptation in mammals. In this study of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), we found markedly higher levels of two predominant male pheromones (2-heptanone and MUP13) in the North China subspecies [R. n. humiliatus (RNH)] than in the Northeast China subspecies [R. n. caraco (RNC)] by gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Coincidently, two vomeronasal receptor genes (Vom1r68 and Vom2r53) were found to be expressed at higher levels in RNH females than in RNC females and were thus considered candidate receptors for 2-heptanone and MUP13, respectively. An immunofluorescence analysis showed that these two VR receptors colocalized with mTmG on the membrane of HEK293-T cells. We also verified the responsiveness of Vom1r68 to 2-heptanone and Vom2r53 to MUP13 in HEK293-T cells by calcium imaging. In conclusion, we screened and identified the receptors of two pheromones based on the coadaptation of pheromones and their receptors, which further verified their coevolution.

	<p>Activated microglia potentially cause neurodegeneration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, but the modulator of microglial release of MMP-9 remains obscure. Given the modulatory effect of chloride intracellular channel protein 2 (CLIC2) on MMPs, we aimed to determine the role of CLIC2 in regulating microglial MMP expression and activation. We found that CLIC2 is expressed in microglia and neurons in rat brain tissue and focused on the function of CLIC2 in primary cultured microglia. Exposure to recombinant CLIC2 protein enhanced microglial invasion activity, and its knockdown abolished this activity. Moreover, increased activation of MMP-9 was confirmed by the addition of the CLIC2 protein, and CLIC2 knockdown eliminated this activation. Additionally, increased expression of CLIC2 was observed in PD-modeled tissue. In conclusion, CLIC2 increases MMP-9 activity in the microglia, which are involved in PD pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Objective: To compare established clinical outcome assessments for predicting behind the wheel driving readiness and driving simulator results across age groups and in traumatic brain injury. Methods: Participants included adults who had a traumatic brain injury ranging in age from 31 to 57 years and a non-impaired adult population ranging in age from 18 to 80 years. Physical and cognitive outcomes measures were collected included range of motion and coordination, a &amp;amp;ldquo;Rules of the Road Test&amp;amp;rdquo; a &amp;amp;ldquo;Sign Identification Test,&amp;amp;rdquo; Trails A and B, and the clock drawing test. Visual measures included the Dynavision D2 system and motor-free visual perceptual test-3 (MVPT-3). Finally, the driving simulators (STI&amp;amp;Ograve; version M300) metro drive assessment was used, which consisted of negotiating several obstacles in a metropolitan area including vehicles abruptly changing lanes, pedestrians crossing streets, and negotiating construction zones. Results: Our findings suggest that the standard paper-pencil cognitive assessments and sign identification test significantly differentiate TBI from a non-impaired population (Trails A, B and Clock drawing test p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). While the driving simulator did not show as many robust differences with age, the TBI population did have a significantly greater number of road collisions (F3, 78 = 3.5, p = 0.02). We also observed a significant correlation between the cognitive assessments and the simulator variables. Conclusions: Paper-pencil cognitive assessments and the sign identification test highlight greater differences than the STI Driving Simulator between non-impaired and TBI populations. However, the driving simulator may be useful in assessing cognitive ability and training for on the road driving.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that children with Communication Disorders (CDs) may show gross, fine, and visual-motor difficulties compared to children with typical development. Accordingly, the present study aims to characterize gross, fine and visual-motor skills in children with CDs, distinguishing children with CDs into three subgroups, i.e., with Language Disorders (LD), Speech Sound Disorders (SSD), and LD+SSD. In Experiment 1, around 60% of children with CDs (4 to 7 years; 21 with LD, 36 with SSD, and 90 with LD+SSD) showed clinical/borderline scores in balance skills, regardless of the type of communication deficit. However, children with LD, SSD, and LD+SSD did not differ in gross and fine motor skills. In Experiment 2, a higher percentage of children with CDs (4 to 7 years; 34 with LD, 62 with SSD, 148 with LD+SSD) obtained clinical/borderline scores in Visual Perception skills. Moreover, children with LD+SSD performed significantly worsen in Visual Perception and Fine Motor Coordination skills compared to children with SSD only. Our results underlined that CDs are generally associated with gross motor difficulties and that visual-motor difficulties are related to the type of communication deficit. Paying earlier attention to the motor skills of children with CDs could help clinicians design effective interventions.</p>

	<p>This study explored how working memory resources contributed to reading comprehension using tasks that focused on maintenance of verbal information in the phonological store, the interaction between the central executive and the phonological store (WMI), and the storage of bound semantic content in the episodic buffer (immediate narrative memory). We analysed how performance in these tasks was related to text decoding (reading speed and accuracy), listening and reading comprehension. The participants were 62 monolingual and 36 bilingual children (mean age nine years, SD = 9 months) enrolled in the same Italian primary school. Bilingual children were born to immigrant parents and had a long history of exposure to Italian as a second language. The regression analyses showed that reading accuracy and listening comprehension were associated with reading comprehension for monolingual and bilingual children. Two working memory components&amp;amp;mdash;WMI and immediate narrative memory&amp;amp;mdash;exhibited indirect effects on reading comprehension through reading accuracy and listening comprehension, respectively. Such effects occurred only for monolingual children. We discuss the implications of such findings for text reading and comprehension in monolinguals and bilinguals.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the brain activity of a group of people can be used to forecast choices at the population level. In this study, we attempted to neuroforecast aggregate consumer behavior of Internet users. During our electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking study, participants were exposed to 10 banners that were also used in the real digital marketing campaign. In the separate online study, we additionally collected self-reported preferences for the same banners. We explored the relationship between the EEG, eye-tracking, and behavioral indexes obtained in our studies and the banners&amp;amp;rsquo; aggregate efficiency provided by the large food retailer based on the decisions of 291,301 Internet users. An EEG-based engagement index (central beta/alpha ratio) significantly correlated with the aggregate efficiency of banners. Furthermore, our multiple linear regression models showed that a combination of eye-tracking, EEG and behavioral measurements better explained the market-level efficiency of banner advertisements than each measurement alone. Overall, our results confirm that neural signals of a relatively small number of individuals can forecast aggregate behavior at the population level.</p>

	<p>Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming more popular in the neurological rehabilitation field, and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is a type of brain oscillation rhythm that can be captured and analyzed in BCIs. Previous reviews have testified to the efficacy of the BCIs, but seldom have they discussed the motor task adopted in BCIs experiments in detail, as well as whether the feedback is suitable for them. We focused on the motor tasks adopted in SMR-based BCIs, as well as the corresponding feedback, and searched articles in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus and found 442 articles. After a series of screenings, 15 randomized controlled studies were eligible for analysis. We found motor imagery (MI) or motor attempt (MA) are common experimental paradigms in EEG-based BCIs trials. Imagining/attempting to grasp and extend the fingers is the most common, and there were multi-joint movements, including wrist, elbow, and shoulder. There were various types of feedback in MI or MA tasks for hand grasping and extension. Proprioception was used more frequently in a variety of forms. Orthosis, robot, exoskeleton, and functional electrical stimulation can assist the paretic limb movement, and visual feedback can be used as primary feedback or combined forms. However, during the recovery process, there are many bottleneck problems for hand recovery, such as flaccid paralysis or opening the fingers. In practice, we should mainly focus on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; difficulties, and design one or more motor tasks for patients, with the assistance of the robot, FES, or other combined feedback, to help them to complete a grasp, finger extension, thumb opposition, or other motion. Future research should focus on neurophysiological changes and functional improvements and further elaboration on the changes in neurophysiology during the recovery of motor function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of Retinogeniculate Synaptic Function in the DBA/2J Mouse Model of Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons comprise the optic nerve and carry information to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is then relayed to the cortex for conscious vision. Glaucoma is a blinding neurodegenerative disease that commonly results from intraocular pressure (IOP)-associated injury leading to RGC axonal pathology, disruption of RGC outputs to the brain, and eventual apoptotic loss of RGC somata. The consequences of elevated IOP and glaucomatous pathology on RGC signaling to the dLGN are largely unknown yet are likely to contribute to vision loss. Here, we used anatomic and physiological approaches to study the structure and function of retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in male and female DBA/2J (D2) mice with inherited glaucoma before and after IOP elevation. D2 mice showed progressive loss of anterograde optic tract transport to the dLGN and vGlut2 labeling of RGC axon terminals while patch-clamp measurements of RG synaptic function showed that synaptic transmission was reduced in 9-month and 12-month D2 mice because of the loss of individual RGC axon inputs. TC neuron dendrites had reduced Sholl complexity at 12 months, suggestive of delayed reorganization following reduced synaptic input. There was no detectable change in RGC density in 11- to 12-month D2 retinas, quantified as the number of ganglion cell layer-residing somata immuno-positive for NeuN and immuno-negative for the amacrine marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Thus, observed synaptic defects appear to precede RGC somatic loss. These findings identify glaucoma-associated and IOP-associated deficits in an important subcortical RGC projection target, shedding light on processes linking IOP to vision loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust and brain-like working memory through short-term synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Kozachkov, John Tauber, Mikael Lundqvist, Scott L. Brincat, Jean-Jacques Slotine, Earl K. Miller</p>

Working memory has long been thought to arise from sustained spiking/attractor dynamics. However, recent work has suggested that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may help maintain attractor states over gaps in time with little or no spiking. To determine if STSP endows additional functional advantages, we trained artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with and without STSP to perform an object working memory task. We found that RNNs with and without STSP were able to maintain memories despite distractors presented in the middle of the memory delay. However, RNNs with STSP showed activity that was similar to that seen in the cortex of a non-human primate (NHP) performing the same task. By contrast, RNNs without STSP showed activity that was less brain-like. Further, RNNs with STSP were more robust to network degradation than RNNs without STSP. These results show that STSP can not only help maintain working memories, it also makes neural networks more robust and brain-like.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian inference of multi-point macromolecular architecture mixtures at nanometre resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter A. Embacher, Tsvetelina E. Germanova, Emanuele Roscioli, Andrew D. McAinsh, Nigel J. Burroughs</p>

Gaussian spot fitting methods have significantly extended the spatial range where fluorescent microscopy can be used, with recent techniques approaching nanometre (nm) resolutions. However, small inter-fluorophore distances are systematically over-estimated for typical molecular scales. This bias can be corrected computationally, but current algorithms are limited to correcting distances between pairs of fluorophores. Here we present a flexible Bayesian computational approach that infers the distances and angles between multiple fluorophores and has several advantages over these previous methods. Specifically it improves confidence intervals for small lengths, estimates measurement errors of each fluorophore individually and infers the correlations between polygon lengths. The latter is essential for determining the full multi-fluorophore 3D architecture. We further developed the algorithm to infer the mixture composition of a heterogeneous population of multiple polygon states. We use our algorithm to analyse the 3D architecture of the human kinetochore, a macro-molecular complex that is essential for high fidelity chromosome segregation during cell division. Using triple fluorophore image data we unravel the mixture of kinetochore states during human mitosis, inferring the conformation of microtubule attached and unattached kinetochores and their proportions across mitosis. We demonstrate that the attachment conformation correlates with intersister tension and sister alignment to the metaphase plate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fine-scale diversity of microbial communities due to satellite niches in boom and bust environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yulia Fridman, Zihan Wang, Sergei Maslov, Akshit Goyal</p>

Recent observations have revealed that closely related strains of the same microbial species can stably coexist in natural and laboratory settings subject to boom and bust dynamics and serial dilutions, respectively. However, the possible mechanisms enabling the coexistence of only a handful of strains, but not more, have thus far remained unknown. Here, using a consumer-resource model of microbial ecosystems, we propose that by differentiating along Monod parameters characterizing microbial growth rates in high and low nutrient conditions, strains can coexist in patterns similar to those observed. In our model, boom and bust environments create satellite niches due to resource concentrations varying in time. These satellite niches can be occupied by closely related strains, thereby enabling their coexistence. We demonstrate that this result is valid even in complex environments consisting of multiple resources and species. In these complex communities, each species partitions resources differently and creates separate sets of satellite niches for their own strains. While there is no theoretical limit to the number of coexisting strains, in our simulations, we always find between 1 and 3 strains coexisting, consistent with known experiments and observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic causal modelling shows a prominent role of local inhibition in alpha power modulation in higher visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frederik Van de Steen, Dimitris Pinotsis, Wouter Devos, Nigel Colenbier, Iege Bassez, Karl Friston, Daniele Marinazzo</p>

During resting-state EEG recordings, alpha activity is more prominent over the posterior cortex in eyes-closed (EC) conditions compared to eyes-open (EO). In this study, we characterized the difference in spectra between EO and EC conditions using dynamic causal modelling. Specifically, we investigated the role of intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity—within the visual cortex—in generating EC-EO alpha power differences over posterior electrodes. The primary visual cortex (V1) and the bilateral middle temporal visual areas (V5) were equipped with bidirectional extrinsic connections using a canonical microcircuit. The states of four intrinsically coupled subpopulations—within each occipital source—were also modelled. Using Bayesian model selection, we tested whether modulations of the intrinsic connections in V1, V5 or extrinsic connections (or a combination thereof) provided the best evidence for the data. In addition, using parametric empirical Bayes (PEB), we estimated group averages under the winning model. Bayesian model selection showed that the winning model contained both extrinsic connectivity modulations, as well as intrinsic connectivity modulations in all sources. The PEB analysis revealed increased extrinsic connectivity during EC. Overall, we found a reduction in the inhibitory intrinsic connections during EC. The results suggest that the intrinsic modulations in V5 played the most important role in producing EC-EO alpha differences, suggesting an intrinsic disinhibition in higher order visual cortex, during EC resting state.

                <p>by John S. Park, Eric Post</p>

Phenology refers to the seasonal timing patterns commonly exhibited by life on Earth, from blooming flowers to breeding birds to human agriculture. Climate change is altering abiotic seasonality (e.g., longer summers) and in turn, phenological patterns contained within. However, how phenology should evolve is still an unsolved problem. This problem lies at the crux of predicting future phenological changes that will likely have substantial ecosystem consequences, and more fundamentally, of understanding an undeniably global phenomenon. Most studies have associated proximate environmental variables with phenological responses in case-specific ways, making it difficult to contextualize observations within a general evolutionary framework. We outline the complex but universal ways in which seasonal timing maps onto evolutionary fitness. We borrow lessons from life history theory and evolutionary demography that have benefited from a first principles-based theoretical scaffold. Lastly, we identify key questions for theorists and empiricists to help advance our general understanding of phenology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The RNA export and RNA decay complexes THO and TRAMP prevent transcription-replication conflicts, DNA breaks, and CAG repeat contractions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca E. Brown, Xiaofeng A. Su, Stacey Fair, Katherine Wu, Lauren Verra, Robyn Jong, Kristin Andrykovich, Catherine H. Freudenreich</p>

Expansion of structure-forming CAG/CTG repetitive sequences is the cause of several neurodegenerative disorders and deletion of repeats is a potential therapeutic strategy. Transcription-associated mechanisms are known to cause CAG repeat instability. In this study, we discovered that Thp2, an RNA export factor and member of the THO (suppressors of transcriptional defects of <i>h</i><i>pr1Δ</i> by overexpression) complex, and Trf4, a key component of the TRAMP (Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation) complex involved in nuclear RNA polyadenylation and degradation, are necessary to prevent CAG fragility and repeat contractions in a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> model system. Depletion of both Thp2 and Trf4 proteins causes a highly synergistic increase in CAG repeat fragility, indicating a complementary role of the THO and TRAMP complexes in preventing genome instability. Loss of either Thp2 or Trf4 causes an increase in RNA polymerase stalling at the CAG repeats and other genomic loci, as well as genome-wide transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), implicating TRCs as a cause of CAG fragility and instability in their absence. Analysis of the effect of RNase H1 overexpression on CAG fragility, RNAPII stalling, and TRCs suggests that RNAPII stalling with associated R-loops are the main cause of CAG fragility in the <i>thp2Δ</i> mutants. In contrast, CAG fragility and TRCs in the <i>trf4Δ</i> mutant can be compensated for by RPA overexpression, suggesting that excess unprocessed RNA in TRAMP4 mutants leads to reduced RPA availability and high levels of TRCs. Our results show the importance of RNA surveillance pathways in preventing RNAPII stalling, TRCs, and DNA breaks, and show that RNA export and RNA decay factors work collaboratively to maintain genome stability.

                Uma Naresh et al. show that the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is required for growth and germline proliferation after prolonged starvation. Mitochondrial localization of the bZIP protein ATFS-1 promotes mtDNA replication and is required to re-establish or regenerate the mitochondrial network depleted by autophagy.

                Tilsed et al. characterize the tumor microenvironment associated with response to cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. They find that a CD4 T cell associated inflammatory IFN/TNF-α gene signature is associated with response in a murine mesothelioma model and patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, chemotherapy efficacy can be improved by pre-treating tumors with targeted immunotherapy.

                Controlling neuroinflammation in neurotrauma is an important but unachieved goal. Rehman et al. exploit a moderate TBI model and array-based proteomics to identify Met/HGFR as an inducer of reactive microglia. A small-molecule inhibitor of Met/HGFR suppresses microglial reactivity, reduces neuronal and vascular alterations, limits behavioral disturbances, and accelerates recovery.
