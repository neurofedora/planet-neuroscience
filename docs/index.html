                Background Peer tutoring, a pedagogical approach in which students assist one another in the learning process, has demonstrated strong educational and psychosocial benefits in health professions education. It enhances cognitive development, communication, self-efficacy, and social connectedness. Within nursing education, peer tutoring encourages reflective learning and professional growth. However, limited research has explored its impact within culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Aims This study explored the experiences of nursing student tutors and tutees at the University of Sharjah, evaluating their impact on academic development, emotional resilience, interpersonal connections, and the overall learning experience within a culturally and linguistically diverse population. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with a purposive sampling of 20 undergraduate nursing students (6tutors and12 tutees) at the University of Sharjah. Data were analyzed inductively through thematic content analysis following the COREQ guidelines. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) Tutors’ perspectives and experiences, (2) Tutees’ perspectives and experiences, and (3) Barriers to peer tutoring. Peer tutoring was found to enhance academic comprehension, communication, and confidence, while also fostering collaboration and empathy. Challenges included language barriers, inconsistent commitment, and limited time for relationship building Conclusions Peer tutoring represents an effective, student-centered learning strategy that supports academic success, promotes psychological safety, and nurtures professional competencies among nursing students. Findings underscore the need for structured, institutionally supported peer tutoring programs that address linguistic diversity, ensure tutor preparation, and integrate emotional and cultural sensitivity into nursing curricula.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1129/v2?src=rss">Integration of Breaking and Computational Physics: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Contextualized Teaching [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study presents an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach aimed at contextualizing the teaching of classical mechanics through the computational analysis of breaking movements. Situated within a constructivist framework, the research explores how culturally embedded practices—specifically urban dance—can serve as a medium for fostering conceptual understanding of physics in non-formal educational settings. By leveraging the artistic and kinesthetic dimensions of breaking, the study seeks to bridge the gap between abstract scientific content and learners’ lived experiences. Method A mixed-method, exploratory design was employed with a purposive sample of ten dancers (aged 13–30) affiliated with a community-based urban dance school in Bogotá, Colombia. Over the course of six three-hour sessions, participants engaged in movement analysis using Tracker video software, supported by pre- and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. The research design incorporated thematic analysis to interpret qualitative data, complemented by the kinematic study of body movement parameters such as angular velocity and center of mass. Results Findings indicate a marked cognitive shift among participants from intuitive and superficial conceptions to a more technical and applied understanding of physics principles. The integration of computational tools allowed dancers to visualize and internalize biomechanical variables relevant to their performance. Participants reported enhanced bodily control, injury prevention, and aesthetic execution, alongside increased motivation and collaborative learning. Conclusions The study concludes that embedding scientific content within culturally relevant, embodied practices—mediated by educational technologies—can significantly enhance learning outcomes in physics. The use of Tracker software not only demystified abstract concepts but also redefined physics as accessible and contextually meaningful. These results underscore the pedagogical potential of transdisciplinary, arts-integrated methodologies to foster inclusive, situated, and cognitively rich science education in non-traditional environments.

                arXiv:2602.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks trained to predict observable dynamics can be used to decompose the temporal activity of complex heterogeneous systems into simple, interpretable representations. Here we apply this framework to simulated neural assemblies with thousands of neurons and demonstrate that it can jointly reveal the connectivity matrix, the neuron types, the signaling functions, and in some cases hidden external stimuli. In contrast to existing machine learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks and transformers, which emphasize predictive accuracy but offer limited interpretability, our method provides both reliable forecasts of neural activity and interpretable decomposition of the mechanisms governing large neural assemblies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13368">The Influence of Width Ratios on Structural Beauty in Male Faces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between interocular distance relative to overall facial width (width ratio) and perceived subjective beauty in male faces. Building on the methodology of Pallett et al. (2010), who found that average proportions in female faces were rated as most attractive, the current study aimed to test this hypothesis in male faces. Faces from the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al., 2015) were morphed into average faces within three groups (with low, medium, and high width ratios), each composed of 96 or 97 individual images. These three average faces were then systematically manipulated in their width ratios across three levels in both directions, respectively, resulting in a total of 21 comparable faces. The use of multiple base faces served as a control for potential artifacts of image processing. Consequently, comparisons were restricted to within-group pairs to avoid confounding by co-varying facial features (e.g., skin tone), which precluded direct cross-condition comparisons but ensured internal validity. In a two-alternative forced-choice task, participants selected the more beautiful face from each pair. The data were analyzed using a Bayesian model which enables inference of the width ratio perceived as most beautiful. Results support the hypothesis that averageness in facial proportions correlates with higher perceived attractiveness. The study highlights the importance of controlling for image manipulation, including attempts at methodological implementation, and of considering ethnicity as a potential moderating variable. These findings offer a data-driven foundation for understanding facial aesthetics and cognitive processes of human perception, with applications in advertising, artificial face generation, and plastic surgery.

                arXiv:2602.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social entities only exist in virtue of collective acceptance or recognition, or acknowledgement by two or more individuals in the context of joint activities. Joint activities are made possible by the coordination of plans for action, and the coordination of plans for action is made possible by the capacity for collective intentionality. This paper investigates how primitive is the capacity that nonhuman animals have to create social entities, by individuating how primitive is the capacity for collective intentionality. I present a novel argument for the evolutionary primitiveness of social entities, by showing that the collective intentions upon which these social entities are created and shared are metaphysically reducible to the relevant individual intentions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13421">Metabolic cost of information processing in Poisson variational autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $\beta$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $\beta$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.

                arXiv:2602.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously investigated color constancy in photorealistic virtual reality (VR) and developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that predicts reflectance from rendered images. Here, we combine both approaches to compare and study a model and human performance with respect to established color constancy mechanisms: local surround, maximum flux and spatial mean. Rather than evaluating the model against physical ground truth, model performance was assessed using the same achromatic object selection task employed in the human experiments. The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance. We then applied transfer learning, fine-tuning only the network's decoder on images from the baseline VR condition. To parallel the human experiment, the model's output was used to perform the same achromatic object selection task across all conditions. Results show a strong correspondence between the model and human behavior. Both achieved high constancy under baseline conditions and showed similar, condition-dependent performance declines when the local surround or spatial mean color cues were removed.

                arXiv:2602.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a theoretical framework for understanding computation in biological neural circuits, yet classical results, such as Hopfield's model of associative memory, rely on symmetric connectivity that restricts network dynamics to gradient-like flows. In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09045">Coevolutionary balance of resting-state brain networks in autism</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.09045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with atypical large-scale brain organization, yet the functional principles underlying these alterations remain incompletely understood. We examined whether coevolutionary balance, a network-level energy measure derived from signed interactions and nodal activity states, captures disruptions in resting-state functional connectivity in autistic adults. Using resting-state fMRI data from ABIDE I with ComBat harmonization to mitigate multi-site batch effects, we constructed whole-brain networks by combining binarized fALFF activity with signed functional correlations and quantified their coevolutionary energy. In the primary analysis with global signal regression (GSR), the ASD group showed significantly more negative global coevolutionary energy (pFDR < 0.002), higher proportions of agreement links, and lower proportions of imbalanced-same links, indicating a systematic redistribution of local motifs rather than a uniform increase in balance. Because GSR can introduce artifactual negative correlations, we repeated all analyses without GSR. In this sensitivity analysis, whole-brain energy and motif differences were attenuated, but bipolarity, a measure of global two-block signed network organization, became the only FDR-significant metric (pFDR = 0.047), with ASD showing higher bipolarity. Intra-network energy differences did not survive FDR correction under either pipeline. Coevolutionary energy showed modest associations with ADI-R and ADOS scores, none of which survived correction across 720 tests. Machine learning classification achieved 77.8% test accuracy (AUC = 0.79) with GSR and 64.7% (AUC = 0.65) without GSR. These findings suggest that coevolutionary balance captures altered signed network organization in ASD, though the specific metric driving group differences depends on preprocessing choices regarding global signal regression.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983">Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

Abstract: High-dimensional chaotic dynamics can emerge in a large random recurrent neural network when the synaptic gain crosses a threshold. Recent works showed that the kinetic energy of neural activity links the chaotic dynamics and the supporting unstable fixed points (equilibria) in the phase space. Here, we investigate the kinetic-energy-centric properties of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain) and exhibits a cubic scaling behavior near the critical point from above. This scaling behavior is supported by numerical simulations and provides a quantitative characterization of how fast the dynamics change during the onset of chaos. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems from the kinetic-energy optimization perspective as well. The activity distribution is also analyzed in a geometric angle, establishing a relationship between the original chaotic dynamics and the gradient dynamics of the kinetic energy. The trajectory length on the chaotic manifold can be derived from the stationary kinetic energy, and the associated stationary behavior is analyzed as well. This study provides a kinetic-energy-centric route toward understanding the dynamics landscape of recurrent neural networks, which may provide insights for reservoir computing and even for internal synaptic learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903">Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.

                arXiv:2602.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), biological neuronal networks solve complex cognitive tasks with sparse neuronal activity, recurrent connections, and local learning rules. These mechanisms serve as design principles in Neuromorphic computing, which addresses the critical challenge of energy consumption in modern computing. However, most mixed-signal neuromorphic devices rely on semi- or unsupervised learning rules, which are ineffective for optimizing hardware in supervised learning tasks. This lack of scalable solutions for on-chip learning restricts the potential of mixed-signal devices to enable sustainable, intelligent edge systems. To address these challenges, we present a novel learning algorithm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal devices that integrates spike-based weight updates with feedback control signals. In our framework, a spiking controller generates feedback signals to guide SNN activity and drive weight updates, enabling scalable and local on-chip learning. We first evaluate the algorithm on various classification tasks, demonstrating that single-layer SNNs trained with feedback control achieve performance comparable to artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then assess its implementation on mixed-signal neuromorphic devices by testing network performance in continuous online learning scenarios and evaluating resilience to hyperparameter mismatches. Our results show that the feedback control optimizer is compatible with neuromorphic applications, advancing the potential for scalable, on-chip learning solutions in edge applications.

                arXiv:2602.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address multi-objective unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement for motorway intelligent transportation systems, where deployments must balance coverage, link quality, and UAV count under geometric constraints. We construct a reproducible benchmark from highD motorway recordings with recording-level splits and generate Pareto-optimal labels via NSGA-II. A preference rule yields deployable targets while preserving multi-objective evaluation. We train fast surrogate models that map unordered vehicle positions to UAV count and continuous placements, using permutation-aware losses and constraint-regularized training across set-based and sequence-based architectures. The evaluation protocol combines Pareto quality metrics, success-rate curves, runtime benchmarks, and robustness studies, with uncertainty quantified by recording-level bootstrap. Results indicate that permutation-invariant set models provide the strongest coverage--SNR--count trade-off among learned predictors and approach NSGA-II quality while enabling real-time inference. Under shared budgets, they offer a more favorable success--latency trade-off than heuristic baselines. The benchmark, splits are released to support reproducible ITS deployment studies and to facilitate comparisons under shared operational budgets.

                arXiv:2602.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms aim to discover diverse, high-performing solutions across behavioral niches. However, QD search often stagnates as incremental variation operators struggle to propagate building blocks across large populations. Existing mutation operators rely on gradual variation to solutions, limiting their ability to efficiently explore regions of the search space distant from parent solutions or to spread beneficial genetic material through the population. We propose a mutation operator which augments variation-based operators with discrete, gene-level crossover, enabling rapid recombination of elite genetic material. This crossover mechanism mirrors the biological principle of meiosis and facilitates both the direct transfer of genetic material and the exploration of novel genotype configurations beyond the existing elite hypervolume. We evaluate operators on three locomotion environments, demonstrating improvements in QD score, coverage, and max fitness, with particularly strong performance in later stages of optimization once building blocks have been established in the archive. These results show that the addition of a discrete crossover mutation provides a complementary exploration mechanism that sustains quality-diversity growth beyond the performance demonstrated by existing operators.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks present a novel approach in SciML that integrates physical laws in the form of partial differential equations directly into the NN through soft constraints in the loss function. This work studies the application of PINNs to solve a one dimensional coupled electro-elastodynamic system modeling linear piezoelectricity in stress-charge form, governed by elastodynamic and electrodynamic equations. Our simulation employs a feedforward architecture, mapping space-time coordinates to mechanical displacement and electric potential. Our PINN model achieved global relative L2 errors of 2.34 and 4.87 percent for displacement and electric potential respectively. The results validate PINNs as effective mesh free solvers for coupled time-dependent PDE systems, though challenges remain regarding error accumulation and stiffness in coupled eigenvalue systems.

                arXiv:2602.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in the presence of missing data can result in biased predictions and poor generalizability, among other difficulties, which data imputation methods only partially address. In neural networks, activation functions significantly affect performance yet typical options (e.g., ReLU, Swish) operate only on feature values and do not account for missingness indicators or confidence scores. We propose Three-Channel Evolved Activations (3C-EA), which we evolve using Genetic Programming to produce multivariate activation functions f(x, m, c) in the form of trees that take (i) the feature value x, (ii) a missingness indicator m, and (iii) an imputation confidence score c. To make these activations useful beyond the input layer, we introduce ChannelProp, an algorithm that deterministically propagates missingness and confidence values via linear layers based on weight magnitudes, retaining reliability signals throughout the network. We evaluate 3C-EA and ChannelProp on datasets with natural and injected (MCAR/MAR/MNAR) missingness at multiple rates under identical preprocessing and splits. Results indicate that integrating missingness and confidence inputs into the activation search improves classification performance under missingness.

Abstract: Landauer's principle bounds the heat generated by logical operations, but in practice the thermodynamic cost of computation is dominated by the control systems that implement logic. CMOS gates dissipate energy far above the Landauer bound, while laboratory demonstrations of near-Landauer erasure rely on external measurement or feedback systems whose energy costs exceed that of the logic operation by many orders of magnitude. Here we use simulations to show that a genetic algorithm can program a thermodynamic computer to implement logic operations in which the total heat emitted by the control system is of a similar order of magnitude to that of the information-bearing degrees of freedom. Moreover, the computer can be programmed so that heat is drawn away from the information-bearing degrees of freedom and dissipated within the control unit, suggesting the possibility of computing architectures in which heat management is an integral part of the program design.

                arXiv:2602.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery. OR-Agent source code and experiments data are publicly available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/OR-Agent.

                arXiv:2602.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14445">Selective Synchronization Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14490">Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Mixture of Space Experts</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.

                arXiv:2602.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.

                arXiv:2602.11398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary search is well suited for large-scale biophysical brain modeling, where many parameters with nonlinear interactions and no tractable gradients need to be optimized. Standard evolutionary approaches achieve an excellent fit to MRI data; however, among many possible such solutions, it finds ones that overfit to individual subjects and provide limited predictive power. This paper investigates whether guiding evolution with biological knowledge can help. Focusing on whole-brain Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) models, a baseline where 20 parameters were shared across the brain was compared against a heterogeneous formulation where different sets of 20 parameters were used for the seven canonical brain regions. The heterogeneous model was optimized using four strategies: optimizing all parameters at once, a curricular approach following the hierarchy of brain networks (HICO), a reversed curricular approach, and a randomly shuffled curricular approach. While all heterogeneous strategies fit the data well, only curricular approaches generalized to new subjects. Most importantly, only HICO made it possible to use the parameter sets to predict the subjects' behavioral abilities as well. Thus, by guiding evolution with biological knowledge about the hierarchy of brain regions, HICO demonstrated how domain knowledge can be harnessed to serve the purpose of optimization in real-world domains.

Abstract: In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider two regression tasks, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we demonstrated improvement of the validation mean squared error loss. Moreover, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness by numerically simulating quantum neural network training on a realistic model of a noisy superconducting quantum computer.

                arXiv:2506.08749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4\% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

                arXiv:2506.17040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering which feature combinations are encoded by visual units is critical to understanding how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is critical to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), a model-agnostic, gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's maximally invariant stimuli, and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter (stretch) the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation downstream (squeeze). To probe adversarial sensitivity, stretching and squeezing are reversed to maximally perturb unit activation while minimizing changes to the upstream representation. Applied to CNNs, SnS revealed invariant transformations that were farther from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed depending on the stage of the image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer representations mainly altered texture and pose. By measuring how well the hierarchical invariant images obtained for L2 robust networks were classified by humans and other observer networks, we discovered a substantial drop in their interpretability when the representation was stretched in deep layers, while the opposite trend was found for standard models.

                arXiv:2508.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.

                arXiv:2512.15829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

                arXiv:2602.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108268">Kinematics and morphological correlates of descent strategies in arboreal mammals suggest early upright postures in euprimates</a></h4>

              
                Ascending and descending sloping and vertical branches are critical for arboreal locomotion and likely played a major role in early primate evolution. While most studies have focused on ascent, descending behaviors also provide insight into the functional significance of arboreal adaptations. To test how descending vertical supports of varying diameters affect locomotor abilities, we quantified postural and kinematic features during descents and ascents on vertical supports in 21 eutherian and metatherian mammals and examined their relation to morphology. Primates showed greater variability in descent behaviors, using tail-first and side postures more often than other mammals, which predominantly descended head-first. Overall, animals adopted several kinematic adjustments to enhance stability during descent compared to ascent, including slower speeds, higher duty factors, and greater use of asymmetrical gaits. Additionally, vertical descent strategies reflected trade-offs among body mass, limb proportions, and head mass. Using a morphology-based model, we then inferred possible descent behaviors in 13 extinct euarchontoglires. Our results suggest that ancestral adaptations for vertical locomotion may have promoted frequent upright (head-up) postures in early primates.

">The Interplay between Language Development, Short-Term Memory, and Auditory Associative Word Learning in Younger and Older Children</a></h4>

              
                Auditory associative word learning has been shown in infants and proven to be a difficult task in young adults, where learning is only successful under specific conditions. In order to better understand the transition from successful infant auditory associative word learning to the challenging adult learning, we tested 5-6-year-olds and 9-10-year-olds in a sequential associative task to investigate their ability in associating novel pseudowords with environmental sounds. Additionally, we explored short-term episodic recognition memory, language development, sex, and musical training and their effects on behavioral and electrophysiological measures of word learning. EEG data were collected to assess word learning in an initial training phase (consistent vs. inconsistent pairings) and a subsequent testing phase (matching vs. violated pairings) with additional button-press reactions for behavioral learning data. While learning effects were seen in the first half of the training phase in younger children, no early effects of learning were found in older children. Only musically trained 9-10-year-olds indicated word learning in the second half of the training phase. In the testing phase, only non-musically trained 9-10-year-olds revealed trend-level N400-like responses. Short-term memory (auditory-verbal, auditory-nonverbal, and visual-nonverbal) and language development improved with age, but only visual-nonverbal short-term recognition memory was positively correlated with improved auditory associative word learning. Unlike cross-modal visual associative word learning, our results, together with earlier findings in infants and young adults, suggest a difficulty in auditory associative word learning beyond infancy, which is sustained from childhood to young adulthood.

">Transsynaptic neural circuit mapping of ventral hippocampus motivational control systems</a></h4>

              
                The ventral hippocampus contributes to food intake regulation and a range of motivational and memory processes, and its dysfunction is associated with several cognitive and behavioral disorders. However, its circuit-level organization remains incompletely understood. Ventral CA1 (CA1v) neurons send projections to several regions involved in motivational control. Here we focus on three major forebrain targets: the nucleus accumbens shell (ACBsh), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). We mapped the upstream and downstream circuitry of CA1v neurons defined by their projections to these target regions in rats using complementary transsynaptic anterograde and retrograde viral tracing approaches. Monosynaptic outputs to ACBsh, mPFC, and LHA were targeted using ATLAS, a novel transsynaptic anterograde viral approach that drives Cre recombinase in neurons receiving glutamatergic synaptic transmission from the CA1v. Second-order projections arising from these defined pathways were then mapped using a Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing strategy. In parallel, upstream inputs to CA1v neurons projecting to each downstream target were mapped using a conditional retrograde glycoprotein-deleted rabies viral approach. Anterograde tracing revealed both shared and pathway-specific second-order targets, including bidirectional CA1v projections. Retrograde tracing confirmed expected inputs (e.g., CA3) and uncovered previously unrecognized cortical sources that differed across downstream projection-defined CA1v subpopulations. Together, these findings delineate pathway-specific, multinode circuits linking CA1v neurons to key motivational systems that may inform future therapeutic strategies for disorders involving ventral hippocampal dysfunction.

                Background Physical literacy, encompassing motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and behavior, is increasingly recognized as a central outcome of physical education. Problem-based learning (PBL) and digital fitness applications have been proposed as student-centered approaches to support physical literacy development. However, evidence remains limited regarding whether the effectiveness of technology-integrated PBL varies according to learners’ non-cognitive characteristics, particularly grit. Methods This study employed a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design to examine the effects of fitness-app-integrated problem-based learning and student grit level on physical literacy outcomes. Participants were 64 Grade XI vocational secondary school students in Indonesia who were assigned to either PBL with fitness application support or PBL without application support. Students were categorized into high- and low-grit groups based on a validated physical education–specific grit scale. Physical literacy was assessed using an adapted Indonesian version of the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy, Second Edition (CAPL-2). Post-intervention data were analysed using two-way analysis of variance. Results A significant interaction was found between instructional model and grit level. Students with lower grit demonstrated significantly higher physical literacy scores in the app-supported PBL condition compared with the non-app condition. In contrast, students with higher grit showed comparable physical literacy outcomes across instructional models. No significant overall main effect of instructional model was observed. Conclusions The findings indicate that fitness application integration within problem-based learning may provide compensatory support for students with lower grit, while offering limited additional benefit for students with higher grit. These results highlight the importance of aligning technology use with learner characteristics when designing instructional approaches to support physical literacy in vocational physical education.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus, a key neural structure supporting episodic memory, comprises distinct subfields including the dentate gyrus (DG), Cornu Ammonis (CA1–3), and subiculum. Hippocampal subfields typically show age-related volumetric decline across adulthood, but the regional aging may be differentially vulnerable to cardiovascular risk factors. Here, we examined the association between hippocampal subfield volumes and cardiovascular risk indices—hypertension, blood pressure variation (BPV), body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio—in groups of younger (<i>n</i> = 37, ages 18–29 years) and older adults (<i>n</i> = 22, ages 60–79 years). The findings revealed a specific link between cardiovascular health and hippocampal subfield volumes, with the subiculum showing greater sensitivity. Among younger adults, hypertension predicted smaller subiculum, while higher BMI correlated with larger CA1–2 volumes. For older adults, higher BPV predicted smaller subiculum volume, independent of hypertension that correlated with larger regional volume. Age moderated the relation between all indices and subiculum volume except waist-to-hip ratio. These findings highlight age-dependent, subfield-specific risk factors for hippocampal aging and underscore the potential for identifying sensitive periods for both risk and protection against late-life cognitive decline.</p>

                Background We explored the factors that influence the adoption of e-commerce and its link to digital purchasing decisions in indigenous Amazonian communities in Peru. Method A quantitative approach was applied, with a non-experimental design and explanatory scope, based on 301 people aged 18 to 35, residents of Bagua. Surveys were used to evaluate dimensions such as performance expectations, effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, means of payment, available technology, and product variety. Results The findings revealed low adoption of e-commerce associated with structural and sociocultural barriers, including lack of connectivity, limited technological knowledge, and limited training opportunities. Social influence and perceived usefulness were identified as key elements in promoting the use of digital platforms. Conclusion A significant association was found between technological access, product variety, and the decision to purchase digitally, suggesting the need for contextualised strategies that respect cultural identity and enhance local capacities as a way to promote a sustainable and inclusive digital transition in indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-277/v1?src=rss">Strategic Decisions and the Entrepreneurial Mindset in Sustaining Agribusiness SMEs in Emerging Economies: Unlocking Pathways to Resilience – A Narrative Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This narrative review examines how strategic decisions shaped by the entrepreneurial mindset sustain agribusiness SMEs in emerging economies, highlighting pathways to resilience. Recognising a critical knowledge gap in understanding the cognitive mechanisms that drive SME sustainability, the review is anchored in Entrepreneurial Cognition Theory and the Triple Bottom Line framework. The study synthesises empirical evidence from 2020 to 2025 using a qualitative research design with systematic data collection from peer-reviewed journals and grey literature. Findings indicate that entrepreneurial cognition guides strategic resource allocation, innovation adoption, market positioning, risk management, and the integration of social and environmental sustainability, collectively enhancing economic, social, and ecological resilience. Persistent challenges include structural constraints, unequal access to finance and technology, gender disparities, and sustainability trade-offs in niche markets. Policy and practical implications emphasise cooperative models, targeted innovation financing, market intelligence support, and incentives for sustainability-aligned practices. The review contributes empirically by consolidating evidence across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, offering comparative insights into how SMEs navigate complex and resource-constrained environments. Theoretically, it extends the application of Entrepreneurial Cognition Theory and the Triple Bottom Line framework to context-specific decision-making in agribusiness SMEs, demonstrating how cognitive processes underpin sustainable strategic actions. By linking entrepreneurial decision-making to resilience outcomes, the review provides actionable insights for policymakers, development partners, and SME owner-managers seeking to enhance competitiveness, long-term viability, and inclusive growth in emerging economies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70081?af=R">Spatial Organization of Morpho‐Electric Subtypes of Pyramidal Neuron in the Subiculum</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The subiculum is a main output structure of the hippocampus, transmitting information from the CA1 to the entorhinal cortex in a spatially structured manner. Prior studies revealed a high electrophysiological and molecular heterogeneity of subicular pyramidal neurons (PYNs) with evidence for further spatial subdivisions of the subiculum. In this study we focused on the cellular organization of the proximal to mid-distal part of the subiculum, designated as subregion 2 (Sub2) and performed a comprehensive electrophysiological and morphological characterization of PYNs by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings combined with intracellular labeling in acute rat hippocampal brain slices. Principal component analysis based on discharge pattern-related parameters and subsequent unsupervised, hierarchical clustering classified the PYNs into three subtypes: regular firing (RF), weak-bursting (WB), and strong-bursting (SB) neurons. Electrophysiological analysis revealed further differences between RF neurons and the two subtypes of bursting neurons in their active and passive properties. The three subtypes also showed differences in their morphometric features, including the apical and basal dendritic spread and branching pattern. Additionally, we identified a divergent morphological subset among RF neurons, bearing two apical dendrites. Mapping the three PYN subtypes onto the subiculum revealed specific spatial distributions along the superficial-deep and proximo-distal axes. Thus, this work maps the heterogeneity of subicular PYN onto differentially distributed subclasses in the Sub2 region with distinct physiological and morphological features. These findings together with prior observations of divergent anatomical projections from subicular subregions are pivotal for the understanding of how subicular morpho-electric neuron types relate to each other and contribute to processing and distribution of information to cortical regions from this hippocampal output region.</p>

                Background Gypseous soil exhibits significant collapsibility when saturated due to the dissolution of gypsum bonds, resulting in substantial reductions in shear strength and settlement problems. Understanding the influence of pile morphology on shaft resistance under these conditions is essential for constructing foundations in collapsible soils. The load-settlement behavior of the pile foundation can be established through an empirical pile loading test after preparing the soil and installing the piles in the model. Methods A physical model measuring 37×80×80 cm was constructed to assess the performance of three aluminum floating piles (square, circular, and rectangular) with identical cross-sectional areas, embedded in loose gypseous soil containing 58% gypsum and exhibiting a relative density of 30%. Pile load experiments with a constant rate of penetration (1 mm/min) were conducted under both dry and saturated conditions. Twelve methods were employed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity, including Davisson, De Beer, Brinch Hansen's 80% and 90%, Chin-Kondner, Decourt, and ASTM D-1143. Results Soaking caused a significant decrease in capacity; the ultimate load dropped by approximately 45-55% for the square pile, 55-60% for the rectangular pile, and 60-65% for the circular pile, depending on the interpretation method used. The Chin-Kondner method is notable among interpretation methods, providing the most consistent and accurate estimates of ultimate capacity in both dry and saturated conditions, with the lowest variability across shapes (coefficient of variability < 10%). Conclusions The shape of piles significantly influences load transfer in gypseous soils, especially when saturated. Square piles offer greater reliability and are less prone to strength loss due to collapse. In collapsible gypseous soils with high gypsum content, using square sections and Chin-Kondner interpretation is recommended for more accurate pile foundation design. Davisson's method provided the most conservative estimate of pile capacity among the twelve methods, particularly when saturated.

                Background As the financial markets are becoming increasingly complicated, there is a need to understand the evolving market microstructure landscape. While the existing research is well-focused on quantitative aspects of financial markets, qualitative aspects remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to explore the market microstructure of cryptocurrencies through a mixed-methodological approach. Methods By leveraging podcast analysis as primary data source, the study aims to uncover core thematic dimensions through techniques of lexicometry using Iramuteq. A total of 12 domain-specific podcasts are analyzed and processed in the study for descending hierarchical classification, resulting in five lexical clusters. These clusters are then subjected to factorial analysis using the Scikit-learn library in Python (v3.10). Results The descending hierarchical classification reveals five thematic clusters reflecting institutional infrastructure, market foundation, efficiency and resilience, forecasting and modelling dynamics, and market structure and efficiency. Followed by this, the factorial analysis discloses three dominant factors; market structure, forecasting models, and resilience mechanisms that shape the understanding of cryptocurrency market microstructure. The findings indicate that discussions on market microstructure of cryptocurrencies are multidimensional and are closely linked with both technological and regulatory developments. Conclusion The study contributes to literature by introducing a novel data source for qualitative finance research. The use of podcasts enhances the depth of extracted themes. Practitioners and academicians can gain updated insights on evolving market microstructure mechanisms for digital financial markets. The originality of this study lies in its unique approach, bridging top industry expert insights with quantitative techniques to offer a deeper understanding and future direction in market microstructure of cryptocurrencies.

                Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal, metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age. It can be induced by genetic, immunological, and environmental determinants. The main pathophysiology of PCOS, is hyperandrogenism, which can lead to acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, as well as infertility. However, PCOS is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. There was little study on the autoimmunity, like anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies, of PCOS, so the current study was designed to test the effectiveness of these antibodies on the occurrence of PCOS. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the role of, (anti-FSH, and anti-LH antibodies, in PCOS occurrence). Methods About 65 patients with PCOS, and 56 healthy women (controls) were recruited. Their ages were 20-45 years. Body mass index (BMI) was computed as, (weight) divided by (height squared, (kg/m2). Blood samples were obtained randomly from the Medical City Hospital in Baghdad and private infertility clinics. This study was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. The levels of anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results The results revealed a non-significant increase in anti-FSH antibody in patients (36.22±6.73) ng/ml, compared to controls (34.99±9.78 ng/ml), and a highly significant decrease in anti-LH antibody in patients (45.29±3.04 ng/ml), as compared to controls (69.16±10.90 ng/ml), (p<0.05). The fertility hormone, FSH showed a non-significant increase in unhealthy women (8.12±0.74 mIU/ml), in contrast to healthy women (7.35±0.62 mIU/ml) (p>0.05). While the LH hormone results was, in patients with PCOS (7.61±0.73 mIU/ml), as opposed to the control group, which was (5.62±0.56 mIU/ml), the (p>0.05). Finally, the LH/FSH ratio showed a non-significant increase in both patients (1.161±0.37) and controls (0.7819±0.22) (p>0.05). Conclusion Women with PCOS showed increased LH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. However, a decrease in anti-LH antibody was accompanied by an increase of LH hormone and LH/FSH ratio.

                The research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical frameworks that define the nature of the relationship between cryptocurrencies and their volatility with the performance of financial market indices. It also aims to explain and analyze the mechanism of this potential influence on a sample of US financial markets for the period (2020-2024), by adopting the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology introduced by (Pesaran et al., 2009) The research assessment results revealed the positive impact of Bitcoin and Tether on the performance of all US stock market indices, perhaps indicating that they act as an investment asset that supports financial market growth, especially in the long term. This suggests the possibility of considering Bitcoin and Tether as a guiding indicator for the performance of investment portfolios. In contrast, Ethereum's negative performance on all indices suggests investors may shift away from it to other currencies or traditional assets. This may be interpreted as a potential hedging tool during certain periods, making it a haven during adverse market conditions. This indicates - as the research suggested - the need to develop clearer regulatory frameworks that allow Bitcoin and Tether to be integrated alongside traditional investment products in investment portfolios.

                Xu et al. show that a developmental “switch” in the hypothalamus determines whether immature neurons become appetite suppressing or appetite stimulating. Disrupting this switch reshapes feeding behavior and protects mice from obesity, revealing how early-life programming shapes lifelong metabolic health.

                Combining intracellular and extracellular recordings, calcium imaging, and holographic circuit mapping, Hendricks et al. identify a feature-specific pyramidal cell-to-somatostatin interneuron microcircuit in the visual cortex. This tuned “like-to-like” pattern of excitatory synaptic architecture implements contextual computations that may underlie figure/ground perception.

                Loss of maternal SETDB1, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, leads to developmental arrest prior to implantation, with very few mouse embryos advancing beyond the eight-cell stage, which is currently unexplained. We genetically investigate SETDB1’s role in the epigenetic control of the transition from totipotency to pluripotency—a process demanding precise timing and forward directionality. Through single-embryo total RNA sequencing of two-cell and eight-cell embryos, we find that <i>Setdb1</i><sup>mat-/+</sup> embryos fail to extinguish one-cell and two-cell transient genes—alongside persistent expression of MERVL retroelements and MERVL-driven chimeric transcripts that define the totipotent state in mouse two-cell embryos. Comparative bioinformatics reveals that SETDB1 acts at MT2 LTRs and MERVL-driven chimeric transcripts, which normally acquire H3K9me3 during early development. The dysregulated targets substantially overlap with DUXBL-responsive genes, indicating a shared regulatory pathway for silencing the two-cell transcriptional program. We establish maternal SETDB1 as a critical chromatin regulator required to extinguish retroelement-driven totipotency networks and ensure successful preimplantation development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109447">Single molecule counting detects low-copy glycine receptors in hippocampal and striatal synapses</a></h4>

              
                Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord, where they regulate motor and sensory processes. GlyRs are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane by strong interactions of the β subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though <i>Glrb</i> mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here, we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas of the telencephalon. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRβ, we identified few GlyRs in sub-regions of the hippocampus. Dual-colour SMLM revealed that these sparse receptors are integrated within the postsynaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.

                Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values can be used to estimate the viral burden of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and predict population-level epidemic trends. We investigated the use of epidemic transmission modeling and machine learning (ML) based on Ct value distribution for SARS-CoV-2 incidence prediction in British Columbia, Canada during an Omicron subvariant BA.1-predominant period from November 2021 to January 2022. Using real-world data, we developed an epidemic transmission model that was first validated on outbreak data, and subsequently fitted to province-level data to predict incidence. Using simulated data, we developed a ML pipeline including five models to predict the reproductive number as a measure of transmission potential based on Ct value distribution, and validated it on out-of-sample province-level data. The epidemic transmission model demonstrated accurate prediction with the real incidence falling within the 95% credible interval of the predicted MCMC chains for both the long-term care facility outbreak, and province-level data. The ML models demonstrated good performance with a median mean squared error (MSE) lower than 0.17 across all models, and improved performance with increasing sample size. The variability of the Ct distribution around the mean was the strongest predictor of the reproductive number. These modeling approaches demonstrated utility for incidence and reproductive number prediction, and have potential to complement traditional surveillance in real time to guide public health interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104543">Frictional instabilities as an alternative to friction coefficient in fine touch perception</a></h4>

              
                Fine touch perception is often correlated to material properties and friction coefficients, but the inherent variability of human motion has led to low correlations and contradictory findings. Instead, we hypothesized that humans use frictional instabilities to discriminate between objects. Here, we constructed a set of coated surfaces with minimal physical differences, but due to differences in surface chemistry, generated different types of instabilities depending on how quickly a finger is slid and pressed during sliding. In one experiment, we used a mechanical mock finger to quantify and classify differences in instability formation from different coated surfaces. In a second experiment, participants perform a discrimination task using the same coated surfaces. Using the data from these two experiments, we found that human discrimination response times were faster with surfaces where the mock finger produced more stiction spikes and discrimination accuracy was higher where the mock finger produced more steady sliding. Conversely, traditional metrics like surface roughness or average friction coefficient did not relate to tactile discriminability. In fact, the typical method of averaging friction coefficients led to a spurious correlation which erroneously suggests that distinct objects should feel identical and identical objects should feel distinct—similar to findings by others. Friction instabilities may offer a more predictive and tractable framework of fine touch perception than friction coefficients, which would accelerate the design of tactile interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108237">Adjoint propagation of error signal through modular recurrent neural networks for biologically plausible learning</a></h4>

              
                Biologically plausible learning mechanisms have implications for understanding brain functions and engineering intelligent systems. Inspired by the multi-scale recurrent connectivity in the brain, we introduce an adjoint propagation (AP) framework, in which the error signals arise naturally from recurrent dynamics and propagate concurrently with forward inference signals. AP inherits the modularity of multi-region recurrent neural network (MR-RNN) models and leverages the convergence properties of RNN modules to facilitate fast and scalable training. This framework eliminates the biologically implausible feedback required by the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, and allows concomitant error propagation for multiple tasks through the same RNN. We demonstrate that AP succeeds in training on standard benchmark tasks, achieving accuracies comparable to BP-trained networks while adhering to neurobiological constraints. The training process exhibits robustness, maintaining performance over extended training epochs. Importantly, AP supports flexible resource allocation for multiple cognitive tasks, consistent with observations in neuroscience. This framework bridges artificial and biological learning principles, paving the way for energy-efficient intelligent systems inspired by the brain and offering a mechanistic theory that can guide experimental investigations in neuroscience.

                Lesion network mapping (LNM) has emerged as a popular framework to map the network mechanism of brain disorders using lesions and normative brain connectome (NBC). It was first demonstrated in neurological symptoms and was rapidly extended to a broad range of brain disorders in the past decade. A recent study by Van den Heuvel et al. questioned the methodological foundations of LNM. We here raise concerns regarding their errors and biases in the methodology and visualization. The conclusion of that study-LNM maps circumscribed brain changes mostly to one and the same outcome-is not supported by the data presented.

">Compound and sex specific medial prefrontal cortex rewiring after prenatal THC and CBD exposure</a></h4>

              
                The growing perception of cannabinoids as benign has increased perinatal exposure to both Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), yet their long term effects on prefrontal circuitry remain incompletely defined. Here we used whole cell and field electrophysiology in adult mice (P90-120) of both sexes to compare how in utero exposure to THC or CBD (GD5-18) remodels layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We quantified intrinsic excitability, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, the net E/I ratio, spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents kinetics, and canonical forms of synaptic plasticity (endocannabinoid mediated LTD and NMDA dependent LTP). Both cannabinoids shifted the adult mPFC toward a more pro excitatory state: the E/I ratio was altered in a compound and sex dependent manner, and endocannabinoid mediated LTD was abolished across groups. THC recapitulated previously reported deficits, producing male specific increases in intrinsic excitability and accelerating excitatory current kinetics in females, demonstrating a conserved cross species vulnerability of prefrontal circuits to gestational THC. CBD produced distinct signatures: female offspring showed marked increases in spontaneous excitatory event frequency and amplitude, indicating large scale reorganization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, while male offspring exhibited a selective and profound impairment of LTP. The combination of universal eLTD loss and CBD specific LTP impairment in males yields a bidirectional loss of plasticity: an emergent synaptic rigidity in which circuits are unable to potentiate or depress effectively. Together, these convergent and divergent effects establish that prenatal exposure to THC and CBD produces lasting, sex dependent rewiring of mPFC circuitry. Our results caution that the non intoxicating profile of CBD does not preclude durable developmental impact and underscore the importance of considering both compound identity and sex when assessing the neurodevelopmental risks of perinatal cannabinoid exposure.

">Sleep affects low-gamma range effective cortical connectivity for 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses</a></h4>

              
                The 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is a sensitive marker of changes in arousal level, which has been reported to decrease in amplitude during deep sleep. However, sleep-related changes in directional connectivity during 40 Hz ASSR through cortical networks remain underexplored. In this study, we examined how wakefulness, NREM (N1, N2, N3) and REM sleep affect the direction and extent of signal flow in 40 Hz ASSR. 64-channel EEG data were collected in an overnight study from 29 healthy, normal-hearing subjects during periodic 40 Hz auditory stimulation. A source analysis was implemented to locate cortical activity, and we assessed effective connectivity using the Directed Transfer Function (DTF) in the low-gamma (37-43 Hz) band. Here we investigated the relationship between prefrontal (dorsolateral and, anterior prefrontal cortex) and temporo-parietal associative (temporoparietal junction, posterior intraparietal lobule) and auditory (primary auditory cortex, supratemporal gyrus) cortices. We hypothesized that (i) feedback connections from higher-order associative cortices to auditory areas are the most affected by the arousal changes, (ii) associative reciprocal connectivity between prefrontal and parietal regions progressively weakens and shows a reduction in the number of maintained connections with increasing NREM sleep depth, with partial restoration observed during REM sleep. Our results showed that feedforward rather than feedback connectivity was most strongly disrupted during sleep, particularly in deep NREM stages, contradicting our first hypothesis. In contrast, the second hypothesis was supported: reciprocal connectivity between prefrontal and parietal associative cortices significantly decreased with advancing sleep depth. Overall, these findings suggest that reduced cortical propagation of 40 Hz ASSRs during sleep primarily reflects a breakdown in bottom-up auditory-to-associative signal transmission, and a parallel weakening of reciprocal prefrontal-parietal coupling, both most pronounced in deep NREM and partially restored during REM sleep.

">Maintaining performance under pain is effortful: experimental and computational evidence</a></h4>

              
                Pain creates a competing demand on attention, though its impact on performance remains debated. Motivational-intensity theory predicts that resource reallocation can preserve output until motivational or capacity limits are reached. Forty adults took part in two preregistered experiments. They completed parallel cognitive (choice-reaction, n=20) and motor (isometric hand-grip, n=20) tasks at three difficulty levels while receiving warm, low, or high-pain heat stimulation on the opposite forearm. Across both domains, participants maintained performance despite painful stimulation. This preservation, however, relied on increased effort mobilization: perceived effort rose with pain intensity, while pain perception decreased during motor and cognitive task execution. Trial-wise computational modelling revealed that perceived effort was better predicted by subjective pain experience than by stimulus temperature, supporting a compensatory regulatory mechanism. Thus, maintained performance under pain reflects active resource allocation via effort, generalizable across cognitive and motor domains, but achieved at the cost of increased perceived effort.

We present Ataraxis, an open-source framework that provides hardware control capabilities spanning camera acquisition, microcontroller communication, precision timing, and inter-process coordination, while exposing these capabilities to AI agents through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and domain-specific skills. Critically, Ataraxis separates configuration-time AI assistance from runtime data acquisition, ensuring that experiments run deterministically regardless of AI service availability. We validate this architecture in a two-photon imaging and virtual reality rodent behavior platform, demonstrating up to order-of-magnitude reductions in hardware validation, integration, and personnel onboarding time.

">Brainwide dopamine dynamics across sleep-wake transitions</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in regulating arousal and transitions between sleep states, yet brainwide dynamics underlying these transitions remain incompletely characterized. Here, we employed multi-site fiber photometry with the dopamine sensor GRAB-DA2m, combined with electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) recordings, to systematically assess regional dopamine (DA) dynamics across sleep-wake states in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatal subregions, central amygdala (CeA), and midbrain nuclei in mice. We found that DA levels prominently increased in the mPFC, dorsolateral striatum (DLS), ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during transitions from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to wakefulness (WAKE), supporting their role in arousal. Conversely, DA decreased in the CeA and nucleus accumbens lateral parts (NAc-L) during these transitions. During transitions from NREM to rapid eye movement sleep (REM), DA elevations were observed in the CeA and middle accumbens subregion (NAc-M), rather than NAc-L, while other regions exhibited decreases. Cross-regional DA correlations revealed synchronized network activity across sleep-wake transitions. Optogenetic activation of VTA and DRN dopamine neurons induced robust DA release in cortical and subcortical regions, and chemogenetic activation promoted wakefulness selectively via VTA and DRN, but not SNc DA neurons. These results elucidate distinct brainwide DA dynamics across state transitions and highlight differential roles for DA signaling in modulating sleep-wake states.

">Color discrimination in action: High-throughput measurement in immersive VR</a></h4>

              
                Precise measurement of color discrimination across color space is limited by the time and effort required to collect large psychophysical datasets. We investigated whether immersive virtual reality (VR) can support high-throughput measurement of color discrimination without compromising data quality. A standard 4-alternative forced-choice odd-one-out task was embedded in an interactive VR environment inspired by the rhythm game Beat Saber, in which participants indicated the location of a chromatic target by slicing approaching cubes. Stimuli were presented on a color-calibrated VR headset, and chromaticities were specified in DKL space. Discrimination thresholds were measured for hue and chroma shifts around two reference colors. Participants sustained response rates of approximately one trial per second while maintaining stable performance. Thresholds replicated established asymmetries in color discrimination: hue thresholds were lower than chroma thresholds, and the hue-chroma ratio differed between color quadrants. A control experiment comparing VR-based slicing responses with matched keyboard responses revealed comparable psychometric fits and threshold estimates, indicating that motor engagement did not degrade measurement precision. Questionnaire measures further showed significantly higher intrinsic motivation, enjoyment, and stimulation in the immersive condition relative to a classic static psychophysical task, without increases in reported pressure or discomfort. These results demonstrate that calibrated immersive VR can yield reliable color discrimination measurements at substantially increased throughput, providing a scalable approach for mapping the metric structure of color space.

">Distinct Neural Signatures of Auditory Processing in Contact versus Non-contact Sports Athletes</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive sub-concussive head impacts are emerging as one of the most urgent and overlooked challenges in neurotrauma. Despite growing evidence of their neurological consequences, there is no validated objective biomarker for early and reliable detection. Cortical (N100) and subcortical (frequency following responses) to a speech syllable presented in (1) quiet and (2) six-talker background noise listening conditions were assessed using EEG in 60 tier-2 athletes (30 contact, 30 non-contact; age-, sex-, height-, body mass- and BMI-matched). Reduced cortical N100 amplitudes in contact athletes were confirmed by a significant group effect (F(1,54)=9.16, p=.004), indicating early auditory cortical dysfunction as a measurable biomarker of sub-concussive exposure. Contact athletes also exhibited subtle hearing deficits and impaired self-reported speech perception, linking neural changes to real-world communication deficits. These findings were not related to cortical response amplitudes, suggesting that peripheral and cortical changes may occur independently following repetitive head impacts. Response timing and subcortical encoding were unaffected under both listening conditions. Our findings establish a selective auditory cortical vulnerability to repeated sub-concussive head impact exposure, providing the basis of an objective EEG-based monitoring tool that could help support athlete brain health and safety, and inform future research in contact sports.

">Human Cognitive Ability and the P300 Event-Related Brain Potential</a></h4>

              
                Human intelligence is essential to understand complex ideas, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to learn from experience, and to adapt to new situations by taking thought. The P300 event-related brain potential has been related to intelligence scores and thus represents as a promising biomarker of general cognitive ability. However, empirical results are characterized by enormous heterogeneity, and a quantitative assessment of this literature is lacking. This preregistered meta-analysis provides the first systematic overview of neuroscientific studies that have examined associations between general cognitive ability and the P300 in healthy adult participants. Out of 5641 articles screened, 49 studies with up to 381 effects were eligible for PRISMA-based meta-analytic comparison. Study quality was evaluated using a novel Study Design and Implementation Assessment Device, which we developed particularly for Individual Difference Research (DIAD-ID) and provide together with our analysis code as free online resources to support future meta-analyses. Confirming our hypotheses, a small but significant positive across-study association was observed for general cognitive ability and P300 amplitudes (r = .13; 95%-CI [.06, .19]), while a significant negative across-study association was revealed for P300 latencies (r = -.18; 95%-CI [-.24, -.13]). Study heterogeneity was substantial, and sub-analyses highlighted potential moderators such as type of the task during EEG recording. We discuss limitations, open questions, and provide concrete guidelines for future research on the neurobiological underpinnings of individual differences in cognitive ability.

">Brief online mindfulness meditation training modulates heart rate variability during post-stress meditation</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly delivered online, yet evidence for short programs often relies on self-report outcomes. We tested whether a brief online mindfulness meditation training produces detectable changes in autonomic regulation during a standardized stress-to-meditation sequence. Healthy adults with no meditation experience were randomized to a four-week online mindfulness meditation program (MG) or an active health-management program (CG). Before and after training, participants completed a laboratory session consisting of rest, a mental arithmetic stress task, guided focused-attention breathing meditation, and post-rest while ECG was recorded. Across the training period, both groups showed reduced negative affective symptoms, but only the mindfulness group showed an increase in the Observing facet. Critically, frequency-domain HRV indices during the laboratory protocol showed a group-specific post-training pattern: MG exhibited lower LF/HF and higher normalized HF power (nHF) compared with pre-training, and MG differed from CG in the post-training session. Within MG, training-related improvement in FFMQ Non-reactivity was positively associated with nHF during the post-stress meditation period. These findings indicate that a brief online mindfulness program can modulate HRV during a stress-to-meditation context and that post-stress autonomic modulation during meditation covaries with acceptance-related skill acquisition.

">Application of Explainable AI in Neuroscience: Enhancing Autism Screening</a></h4>

              
                The main challenges in the life of a child with autism are difficulties in communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early diagnosis of this neurodevelopmental disorder improves patient outcomes by enabling more effective, personalized interventions. This diagnosis can sometimes be difficult, especially in very young children. Non-invasive, relatively accessible, and able to reflect neural function in real time, electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise in the detection of Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, because EEG data is still difficult for experts to understand, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are beginning to be used in this field as well. In this paper, a ResNet+BiLSTM hybrid deep network was applied and achieved high accuracy in distinguishing individuals with autism from neurotypical subjects. Since AI models typically provide predictions without clear explanations, this study employs explainable AI (XAI) methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to clarify their decision-making.Delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves, as well as ERP components P100, N100, P200, MMN, and P600, were analyzed in the two neurotypical and autistic groups that were compared in this study using EEG recordings. By integrating SHAP and LIME, the system achieved both accurate classification and transparent explanations, pointing to EEG- and ERP-based features as reliable biomarkers for ASD.

">Large cranial windows distort sensory maps and degrade feature integration in higher-order cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how sensory information is transformed along cortical hierarchies requires reliable measurement of sensory representations across areas. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging through chronic cranial windows has become an essential approach for characterizing cortical sensory representations with cellular resolution and spatial registration across experiments. However, cortical computations, particularly in higher-order cortices, depend on intricate intracortical circuitry and can be sensitive to subtle tissue perturbations introduced during surgical preparation. Here, we report that implantation of large cranial windows can mechanically compress the intrinsically curved cortical surface, producing systematic distortion that is usually not recognized as overt tissue damage. By comparing sensory maps in the mouse auditory cortex before and after window implantation, we show that larger windows commonly used across laboratories are associated with distorted sensory maps away from the center of the window. Furthermore, both macroscopic and cellular-level imaging reveal a deterioration of feature-selective responses in the secondary auditory cortex (A2) following such distortion. Together, these findings identify an overlooked but controllable surgical factor that can bias measurements of sensory representations and highlight an important consideration for enhancing reproducibility across studies.

">The contribution of endocytic mediators to itch transmission</a></h4>

              
                Chronic itch is a major burden, impacting the quality of life for one in four adults, and is closely associated with increased levels of anxiety, depression, and suicide. Despite its widespread burden, the precise mechanisms driving and sustaining chronic itch remain poorly understood. Non-histaminergic itch transmission in the spinal cord relies on the synaptic vesicle (SV) release of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and the subsequent binding to the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR). While SV exocytosis facilitates neurotransmitter release, such as GRP, SV endocytosis, mediated by key proteins including clathrin, adaptor associated kinase 1 (AAK1), and Dynamin (Dnm) are essential for retrieving and recycling SV from the presynaptic membrane to maintain signaling. Building upon evidence that AAK1- and Dnm-mediated endocytosis are viable targets to reverse pain, we characterized the role of these endocytic mediators in the regulation of synaptic transmission in itch pathways. We localized mRNA encoding AAK1, Dnm1 and Dnm3 within GRP positive neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Genetic and pharmacological disruption of AAK1 significantly reduced scratching behavior compared to control groups. This anti-pruritic effect correlated with confirmed Aak1 mRNA knockdown in both the DRG and spinal cord. Similarly, siRNA mediated knockdown of Dnm1 and Dnm3 in the DRGs also reduced scratching behavior. Crucially, these treatments decreased GRP release without altering locomotor activity or anxiety-like behaviors. Together, these findings suggest that the disruption of SV recycling reduces itch related signaling and behavior without affecting normal motor functions, providing a new approach for chronic pruritus.

">Quantifying the Emergence of Population-Level Activity in Neuronal Systems</a></h4>

              
                Collective neural phenomena, such as oscillations and avalanches, are high-level neural signatures observed in aggregated spiking neuronal activity which have been consistently associated with a range of cognitive functions. However, it is often hard to elucidate whether such phenomena are mere epiphenomena or have causal or informational relevance. In this work, we investigate this question by leveraging recent information-theoretic tools to identify emergent phenomena between relevant scales of neural activity. For this, we propose a computational framework combining information-theoretic and network science principles, which we use to investigate emergence in both in-vivo datasets and in-silico simulations. Our approach enables characterisation of emergence phenomena, identifies the relevant scales at which they take place, and elucidates the network-level mechanisms that underpin them. Results show that in-vivo neuronal oscillations show substantial emergent behaviour for smaller prediction delays, while avalanches maintain their emergent nature for larger timescales. These results are supported by in-silico simulations, which show that the emergent signature of oscillations is facilitated by the network structure and interneuronal time-delays. Overall, these results highlight the role of network-level interactions between groups of neuronal assemblies as the key driver of emergent population activity in the brain.

">Absence of homeostatic downscaling in dentate gyrus granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus fire at exceptionally low rates in order to maintain sparse neural codes. Despite the need for granule cells to remain in such relative quiescence, the mechanisms that regulate their firing rates have not received much attention. We investigated the potential of family of mechanisms, homeostatic downscaling, that could theoretically maintain granule cell firing at preferential levels following chronically elevated activity. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of reduced synaptic input or intrinsic excitability in granule cells even after prolonged exposure to GABAA receptor blockade. In fact, we found that mini excitatory postsynaptic current frequency was elevated in granule cells after prolonged exposure to GABAA antagonists. This effect was consistent across blockers or when cell firing was driven by elevated extracellular K+, and did not rely on NMDA receptors, L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels or thrombospondin-driven synaptogenesis. However, the magnitude of long-term potentiation was reduced at synapses onto granule cells after prolonged exposure to a GABAA antagonist in vivo. We conclude that granule cells are the first known cell type that do not display homeostatic downscaling. Instead, these cells rely on other mechanisms, including metaplasticity, to maintain their activity within optimal bounds.

">GD3 synthase deficiency disrupts Na+/K+-ATPase and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase function in mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                GD3 synthase (GD3S) is a key enzyme in the production of gangliosides, sialylated membrane glycosphingolipids with essential physiological roles in mammalian brains. To elucidate the molecular bases of neuropathological findings associated with GD3S deficiency, we performed a multilayered analysis focused on the functionality of ion transporters Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) in the cortex and cerebellum of GD3S-deficient mice (GD3S-/-). We examined global transcriptomes, NKA and PMCA gene and protein expression, the influence of membrane lipid composition on lipid raft integrity, and the activity of both ATPases, pairing them with an exploratory principal component analysis. Transcriptomic data reveal that sets of genes involved in ion transport and membrane dynamics are differentially expressed in the absence of GD3S, whereas qRT-PCR data confirm changes in gene expression of specific NKA and PMCA subunits or isoforms. Altered protein expression and significantly lower activity of both NKA and PMCA were found in the cerebral cortex of GD3S-/- mice. Detailed lipidomic analysis revealed segregation of cholesterol into lipid rafts, which may lead to disordered membrane lipid architecture in GD3S deficiency. Additionally, altered ganglioside composition was found to affect the activities of NKA and PMCA in the brain tissue of GD3S-/- mice. Our results confirm that an imbalance in membrane ganglioside composition leads to significant alterations in ion transporter function. Experimental restoration of ATPase activity in cortical homogenates by administering exogenous b-series gangliosides may aid in developing therapeutic strategies targeting deficits in GD3S and other enzymes of ganglioside biosynthesis.

">Visual experience drives functional reorganization of cortical GABAergic circuits</a></h4>

              
                Sensory deprivation leads to extensive cortical plasticity, but the impact of enhanced sensory experience on the mature cortex remains poorly understood. Here, we examine how visually evoked activity in cortical circuits is shaped by repeated exposure to varied stimuli. The most prominent pattern of visually evoked activity in mouse primary visual cortex, beta oscillations (15-30Hz), arises from brief events of neural synchrony with a characteristic pattern of laminar propagation and relies on the activity of somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABAergic interneurons. We find that visually evoked beta activity is initially weak but robustly potentiated by repeated exposure to a diverse visual stimulus set, leading to enhanced recruitment of cortical neurons by these rhythmic network events. Cellular imaging further reveals that visual experience leads to increased visual responses in SST interneurons and suppressed responses in vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) GABAergic interneurons. In association with this rebalancing of inhibitory circuits, visual experience enhances visual selectivity in nearby pyramidal neurons. Visual experience thus selectively reorganizes adult dendrite-targeting inhibitory circuits, promoting network synchrony and enhancing sensory encoding by cortical excitatory projection neurons.

">Heterogeneous and specific localization of mRNAs at dendritic spine and its dependence on microtubule entry and kinesin motor</a></h4>

              
                Local mRNA translation near neuronal synapses is believed to underlie changes in connectivity during long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation, yet how the mRNAs localize at synapses is not well-studied. In particular, whether different dendritic mRNAs might display differential synaptic localization via interaction with specific proteins remains unexplored. Here we found that two well-known dendritic mRNAs, Actb and Camk2a are targeted to different subdomains of dendritic spines and delivered to different spine populations in response to chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Surprisingly, the induced mRNA localization to dendritic spines is associated with microtubule entry and depends on the kinesin motor protein KIF5A. Proximity-labelling proteomic further identifies distinct postsynaptic proteins enriched by the two mRNAs, with selected candidates showing mRNA co-localization at dendritic spines. Our study provides new insights on the heterogeneous localization of mRNAs at the synapses and demonstrates proximity-labelling as a useful approach to identify their synaptic partners that might contribute to their differential distribution.

">Unsupervised Representation Learning Generates Differentiable Neurophysiological Profiles</a></h4>

              
                Recent neuroimaging research has shown that human brain activity expresses stable, individual-specific features that persist over months to years, defining neurophysiological profiles. Current model-based profiling relies on labeled data and supervised learning, leaving open whether they exploit idiosyncratic artifacts or genuine biology. We introduce a participant-agnostic autoencoder framework to derive differentiable profiles from brief segments of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Despite an unsupervised objective, discriminative profiles emerged naturally from the learned latent space, outperforming model-free and model-based baselines in participant differentiation. Reliable differentiation was achieved using recordings as short as 14 s, generalized across recording sessions, and remained robust without anatomical information. Beyond differentiation, learned profiles predicted age more accurately than baselines, and the decoder enabled perturbation-based sensitivity analyses directly in spectral and connectivity spaces. These results establish participant-agnostic modeling as a principled and interpretable framework for neurophysiological profiling that generalizes across sessions while preserving sensitivity to biologically relevant individual differences.

">Local demyelination rekindles oligodendrocyte precursor dynamics and remyelination in old age</a></h4>

              
                Cortical myelination is critical for circuit function, plasticity, and long-term stability in the adult brain. With age and disease, the capacity to restore myelin after oligodendrocyte (OL) loss declines, and this failure is thought to reflect intrinsic limitations of OL precursor cells (OPCs) and a loss of permissive cues within the cortical environment. Here, using single-OL ablations and intravital imaging in mice, we show that as cortical remyelination efficiency declines, OPC motility declines, a phenomenon that can be mimicked by blocking CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Counter to prevailing notions, however, we find that even in aging, OPCs retain the capacity to generate new OLs and sheath axons, which can be rekindled by a graded demyelinating stimulus, inducing a more juvenile OPC motile state. This reveals an unrecognized remyelination potential in aging and identifies OPC dynamics as a key determinant of cortical remyelination, a property that could be targeted to improve myelin repair.

">Neuronal Cell-Cycle Re-entry Defines Divergent Outcomes Through Replication-Dependent DNA Damage in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Cell-cycle dysregulation has emerged as a shared mechanism of neuronal loss across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In post-mitotic neurons, aberrant reactivation of cell-cycle signaling precedes degeneration, yet the upstream triggers and functional consequences of this process remain poorly defined. Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) dysfunction, a hallmark of ALS and related disorders, disrupts the spatial distribution of key regulatory proteins and may contribute to maladaptive cell-cycle activation. Our recent evidence suggests that impaired nuclear import may initiate, rather than merely accompany, neuronal cell-cycle re-entry. Here, we show that cell-cycle activation in motor neurons distinguishes molecular subtypes and outcomes in ALS. We analyzed the AnswerALS transcriptomic cohort and identified a patient cluster characterized by robust upregulation of cyclins B and D. Clusters with lower levels of cell-cycle gene expression exhibited accelerated ALSFRS-R decline, whereas the highest cyclin-expressing cluster demonstrated comparatively improved functional trajectories over time. To test whether NCT disruption can mechanistically drive aberrant cell-cycle activation, we pharmacologically inhibited importin-{beta} in human iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons. NCT disruption induced widespread proteomic mislocalization, including TDP-43 pathology, and triggered a transient wave of cell-cycle activity preceding neuronal death. Mechanistically, we identified DNA-replication initiation as a pathological event driving degeneration and demonstrated that selective inhibition of G1/S-associated CDK4/6 activity confers neuroprotection. Together, these findings link impaired nuclear import to maladaptive cell-cycle reactivation in neurons and highlight stage-specific engagement of the cell-cycle machinery as a determinant of neuronal vulnerability in ALS.

">Hierarchical Signatures of Language in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Language relies on a hierarchy of sensory and cognitive processes, yet how different levels of this hierarchy are supported by distinct neural architectures remains unclear. Here we show that semantic processing, compared with phonological processing, is associated with higher-level brain networks, as characterized by resting-state fMRI connectivity, in vivo measures of cortical myelin, and cortical types derived from a cytoarchitecture-defined reference atlas. These relationships were established using individualized ultra-high field fMRI in both English and French speakers leveraging a multi-session, multi-modal 7T MRI protocol including a language localizer. For comparison, we developed an artificial neural network, in which a representational hierarchy spontaneously emerged where phonological information was captured in earlier layers and semantic information in later layers. By integrating individualized functional mapping, neuroanatomical characterization and artificial intelligence, this study advances understanding of the neural basis of language and provides a framework for linking biological and artificial systems of communication.

">Selective Cortical Myelination Reflects Axon-Driven Progression of the BCAS1-positive Oligodendrocyte Lineage</a></h4>

              
                Myelination in the cerebral cortex is sparse, discontinuous, showing marked heterogeneity across cortical areas and along individual axons, yet the mechanisms that establish this complex and selective architecture remain unclear. Using histological mapping of oligodendrocyte lineage cells across cortical areas combined with longitudinal in vivo imaging, we find that initial myelination is highly targeted: up to 80 percent of the earliest segments arise consecutively along the same subset of axons. We observed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells enter a premyelinating BCAS1-positive state even within cortical regions that remain poorly myelinated or unmyelinated. However, the progression beyond early premyelinating morphologies correlates with local myelin levels and with interactions with specific neuronal partners. BCAS1-positive ensheathments show a preferential stabilisation and elongation along parvalbumin interneurons compared with somatostatin interneurons, linking regional neuronal composition to differential myelin levels. These findings indicate that cortical myelination emerges from intrinsic lineage programs that are refined through selective interactions with axons, thereby linking neuronal diversity to cortical myelin distribution and providing a framework to understand why remyelination may fail in regions where myelination supportive neuronal populations are reduced.

">Differences in dynamic motor selection in stuttering</a></h4>

              
                Stuttering involves interruptions to the smooth flow of speech occurring mostly at syllable onset. Speech fluency is enhanced in people who stutter (PWS) by external timing cues. This has been taken to indicate that difficulties in the temporal organisation of action selection and initiation during speech contribute to stuttering. An important unanswered question is whether putative temporal coordination difficulties are specific to speech or generalize to other actions. Here, we examined the temporal organisation of hand action selection in PWS. Twenty PWS and twenty typically fluent speakers (TFS) underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording while performing a visuomotor working-memory task that encouraged temporally specific selection, preparation and shifts between hand actions. Lateralised sensorimotor mu/beta-frequency (8-30 Hz) activity modulation accompanying hand-action prioritisation was weaker in PWS than TFS. Strikingly, this effect was specific to a period of high uncertainty regarding which action to select and when. Despite these differences, behavioural performance was well matched between PWS and TFS, and sensorimotor mu/beta activity was functionally relevant for task performance in both groups. The findings suggest a general disruption of temporal structuring of action selection and preparation in stuttering.

">Temporo-Occipital and Medial Temporal Networks Underlying Object-Location Learning</a></h4>

              
                Object-location memory (OLM), a fundamental component of spatial memory, is essential for everyday functioning yet declines with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently implicated medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as medial and lateral temporo-occipital regions, in object-location associative learning. However, the neural mechanisms and functional network interactions supporting OLM acquisition remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we examined twenty healthy adults (18-45 years) performing an object-location learning task during functional MRI. As a first main finding, task-related functional connectivity analyses revealed enhanced coupling between MTL structures, ventral visual regions, and temporo-occipital cortices during OLM learning. Secondly, stronger connectivity within this network was associated with higher learning accuracy, highlighting the behavioral relevance of coordinated cortical-MTL interactions. Thirdly, these connectivity patterns were not static but evolved across learning stages: interregional coupling was strongest during early learning and progressively attenuated as performance stabilized, suggesting sharpening and increased efficiency of network interactions with learning. Together, our results provide mechanistic insight into OLM acquisition at the functional network level and offer an evidence-based framework for identifying target networks to enhance spatial memory through non-invasive brain stimulation.

">The hippocampus enables abstract structure learning without reward</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning (SL) allows organisms to infer latent structure from sensory input without instruction, feedback, or reward, yet how the brain accomplishes such abstract, unsupervised learning remains unknown. Here we show that mice, like humans, rapidly acquire multiple forms of statistical structure, including event frequency, sequence identity, and abstract structural rules, and that the hippocampus is essential for this capacity. Pupil dynamics provided a cross-species, implicit readout of expectation formation, revealing spontaneous sensitivity to these regularities during passive listening. In mice, pharmacological and temporally precise optogenetic inactivation of dorsal CA1 abolished all learning-related pupil signatures without affecting baseline pupil size, target-evoked responses, or task performance, demonstrating a causal requirement for the hippocampus in forming and updating internal models of sensory structure. High-density recordings further revealed that dCA1 ensembles track evolving statistical contexts while dynamically reorganising population activity into subspaces that separately encode sensory features and abstract rules, enabling generalisation across distinct but structurally equivalent sequences. Together, these results identify the hippocampus as a critical neural substrate for latent abstract structure learning and offer a mechanistic account of how internal models emerge from unsupervised experience.

">RNA-seq variants reveal distinct patterns in the aging epitranscriptome: an in-depth analysis of age-matched Alzheimer's Disease patients and a cognitively normal cohort</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-transcriptional modifications are those made to the RNA transcript, which can modulate RNA stability and function. Despite robust investigation of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, little is known about post-transcriptional modifications during normal aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Several studies have shown epitranscriptomic changes in AD brains for certain modification types, establishing epitranscriptomic links to the disease; however, the complete set of post-transcriptional modifications have not been assessed in the context of AD. Furthermore, it is not understood which genes or pathways are under epitranscriptomic regulation, how conserved and sporadic modifications are distributed, or which conserved sites are differentially modified in diseased brains. Therefore, there is a need for a more complete analysis to describe the full landscape of the epitranscriptome in AD, helping to bridge the knowledge gap between post-transcriptional modifications and the molecular etiology of AD. Methods: We designed and implemented a novel bioinformatics pipeline for complex epitranscriptome-wide analysis of potential RNA modification sites in sample-matched, whole-genome sequencing-filtered variant calls from RNA sequencing data. Using parametric and non-parametric tests, we tested differences in patterns for all detectable variant calls between postmortem brains of AD and cognitively normal, aged individuals. Results: We identified 544 genes with hyper-modified transcripts in AD samples compared with cognitively normal controls, a notable observation being high enrichment of genes in the "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus" pathway. We also identified patterns of recurring and sporadic modification sites that differed complementarily between disease and non-disease conditions. We found 17 genes (33 total sites) that were differentially modified between conditions including several sites found exclusively in the AD epitranscriptome. Conclusions: These findings provide a more complete profile of the potential molecular underpinnings which differentiate AD brains from their non-diseased, aged counterparts and reveal patterns and modification sites which can be further investigated for how they contribute to the network of molecular interactions underlying AD. These elements are likely to be valuable candidates for investigations that aim to further the search for biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

">Learning sculpts orthogonal task manifolds for continual skill learning in recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can learn and seamlessly perform a vast repertoire of behaviors. However, how neural populations incorporate new skills without disrupting previously learned ones remains poorly understood. This challenge is known as catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks and is especially severe in recurrent networks, where computation relies on stable internal dynamics. While current machine learning approaches often rely on explicit weight-protection strategies, such approaches do not directly address this challenge. Here we show that orthogonal task manifolds can emerge in recurrent neural networks from a local predictive, error-driven learning rule. Our model preserves task-specific latent dynamics that remain resilient to interference from subsequent learning. Using low-rank connectivity ablations, we causally isolate these latent dynamics, selectively impairing individual tasks while leaving others intact. We further show that the proposed principle generalizes beyond low-dimensional to high-dimensional naturalistic movie replay, suggesting a scalable mechanism for continual learning. Our results identify a solution to catastrophic forgetting by preserving previously learned dynamics in recurrent connectivity, thereby providing a mechanistic bridge between artificial recurrent networks and biological neural circuits.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning from outcomes can rely on distinct computational processes, but how internal motivational states shape these processes during visual perceptual learning (VPL) remains unclear. We investigated how fasting versus satiety modulates feedback processing during an orientation discrimination task with identical reward contingencies, using functional MRI. Both fasted and non-fasted participants showed significant VPL. However, only the fasted group exhibited enhanced post-error accuracy, reflecting increased sensitivity to error information without significantly greater net learning. At the neural level, whole-brain analyses revealed state-dependent dissociations: during fasting, decision-locked activity in the ventral striatum decreased from pre- to post-training, consistent with attenuated prediction-error signaling as outcomes became predictable, whereas under satiety, learning was accompanied by declining activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting reduced reliance on executive control. Region-of-interest analyses further showed that fasting selectively enhanced feedback-related responses to incorrect outcomes in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and primary visual cortex, and these error-related responses were associated with individual differences in perceptual improvement. Together, these results demonstrate that while VPL emerges under both motivational states, motivational state determines how learning is expressed, with fasting promoting error-sensitive, outcome-monitoring learning regime and satiety favoring a more control-driven mode of performance optimization.</span>

                This study aims to examine how psychological, cognitive, and contextual factors are associated with entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial action distinguishing between discovery and exploitation phases among university students in five Latin American countries. Using a cross-national design, the analysis combines non-parametric statistical techniques, correlation and regression models, and visual analytics through raincloud plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report focuses on those that showed significant cross-country differences or emerged as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in the discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase, whereas financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants of the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive entrepreneurship curricula that integrate emotional competencies, stage-specific training pathways, and institutional support strategies.

                The emergence of COVID-19 vaccines has reshaped the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic, offering hope for widespread immunity. Beyond conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines have exhibited intriguing immunomodulatory effects. This research explores the dynamic interplay among VDR mRNA expression levels, calcium (ionized and total), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations in individuals post-COVID-19 vaccination. The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and is closely intertwined with calcium homeostasis. This study investigates the hypothesis that COVID-19 vaccination may induce alterations in VDR mRNA expression, subsequently influencing calcium metabolism and iPTH secretion. Our findings reveal dynamic shifts in VDR mRNA expression following COVID-19 vaccination, with distinct patterns observed across individuals. Concurrently, we observe ionized and total calcium levels alterations, hinting at potential links between VDR activity and calcium metabolism post-vaccination. Furthermore, iPTH levels exhibit intriguing fluctuations, suggesting a regulatory role of VDR in parathyroid hormone secretion. The integration of clinical outcomes and vaccine response data sheds light on the significance of these molecular and biochemical alterations. This research underscores the multifaceted impact of COVID-19 vaccination on VDR mRNA expression, calcium homeostasis, and iPTH regulation. Beyond the scope of vaccination, our findings may bear implications for immunomodulation in various disease contexts, particularly in individuals with pre-existing calcium-related disorders. In conclusion, our study unveils the intricate relationships among VDR mRNA expression, calcium levels, and iPTH concentrations in the context of post-COVID-19 vaccination. These discoveries extend our understanding of vaccine-induced immunomodulation and may pave the way for personalized vaccination strategies, while also opening new avenues for investigating the role of VDR in immune responses and calcium regulation beyond the pandemic.

                Background The rising consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is a global concern, given their poor nutritional quality and the presence of multiple additives that may pose health risks when consumed in excess. Young populations are particularly vulnerable due to lifestyle habits and the widespread availability and accessibility of these products. The present study aimed to assess the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), taking into account the co-occurrence of additives and their association with risk factors in a young population. Methods A two-phase cross-sectional study was conducted. In the first phase, 500 ultra-processed food products available on the Peruvian market were analysed and classified into five groups: meat products, cereals, confectionery, dairy, and beverages, in order to identify the presence and frequency of additives. In the second phase, a structured survey was administered to 385 students, collecting data on UPF consumption over the previous 24 hours, along with variables related to lifestyle. Chi-square tests and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyse the associations. Results The categories with the highest levels of consumption were carbonated beverages (59.6%), meat products (54.7%), and dairy in various forms (66.3%). A high frequency of co-occurrence was identified between colourings and acidulants, particularly INS 133, INS 150d, and INS 339i. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between UPF consumption and male sex (OR = 1.603), as well as alcohol consumption (OR = 2.059), while age showed an inverse relationship (OR = 0.756). Other variables, such as physical activity and smoking, did not demonstrate a significant association. Conclusion It is concluded that excessive UPF consumption varies according to age and sex and represents a continuous source of exposure to food additives. In addition, a statistically significant association was observed between UPF consumption and alcohol consumption, which may indicate a relationship of relevance from a public health perspective; however, a causal relationship cannot be established.

                Background The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste poses environmental and sustainability challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature and limited disposal options. Repurposing PET as aggregates in structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) offers a dual benefit of waste valorisation and conservation of natural resources, while supporting circular economy objectives. Methods Eight experimental mix proportions of SLWC were developed using a factorial design approach, with water–to–cement ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. PET aggregates were produced via thermal–mechanical processing and subjected to calcium hypochlorite treatment to improve surface bonding with cement paste. Standard tests were conducted to determine workability (Vebe time), fresh and dry densities, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water absorption. Structural efficiency was also computed as a strength-to-weight performance indicator. Results The fresh and dry densities of the PET-based SLWC ranged from 1455–1515 kg/m3 and 1490–1537 kg/m3, respectively, corresponding to category D1.6 lightweight concrete. Compressive strengths ranged between 14.1 and 16.5 MPa, fulfilling the LC13 classification for structural applications. Splitting tensile strengths were between 0.84 and 1.4 MPa, with several mixes achieving minimum thresholds for structural performance. Water absorption values ranged from 4.66% to 10.16%, remaining within international standards for lightweight concrete durability. Workability was low (Vebe times 13–40 s), attributed to the angular and hydrophobic properties of PET aggregates. Structural efficiency values of 9.5–10.9 kPa·m3/kg exceeded minimum international requirements. Conclusions This study confirms that PET aggregates can be successfully utilised to produce structurally viable and durable lightweight concrete. Although workability is reduced, the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, and durability criteria align with international standards. These results demonstrate a sustainable strategy for PET waste valorisation in construction, contributing to resource conservation, reduced environmental burden, and advancement of circular economy goals.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Introductıon The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of apocynin in a selenite-induced cataract model, and to evaluate its impact on cataract severity and antioxidant enzyme activities. Given the limited availability of pharmacological strategies to delay cataract progression, the identification of agents that modulate oxidative stress may provide translational insight for the development of future non-surgical approaches. Methods In this randomized experimental study, thirty-five rats were randomly separated into five groups (n = 7 per group). The control group received only saline. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were administered sodium selenite at a dose of 30 nmol/g. In addition, Group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Group 3 received 10 mg/kg apocynin, and Group 4 received 20 mg/kg apocynin. The apocynin treatment was administered intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Cataract severity was defined as the primary outcome, while antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results Low-dose apocynin was seen to enhance antioxidant defence by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels (p = 0.003, p = 0.002) without altering malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p = 0.04). High-dose apocynin (20 mg/kg) led to an increase in MDA, suggesting a possible dose-related pro-oxidant effect. Conclusion This study suggests that apocynin, particularly at a low dose (10 mg/kg), may prevent selenite-induced cataract formation. Low-dose apocynin effectively delayed cataract progression by enhancing antioxidant defence and limiting oxidative stress. In contrast, high-dose exposure revealed a possible pro-oxidant effect, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics, and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts are needed in the sequels which are playing a major role in verifying our major outcomes have been presented. Throughout this manuscript, ( X , ≼ ) indicates to a partially ordered set with the partially ordered ≼ . In this study, our main objective is to investigate and verify various new enhanced results of coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. Numerous characterizations of these types of coupled fixed point theorems have been verified. Additionally, an appropriate example that supports the major outcomes was prepared. Conclusions Our main results in this manuscript have been explored novel various outcomes related to the uniqueness of various coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. We predict that the discoveries in this study will aid scientists in enhancing the research on popularized partially ordered metric spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations.

                Background The derivation of novel biomarkers from biomedical data to accurately predict individual patient’s responses, would be an advance. We hypothesized that quantitative AI designed to analyze complex data, based on evolutionary computation, could identify algorithmic biomarkers from baseline data in a clinical trial, predictive of individual therapeutic responses. Methods A previously published randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo was analyzed. Baseline peripheral blood gene expression data, plus the treatment variable, infliximab or placebo, yielding 52,379 variables were available for 59 patients. The variable for analysis was a decrease in Disease Activity Score-28 (DSA28) score of 1.2. At 14 weeks, 20 of the 30 patients receiving infliximab had responded, and ten of the 29 patients receiving placebo had responded. Findings The AI derived a discovery algorithm, with 4 gene expression variables plus treatment assignment, that predicted responders versus non-responders for all 59 patients, with 100% accuracy. We present the discovery algorithm to enable transparent verification. Excluding the 4 gene expression variables, we then derived similarly accurate predictive algorithms with 4 other gene expression variables. We tested the hypothesis that the software could derive algorithms as predictors of treatment response applying just these 8 discovery gene expression variables to 6 previously published independent datasets. In each validation analysis, the accuracy of the algorithmic predictors surpassed those benchmarks previously reported, using a variety of analytic approaches. Conclusions AI based on evolutionary computation summarized a clinical trial, with transparent biomarker algorithms derived from baseline data, correctly predicting the outcome for all patients. The biomarker variables, validated in 6 independent cohorts, are now in development as a clinical test. This approach may expedite the discovery of companion diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-264/v1?src=rss">Legal Reform and Digital Citizenship: A Comparative Study of Cyberbullying Laws in Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background The purpose of this research is to compare regulations related to cyberbullying in Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan, and to explore digital citizenship as a long-term preventive measure. The phenomenon of cyberbullying is increasing in these three countries, becoming a serious challenge in the context of mental health and the protection of citizens in the digital age. Methods This research employs a methodological approach that combines juridical normative analysis with analytical and comparative research. It analyzes the laws of each country, starting from the Electronic Information and Transactions Law (ITE Law) in Indonesia, the Network Act in South Korea, and the Japanese Penal Code. Results The results of the study show that South Korea has the most comprehensive regulatory framework, encompassing both penal and non-penal approaches. At the same time, Japan excels in enforcing flexibility and protecting victims, even though it does not yet have a special constitution. On the other hand, Indonesia still faces weaknesses in its legal framework, as there is no explicit definition, and reactive approaches are still emerging. Conclusions Research highlights the importance of adaptive legal reform in dynamic technological environments and recommends integrating digital citizenship into national curricula to prevent cyberbullying. Implementing the nine elements of digital citizenship, according to Ribble, involves being a framework-relevant work in the form of ethical and responsible digital citizens who are aware of the law.

                Background The Transportation Problem (TP) is a detailed model in operations study with applications in logistics, supply chain management, and resource allocation. The classical IBFS methods including North-West Corner, Least Cost and Vogel’s Approximation have competitive computational efficiency, but they are very sensitive to the structure of the problem and usually lead to a solution that is far from the global optimum. Classic enhancement strategies like the Generalized Distribution (MODI) and Stepping-Stone (SS) approaches have low computational complexity but may fall into a local optimum quickly, which makes them ineffective in large-scale or unbalanced problems. Methods We propose the first generic hybrid algorithm, called Ester Hybrid Improvement for Transportation Problem (EHITP), which was developed with the aim of mitigating the shortcomings of traditional IBFS-based methods. To overcome the local minima problem, the proposed EHITP framework combines adaptive perturbation procedures and guided neighborhood search methodologies to broaden the solution space. Results Initial experiments on benchmark and synthetically created datasets show that EHITP obtains a much less total transportation cost relative to the classical IBFS and improved MODI/SS methods. These features lead to a more robust method, stable solutions over iterations, and convergence across a wider range of problem sizes and structures. Conclusions The findings show EHITP serves as a more reliable, scalable, and expense-effective solution to transportation issues. The balance this algorithm achieves between the quality of the solution it produces, and its computational efficiency makes it a potential candidate for real life applications in topics such as distribution chain and economic resource allocation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-262/v1?src=rss">Improving the characteristics of mozzarella cheese manufactured in an unconventional way and fortified with nanosalt and studying the effect of freezing on it [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mozzarella cheese is a soft, moisture-rich cheese that is highly sensitive to storage conditions, impacting its physical and chemical properties. By salting mozzarella cheese with nanosalt and comparing it to chilling and freezing, this study aimed to improve its physicochemical and sensory properties. Methods By milling, nanosodium chloride was created. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze shape and structure. Citric acid was added to samples of mozzarella cheese made from cow’s milk. A cooled control (T1), a frozen sample (T2), with 0.5% nanosalt added (T3), 1% nanosalt added (T4), and 1.5% nanosalt added (T5) comprised the five groups of samples. Changes in moisture, protein and fat contents, pH, acidity, ash content, and sensory assessment were all measured in the samples. Results From electron microscopy show the presence of sodium chloride, with tiny nanoparticles exhibiting irregular and sometimes cubic shapes. The samples ranged in dimensions from 36.99 nm to 70.59 nm. Chemical tests on mozzarella cheese stored under various conditions showed significant differences (p≤0.05) in moisture content (52.74% vs. 49.91%) and ash content (2.99% vs. 3.89%). The protein content varied between 25.00% and 25.90% across treatments, remaining unchanged. Fat percentage, pH and acidity measurements showed no significant differences between the treatments. Sensory analysis of the mozzarella cheese samples that were preserved using various techniques revealed that the samples’ sensory qualities were maintained within reasonable bounds for the duration of storage. No differences in appearance, opening, or color were found, confirming these traits are stable. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in taste, texture, and flavour were found, with the largest in T3–T5 where nanosalt was added, showing its positive impact on sensory quality versus cooling and freezing alone. The weight reduction effects for mozzarella cheese varied significantly (p≤0.05) between the treatments (T1-T5) after 21 days, with values ranging from 26.95 to 92.50. Treatment T5 produced the least amount of weight loss when compared to the other treatments. Conclusion Adding nanosalt to mozzarella cheese formulations enhances quality, shelf life, and resistance to freezing flaws, while maintaining sensory and textural qualities and offering a valuable alternative for traditional preservation methods.

                This paper presents a systematic investigation of a newly defined comprehensive subclass of analytic and univalent functions in the open unit disk. The introduced function class constitutes a broad generalization that incorporates several significant families, particularly Yamaguchi functions and starlike functions, which themselves exhibit fundamental properties within the established Bazilevič function hierarchy. The formal construction of this class employs the Ma-Minda framework through the application of subordination principles, set-theoretic operations, and analytical formulations involving infinite series and product combinations of specific geometric expressions. The principal contributions of this work include the derivation of sharp coefficient bounds, complete solutions for the Fekete-Szegö problem with parameters, and precise estimates for Hankel determinants containing a real parameter. The proposed class demonstrates remarkable generality, as it systematically reduces to numerous well-established function classes when its parameters are specialized to particular values within their defined domains, thereby providing a unified approach to studying these classical families.

                Background Bootstrap resampling is used throughout biology to perform critical statistical tasks, including estimating confidence intervals as part of statistical inference and learning. A key assumption of bootstrap resampling is that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), but this assumption is at odds with the inherently sequential nature of biomolecular sequences. To relax this simplifying assumption, RAWR (“RAndom Walk Resampling”) was introduced as a technique for sequence-aware statistical resampling. RAWR has been applied to several different biomolecular sequence analysis tasks to date, including phylo- genetic tree support estimation. In each of these tasks, RAWR produces comparable or superior results to the bootstrap method and state-of-the-art resampling methods. Methods and Results A comprehensive software suite for RAWR resampling of unaligned biomolecular sequence data has been developed. Version 1.0 of the distribution focuses on two essential applications in computational biology and bioinformatics: (1) phylogenetic support estimation and (2) estimating confidence intervals on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The software implementation includes a local Galaxy client, a desktop PC client with a graphical user interface (GUI), and a standalone web server application. Access to software library functionality is provided via a developer-friendly application programming interface (API). User and developer documentation and tutorials are also provided. Availability and Implementation The software suite, documentation, and tutorials are publicly available under an open-source copyleft license at https://github.com/kjl-msu/RAWR-web-software. The software and API are implemented in Python for use on macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

                Abstract: Considering the accelerating digital transformation, organizations are increasingly relying on digital technologies to enhance customer experience, boost satisfaction and loyalty, and build a positive brand image. Websites are among the most important digital interaction channels influencing customer behavior, particularly in the banking sector. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between website quality and Electronic loyalty (EL), while also examining the mediating role of customer knowledge management (CKM). Despite the increasing number of studies examining website quality and its role in enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, most of these studies have focused on the direct relationship between website quality and EL, neglecting the explanatory role of mediating variables, particularly customer knowledge management. Furthermore, previous literature has rarely addressed this topic within the context of banking institutions in developing countries, and more specifically within the Iraqi environment, which is characterized by distinct regulatory and technological features. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing the relationship between website quality and EL, while also examining the mediating role of CKM in the Iraqi banking sector. To achieve this objective, a descriptive-analytical approach was adopted, and the study was applied to Al-Rafidain Bank in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM). The analysis revealed significant correlations and influences between website quality and EL. The results also indicated that CKM plays a mediating role in strengthening this relationship, highlighting its importance in explaining online customer behavior. The study concludes that improving website quality, along with adopting effective CKM practices, contributes to enhancing EL in the banking sector. The findings also provide theoretical and practical insights that can support decision-makers in developing more effective digital strategies.

                As the global population ages, creating supportive environments for walking is a priority for public health and urban planning. While empirical studies are numerous, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge regarding the underlying theoretical constructs used to understand these environments. This systematic literature review examines the theoretical frameworks and conceptual models that define the relationship between the built environment and walking behaviors of older adults. Specifically, it explores the antecedents within these models that influence walkability. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted focusing on publications that present or utilize theoretical frameworks for older adult walkability. Papers were analyzed based on their research focus categorized into model development, testing, advancement, or integration and their contribution type to the field. The review identifies a range of theoretical approaches, examining dominant theoretical frameworks within the Built Environment for Walkability (BEW) and its social and policy extensions. Findings suggest that while many models are described as “holistic,” they vary significantly in how they weigh individual, social, and environmental factors. The analysis highlights a shift toward model integration as a means to address the multi-dimensional nature of aged-friendly environments. By focusing on theoretical antecedents rather than purely empirical outcomes, this review provides a roadmap for future research to refine existing models. It emphasizes the need for a more consistent definition of the socio-built environment to better support the mobility of older populations.

                Background insomnia is common at any age; however, it is more prevalent among medical students due to the competitive environment they live. Stress is thought to be a primary contributor in the development of insomnia due to its two-way relationship with the disorder. The objective of this study is to assess sleep quality among medical students and explore the relation between insomnia and the level of stress they experience. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students from Anbar and Fallujah universities in Anbar province/Iraq. All students who agreed to participate were included in the study. The presence of insomnia was evaluated according to the Athens insomnia scale (AIS-8). The level of stress was measured according to the perceived stress scale (PSS-10). Results The total number of participants was 452, 72.8% of whom reported insomnia. Low-stress level was experienced by 8.4%, moderate stress by 60.0%, and high perceived stress by 31.6% of the respondents. Level of stress was significantly associated with gender (p< 0.001), with prevalence of insomnia among females (42.5%) been higher than that among males (30.3%). Logistic regression model revealed that students with high perceived stress had OR of 3.188 for insomnia compared to those with low level of stress (C.I. 2.1-4.8, P<0.001). Conclusion Prevalence of insomnia among medical students is high, statistically attributed to stress. The findings of the study encourage adopting certain programs to enhance awareness of medical students about this problem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1001/v2?src=rss">The Use of Clear Aligner Therapy for Orthognathic Surgery Patients: A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Saudi Orthodontists and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Orthognathic surgery corrects severe skeletal discrepancies that cannot be addressed by orthodontics alone. With advancements in digital workflows and CAD/CAM technologies, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential adjunct in surgical cases. However, its clinical application remains under-researched. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Saudi Arabia regarding CAT in orthognathic surgery patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 31, 2023, using a closed-ended online questionnaire distributed to specialists across Saudi Arabia. The survey gathered demographic and clinical data. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, chi-square testing (p < 0.05), and univariate regression to identify demographic predictors of CAT use. Results Out of 278 expected responses, 46 (16.5%) were received. Most participants were aged 31–40 years (p < 0.05) and had 6–10 years of experience (p = 0.03). Orthodontists accounted for 65.2% of the respondents, with oral and maxillofacial surgeons at 34.8% (p = 0.03). While most treated 1–4 orthognathic patients monthly, 80% had no experience using CAT in these cases. Although general CAT usage was significant (p < 0.05), its clinical application in orthognathic surgery was minimal. Challenges included pre-surgical alignment, intraoperative fixation, and post-operative occlusion control. Regression analysis showed that age was significantly associated with CAT use (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.38), while gender and experience were not. Conclusion The study indicates limited clinical experience with CAT in orthognathic surgery in Saudi Arabia. Age may influence CAT adoption, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and inform future integration of aligner protocols in surgical orthodontics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-257/v1?src=rss">Integrative Healthcare for Optimal Health [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Conventional medicine and public health have collectively improved health and saved the lives of millions. Yet, as we confront the escalating crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it becomes increasingly clear that conventional approaches alone are no longer sufficient. A new, evidence-based paradigm shift is necessary. Integrative health, which combines conventional medicine with complementary and lifestyle medicine, offers that shift. To assess its effectiveness, we identified and reviewed 14 clinical trials published within the past 5 years in widely read, high-impact factor journals (and their sub-specialty counterparts) – including The New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, the BMJ and JAMA. These trials directly compared integrative health interventions with conventional medical treatments across conditions such as insomnia, obesity, age-related disorders, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease. The included trials assessed outcomes related to mental health, pain management, and quality of life. Across these studies, we found that integrative health interventions were consistently associated with improved health outcomes. While we acknowledge that stronger evidence is needed, the research findings represent an important step toward exploring a well-balanced, evidence-based approach to integrative health.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70084?af=R">Upstream CB1R Regulation of β‐Adrenergic Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Object recognition memory (ORM) plays a key role in identifying familiar items and encoding episodic information. ORM consolidation depends on β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling and is associated with increased BDNF expression in the dorsal hippocampus. Although hippocampal activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) is known to impair ORM consolidation, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In this study, we used the novel object recognition task to examine the interaction between CB1Rs and βARs during ORM consolidation in adult male Wistar rats. Intra-dorsal CA1 infusion of the CB1R agonist ACEA, the βAR antagonist propranolol, or the PKA inhibitor myristoylated PKI<sub>14–22</sub>, administered 5-min post-training, impaired ORM consolidation. Notably, co-administration of the PKA activator 8Br-cAMP or the βAR agonist isoproterenol reversed ACEA-induced amnesia. In contrast, the CB1R inverse agonist AM251 failed to reverse propranolol-induced amnesia, which was instead rescued by recombinant BDNF infusion into the hippocampus 120-min post-training. These findings suggest that hippocampal CB1Rs regulate ORM consolidation by acting upstream of βARs via a signaling cascade involving PKA activation and BDNF expression.</p>

Scientific data management is at a critical juncture, driven by exponential data growth, increasing cross-domain dependencies, and a severe reproducibility crisis in modern research. Traditional centralized data management approaches are not only struggling with data volume but also fail to address the fragmentation of research results across domains. This hinders scientific reproducibility and cross-domain collaboration and increases concerns about data sovereignty and governance. This article proposes FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems as an improved architectural pattern for future research data ecosystems. It tries to incorporate the latest advancements in decentralized, distributed systems into existing research infrastructure to promote cross-domain collaboration. Based on established patterns from Data Commons, Data Meshes, and Data Spaces, our approach focuses on a layered architecture that consists of governance, data, service, and application layers. With this, it could be possible to preserve domain-specific expertise and control while facilitating data integration through standardized interfaces and semantic enrichment. Key requirements include adaptive metadata management, simplified user interaction, robust security, and transparent data transactions. Our architecture supports compute-to-data as well as data-to-compute paradigms, implementing a decentralized peer-to-peer network that scales horizontally. This article aims to provide both an impulse for the technical architecture as well as concepts for a governance framework so that FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems could enable researchers to build on existing work while maintaining control over their data and computing resources. This could provide a practical path towards an integrated research infrastructure that respects domain autonomy as well as interoperability requirements.

Despite decades of intensive research, our current approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases only slow down the seemingly inevitable. Could recent data associating vaccinations with reduced risk of dementia offer an unexpected beacon of hope?

Current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases largely manage symptoms and only modestly slow progression. This Perspective highlights emerging evidence that vaccines and antivirals may lower dementia risk by targeting viral triggers, opening new avenues for prevention.

                <p>by Pietro Pollo, Szymon M. Drobniak, Hamed Haselimashhadi, Malgorzata Lagisz, Ayumi Mizuno, Laura A. B. Wilson, Daniel W. A. Noble, Shinichi Nakagawa</p>

Biological differences between males and females are pervasive. Researchers often focus on sex differences in the mean or, occasionally, in variation, albeit other measures can be useful for biomedical and biological research. For instance, differences in skewness (asymmetry of a distribution), kurtosis (heaviness of a distribution’s tails), and correlation (relationship between two variables) might be crucial to improve medical diagnosis and to understand natural processes. Yet, there are currently no meta-analytic ways to measure differences in these metrics between two groups. We propose three effect size statistics to fill this gap: Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i>, which measure differences in skewness, kurtosis, and correlation, respectively. Besides presenting the rationale for the calculation of these effect size statistics, we conducted a simulation to explore their properties and used a large dataset of mice traits to illustrate their potential. For example, in our case study, we found that females show, on average, a greater correlation between fat mass and heart weight than males. Although calculating Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> will require large sample sizes of individual data, technological advancements in data collection create increase opportunities to use these effect size statistics. Importantly, Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> can be used to compare any two groups, allowing a new generation of meta-analyses that explore such differences and potentially leading to new insights in multiple fields of study.

                Background Total adrenalectomy (TA) is the standard approach for the management of unilateral adrenal tumors. However, TA leads to adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid replacement therapy, which may cause complications such as adrenal crisis, Cushing syndrome, obesity, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular disease. Partial adrenalectomy (PA) was then performed to preserve residual adrenal function and minimize the need for lifelong corticosteroid therapy. In unilateral adrenal tumors, higher recurrence rates with PA than with TA need to be considered. Given the variability in outcomes, a systematic review is needed to compare the outcomes of PA and TA in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Methods We searched the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2025. We used specific keywords, such as “partial adrenalectomy,” “total adrenalectomy,” and “unilateral adrenal tumor.” Three authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I. The primary outcomes included the operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were overall complications, hypertension, hypokalemia, and local recurrence. Results Eight studies involving 982 patients with unilateral adrenal tumors (adrenal adenoma, adrenal pheochromocytoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and other pathologies) were included. Partial adrenalectomy resulted in a significant reduction in hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -0.49 days; 95% CI −0.78 to −0.21; I2 = 0%; p = 0,0006). There were no statistically significant differences in operative time, blood loss, overall complications, postoperative hypertension and hypokalemia, or recurrence between the TA and PA. Conclusions Partial adrenalectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay than total adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Some outcomes showed high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

                Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection demonstrates significantly elevated prevalence among hemodialysis populations worldwide, with particularly high rates in Middle Eastern countries. Despite this epidemiological pattern, limited evidence exists regarding the impact of HCV infection on hemostatic complications following arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled 460 patients diagnosed with ESRD requiring AVF creation at three tertiary hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq (Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital, Ibn-Al-Nafees Teaching Hospital, and Al-Shaheed Ghazi Al-Hariri Surgical Hospital), between January 2017 and January 2024. Patients were stratified by HCV serological status using third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was hemostatic complications (bleeding requiring intervention or clinically significant hematoma) monitored for six weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included coagulation parameters, AVF maturation rates, and other vascular complications. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of complications. Results Among 460 patients, 151 (32.8%) tested positive for HCV. HCV-positive patients demonstrated significantly prolonged prothrombin time (19±5 versus 15±2.5 seconds, p<0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (40±4 versus 32±3 seconds, p<0.001), and reduced platelet count (153±43 versus 215±72 ×103/mm3, p<0.001). Hemostatic complications occurred in 28.5% of HCV-positive patients compared to 5.5% of HCV-negative patients (crude OR: 6.835, 95% CI: 3.597-12.987, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HCV infection emerged as the strongest independent predictor of hemostatic complications (adjusted OR: 5.892, 95% CI: 3.102-11.196, p<0.001). AVF maturation rates were significantly lower in HCV-positive patients (74.2% versus 86.4%, p=0.002). Conclusions Hepatitis C virus infection increases hemostatic complications following AVF creation nearly six-fold and adversely affects fistula maturation rates. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating HCV status into preoperative risk stratification and perioperative management protocols, particularly in high-prevalence regions.

                Background Informal employment and its impact on economic growth have been receiving greater attention, but less is known about their socioeconomic conditions and determinants of income in India. This column attempts to uncover the determinants of informal income and socioeconomic conditions with respect to migration status. Methods This study was based on primary investigation. Hence the data collection was performed on multi-stage stratified sampling method. The primary data has been collected through a structured questionnaire for the informal sector workers in Cuttack city of Odisha. The data analysis was completed by ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Results The income of migrant workers is more than the non-migrant workers due to their nature of work and pattern of payment, whereas the non-migrant workers are engaged in household services with lower payment. The important socio economic determinants such as category of land they lived, gender, various age groups of household head, migration status, availability of off-season support, type of employment, social group, religion, principal sectors, number of dependency, and members of the union are responsible for lower income of the informal workers. Conclusion For sustainable and equitable improvements in basic facilities such as housing, electricity, health, vocational education, social security and employment opportunity should be facilitated by the policy makers. In order to achieve these objectives, this study emphasized more on the mobile-education-services, MGNREGS programs and the MSMEs sector by which Sustainable Development Goals 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12, and 17 can simultaneously be achieved.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The taiep rat originated from a spontaneous mutation in a colony of Sprague–Dawley rats, whose phenotype is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mutant taiep rat shows hypomyelination and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been considered a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis and tubulinopathies. Unlike taiep rats, heterozygous rats for the mutation (+/−), referred to as carriers, have not been widely studied. Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine the dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of taiep mutation carriers. We evaluated the following groups: Sprague–Dawley rats as a control (SD), mutation carriers (Carrier), and taiep rats (taiep). The brains of the animals were processed using the Golgi-Cox technique to analyze the basilar and apical dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. We observed a decrease in dendritic arborization in the basilar arbors of dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in both carrier and taiep adult rats, as well as a decrease in dendritic arborization in the apical arbors of CA3 neurons in carrier rats. Moreover, dendritic spine density was reduced in CA1 neurons in both rats. These results show that even when rats are mutation carriers, they exhibit alterations in the dendritic arborization of dorsal hippocampal neurons similar to those of taiep rats.</p>

                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

                Background: Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with solid organ and hematological malignancies. Its occurrence in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is rare, with majority cases in pancreatic NETs. Here, we describe an extremely rare case of a metastatic duodenal NET presenting with severe hypercalcemia due to the secretion of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). This case features an exceptionally high PTHrP level, making it one of the most severe reported cases of NET-associated HHM. Case Presentation: A 70-year-old Indian male with hypertension and diabetes mellitus was found to have a well-differentiated Duodenal NET (grade 2, Ki67 index: 18.2%; T2N1M0). He underwent distal gastrectomy with D1 duodenal resection. Subsequent disease progression with hepatic and peripancreatic nodal metastases was managed with octreotide injections, Everolimus and Lutetium177 DOTATATE PRRT (Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy). Six months later, he presented with acute unresponsiveness and severe hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 14.06 mg/dL) with suppressed iPTH levels (Intact Parathyroid Hormone) and markedly elevated PTHrP levels of 252 pmol/L (Parathyroid Hormone related Peptide), thereby confirming HHM. Multiple myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis were excluded. Despite management with intravenous fluids, calcitonin, ibandronate, and multiple hemodialysis sessions, the patient succumbed to hypoxic brain injury. Discussion: We report a rare case of metastatic duodenal NET causing severe hypercalcemia due to excessive PTHrP production. With a remarkably elevated PTHrP level, this case is one amongst the most severe documented cases. The relationship between tumour grade and PTHrP production along with the refractory nature of the hypercalcemia, highlights the complex pathophysiology of this condition. Conclusion: PTHrP-mediated humoral hypercalcemia is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of duodenal NETs and is associated with adverse outcomes. Early recognition of this paraneoplastic syndrome, prompt metabolic correction, and timely escalation of NET-directed therapies, including consideration of PRRT, are crucial to improving clinical outcomes in patients with aggressive, receptor-positive disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-252/v1?src=rss">Experimental Investigation of H-Pile Performance in Layered Soils [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents an experimental study on the behavior of H-piles buried in a stratified soil section, considering variations in the position and depth of a weakly clay layer. Tests were conducted in a specially fabricated steel enclosure attached to a rigid load-bearing frame to impose a uniform stress and minimize boundary effects. The clay layer was placed at three depths: L1(top layer near the surface), L2 (middle layer, mid-depth of pile), and L3 (at the bottom, beneath the pile) and tested under four different textures: solid clay (SCL), semi-solid clay (SSCL), semi-liquid clay (SLCL), and liquid clay (LCL). Axial loading tests were carried out using a laboratory loading apparatus that adopted the general principles of ASTM D1143 in the method of applying the load and measuring the settlement, with some modifications made as needed to suit the tests of scale models. The test results indicated that the ultimate bearing capacity and overall load-bearing strength of the piles were strongly affected by the position and texture of the clay layer. A clay that is solid enhances resistance to piles, particularly in situations where the layer is near the surface and is supported by sand that is under the surface. However, liquid clay led to a significant reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the piles. Overall, the objective of the current research is to determine the combined effect of soil hardness, depth, and the soils surrounding the piles on the H-response of the piles in stratified soils in order to make certain recommendations that are somewhat practical for designing a foundation in soils with various subsurface characteristics.

                Human behavior relies on the ability to simplify complex goals using interim subgoals and the ability to plan using an internal model of the world. Grossman et al. demonstrate that the brain represents subgoals and computes values for choices in relation to those subgoals using a world model.

                McIlvried et al. report an inverse relationship between patient-reported pain and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with oral cancer. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in syngeneic mouse models, they establish that tumor-evoked nociceptor activation drives CGRP-mediated immunosuppression. They then show that CGRP receptor antagonism reduces both tumor-associated pain and immune evasion.

                Chen et al. have discovered that IGF signaling acts locally to promote the migration of a lymphatic vessel along the craniofacial cartilage. They also demonstrate that IGF1R signaling promotes both zebrafish and human lymphatic cell migration, indicating that IGF signaling has a conserved role in lymphatic-vessel development.

                Abou Karam et al. identify a cell communication mechanism used by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite delivers its mRNAs into monocytes and imports them into their protected nuclei, where they perturb the splicing. This extracellular RNA-based strategy disrupts host transcript processing and immune signaling, revealing another layer of host interference.

                Liu et al. reveal that vascular stiffening drives pulmonary hypertension by inducing EphB4 to undergo phase separation in smooth muscle cells. These condensates trap YAP inhibitors, unleashing pathogenic proliferation. A targeted peptide disrupts condensation and attenuates pulmonary hypertension in vivo, revealing a new mechanotherapeutic strategy.
