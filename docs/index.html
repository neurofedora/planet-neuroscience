	<p>Aggression is highly prevalent in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Previous studies have identified specific biobehavioral mechanisms underlying aggression in BPD, threat sensitivity being among them. We composited the mechanism-based anti-aggression psychotherapy (MAAP) in order to target these specific mechanisms, and MAAP was found to be superior to non-specific supportive psychotherapy (NSSP) in reducing aggressive behavior. In the present study, we investigated whether underlying brain mechanisms expected to be involved were affected by MAAP. To this end, n = 33 patients with BPD and overt aggressive behavior (n = 20 in MAAP, n = 13 in NSSP) and n = 25 healthy participants took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging emotional face-matching task before and after treatment, or at a similar time interval for controls. Overt aggressive behavior was assessed using the overt aggression scale, modified. Results showed a decrease in amygdala activation in response to facial stimuli after MAAP, whereas an increase in amygdala activation was found after NSSP. Furthermore, in the MAAP group, connectivity between amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex increased from pre- to post-treatment compared to the NSSP group. Hence, the results suggest an impact of MAAP on brain mechanisms underlying the salience circuit in response to threat cues.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Internal affective states produce external manifestations such as facial expressions. In humans, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is widely used to objectively quantify the elemental facial action units (AUs) that build complex facial expressions. A similar system has been developed for macaque monkeys&mdash;the Macaque FACS (MaqFACS); yet, unlike the human counterpart, which is already partially replaced by automatic algorithms, this system still requires labor-intensive coding. Here, we developed and implemented the first prototype for automatic MaqFACS coding. We applied the approach to the analysis of behavioral and neural data recorded from freely interacting macaque monkeys. The method achieved high performance in the recognition of six dominant AUs, generalizing between conspecific individuals (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) and even between species (<I>Macaca fascicularis</I>). The study lays the foundation for fully automated detection of facial expressions in animals, which is crucial for investigating the neural substrates of social and affective states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Optical Manipulations Reveal Strong Reciprocal Inhibition But Limited Recurrent Excitation within Olfactory Bulb Glomeruli</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The local circuitry within olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli filters, transforms, and facilitates information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to bulb output neurons. Two key elements of this circuit are glutamatergic tufted cells (TCs) and GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells, both of which actively shape mitral cell activity and bulb output. A subtype of TCs, the external TCs (eTCs), can synaptically excite PG cells, but there are unresolved questions about other aspects of the glomerular connections, including the extent of connectivity between eTCs and the precise nature of reciprocal interactions between TCs and PG cells. We combined patch-clamp recordings in OB slices and optophysiological tools to investigate local functional connections within glomeruli of mice and rats. When TCs that express cholecystokinin (CCK) were optically suppressed, excitatory inputs to "uniglomerular" PG cells that extend dendrites to one glomerulus were decreased, consistent with TC activation being required for most excitation of these PG cells. However, TC suppression had no effect on EPSCs in eTCs, arguing that TCs make few, if any, direct glutamatergic synaptic connections with eTCs. The absence of synaptic connections among eTCs was also supported by recordings in eTC pairs. Last, we show using similar optical suppression methods that GAD65-expressing PG cells, mainly uniglomerular cells, provide strong inhibition in eTCs. Our results imply that the local network of CCK-expressing TCs form potent reciprocal chemical synaptic connections with GAD65-expressing uniglomerular PG cells but not eTCs. This configuration favors local inhibition over recurrent excitation within a glomerulus, limiting its output.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcranial direct current stimulation of cerebellum alters spiking precision in cerebellar cortex: A modeling study of cellular responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xu Zhang, Roeland Hancock, Sabato Santaniello</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum has rapidly raised interest but the effects of tDCS on cerebellar neurons remain unclear. Assessing the cellular response to tDCS is challenging because of the uneven, highly stratified cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum, within which cellular morphologies, physiological properties, and function vary largely across several types of neurons. In this study, we combine MRI-based segmentation of the cerebellum and a finite element model of the tDCS-induced electric field (EF) inside the cerebellum to determine the field imposed on the cerebellar neurons throughout the region. We then pair the EF with multicompartment models of the Purkinje cell (PC), deep cerebellar neuron (DCN), and granule cell (GrC) and quantify the acute response of these neurons under various orientations, physiological conditions, and sequences of presynaptic stimuli. We show that cerebellar tDCS significantly modulates the postsynaptic spiking precision of the PC, which is expressed as a change in the spike count and timing in response to presynaptic stimuli. tDCS has modest effects, instead, on the PC tonic firing at rest and on the postsynaptic activity of DCN and GrC. In Purkinje cells, anodal tDCS shortens the repolarization phase following complex spikes (-14.7 ± 6.5% of baseline value, mean ± S.D.; max: -22.7%) and promotes burstiness with longer bursts compared to resting conditions. Cathodal tDCS, instead, promotes irregular spiking by enhancing somatic excitability and significantly prolongs the repolarization after complex spikes compared to baseline (+37.0 ± 28.9%, mean ± S.D.; max: +84.3%). tDCS-induced changes to the repolarization phase and firing pattern exceed 10% of the baseline values in Purkinje cells covering up to 20% of the cerebellar cortex, with the effects being distributed along the EF direction and concentrated in the area under the electrode over the cerebellum. Altogether, the acute effects of tDCS on cerebellum mainly focus on Purkinje cells and modulate the precision of the response to synaptic stimuli, thus having the largest impact when the cerebellar cortex is active. Since the spatiotemporal precision of the PC spiking is critical to learning and coordination, our results suggest cerebellar tDCS as a viable therapeutic option for disorders involving cerebellar hyperactivity such as ataxia.

The use of scientific web applications (SWApps) across biological and environmental sciences has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Although quantitative evidence for such increased use in practice is scant, collectively, we have observed that these tools become more commonplace in teaching, outreach, and in science coproduction (e.g., as decision support tools). Despite the increased popularity of SWApps, researchers often receive little or no training in creating such tools. Although rolling out SWApps can be a relatively simple and quick process using modern, popular platforms like R shiny apps or Tableau dashboards, making them useful, usable, and sustainable is not. These 10 simple rules for creating a SWApp provide a foundation upon which researchers with little to no experience in web application design and development can consider, plan, and carry out SWApp projects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise-trained deep neural networks effectively predict human vision and its neural responses to challenging images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hojin Jang, Devin McCormack, Frank Tong</p>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) for object classification have been argued to provide the most promising model of the visual system, accompanied by claims that they have attained or even surpassed human-level performance. Here, we evaluated whether DNNs provide a viable model of human vision when tested with challenging noisy images of objects, sometimes presented at the very limits of visibility. We show that popular state-of-the-art DNNs perform in a qualitatively different manner than humans—they are unusually susceptible to spatially uncorrelated white noise and less impaired by spatially correlated noise. We implemented a noise training procedure to determine whether noise-trained DNNs exhibit more robust responses that better match human behavioral and neural performance. We found that noise-trained DNNs provide a better qualitative match to human performance; moreover, they reliably predict human recognition thresholds on an image-by-image basis. Functional neuroimaging revealed that noise-trained DNNs provide a better correspondence to the pattern-specific neural representations found in both early visual areas and high-level object areas. A layer-specific analysis of the DNNs indicated that noise training led to broad-ranging modifications throughout the network, with greater benefits of noise robustness accruing in progressively higher layers. Our findings demonstrate that noise-trained DNNs provide a viable model to account for human behavioral and neural responses to objects in challenging noisy viewing conditions. Further, they suggest that robustness to noise may be acquired through a process of visual learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantitative image analysis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort observational study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury commonly associated with pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The resultant effect can be persistent lung damage, but its extent is not known. We used quantitative high resolution computed tomography (QHR-CT) lung scans to radiographically characterize the lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) survivors. Methods Patients with CARDS (N=20) underwent QHR-CT lung scans 60 to 90 days after initial diagnosis, while hospitalized at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). QHR-CT assessed for mixed disease (QMD), ground glass opacities (QGGO), consolidation (QCON) and normal lung tissue (QNL). QMD was correlated with respiratory support on admission, tracheostomy decannulation and supplementary oxygen need on discharge. Results Sixteen patients arrived with tracheostomy requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients arrived on nasal oxygen support. Of the patients included in this study 10 had the tracheostomy cannula removed, four remained on invasive ventilation, and two died. QHR-CT showed 45% QMD, 28.1% QGGO, 3.0% QCON and QNL=23.9%. Patients with mandatory mechanical ventilation had the highest proportion of QMD when compared to no mechanical ventilation. There was no correlation between QMD and tracheostomy decannulation or need for supplementary oxygen at discharge. Conclusions Our data shows severe ongoing lung injury in patients with CARDS, beyond what is usually expected in ARDS. In this severely ill population, the extent of mixed disease correlates with mechanical ventilation, signaling formation of interstitial lung disease. QHR-CT analysis can be useful in the post-acute setting to evaluate for interstitial changes in ARDS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simulation framework for connected vehicles: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) is a booming research field with a diverse set of services and applications. Most researchers rely on vehicular simulation tools to model traffic and road conditions and evaluate the performance of network protocols. We conducted a scoping review to consider simulators that have been reported in the literature based on successful implementation of V2V systems, tutorials, documentation, examples, and/or discussion groups. Methods: Simulators that have limited information were not included. The selected simulators are described individually and compared based on their requirements and features, i.e., origin, traffic model, scalability, and traffic features. This scoping review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The review considered only research published in English (in journals and conference papers) completed after 2015. Further, three reviewers initiated the data extraction phase to retrieve information from the published papers. Results: Most simulators can simulate system behaviour by modelling the events according to pre-defined scenarios. However, the main challenge faced is integrating the three components to simulate a road environment in either microscopic, macroscopic or mesoscopic models. These components include mobility generators, VANET simulators and network simulators. These simulators require the integration and synchronisation of the transportation domain and the communication domain. Simulation modelling can be run using a different types of simulators that are cost-effective and scalable for evaluating the performance of V2V systems in urban environments. In addition, we also considered the ability of the vehicular simulation tools to support wireless sensors. Conclusions: The outcome of this study may reduce the time required for other researchers to work on other applications involving V2V systems and as a reference for the study and development of new traffic simulators.

                Background: Since adsorption is a complex process, numerous models and theories have been devised to gain general understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The interaction between the adsorbates and adsorbents can be identified via modelling of the adsorption data with different adsorption isotherms as well as kinetic models. Many studies are also focused on developing predictive modelling techniques to facilitate accurate prediction of future adsorption trends. Methods: In this study, a predictive model was developed based on a multiple linear regression technique using existing data of As(V) adsorption onto several coated and uncoated magnetite samples. To understand the mechanisms and interactions involved, the data was first modelled using either Temkin or Freundlich linear isotherms.  The predicted value is a single data point extension from the training data set. Subsequently, the predicted outcome and the experimental values were compared using multiple error functions to assess the predictive model’s performance. Results: In addition, certain values were compared to that obtained from the literature, and the results were found to have low error margins. Conclusion: To further gauge the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately predicting future adsorption trends, it should be further tested on different adsorbent and adsorbate combinations.

                Background: Lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic brought deep changes to the daily lives of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), greatly increasing their amount of time spent at home. Methods: A cohort of 243 parents of children with ASD (2-15 years old) completed an original online survey regarding the child’s screen time and the modification of the ASD symptomatology during lockdown to investigate the relationship between them. Results: The data show that high solitary screen time is related with the worsening of ASD core symptoms. Conclusions: This study may help to increase awareness in the excessive use of screen in children with ASD during the lockdown, both during the pandemic as well as after it ends.

                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, diabetic patients have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviors of diabetic patients in Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviors were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the diabetes group had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, fewer of them were found to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The diabetes group reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Compared to the control group, diabetic patients in a rural community of Thailand had healthier sleep, lifestyle, and eating behaviors but not healthier exercise behaviors, especially among obese women. Diabetes prevention programs should emphasize and promote weight control and increasing levels of exercise.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Extrinsic control and intrinsic computation in the hippocampal CA1 circuit</a></h4>

              
                Zutshi et al. perform simultaneous silencing of major afferents into the hippocampal CA1 to address whether CA1 spiking can be sustained by local computations. These manipulations reveal that coordinated CA1 place cell assemblies persist with minimal input but that each input has distinct effects on spatial tuning and field potentials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A helicase-tethered ORC flip enables bidirectional helicase loading</a></h4>

              
                Replication origins are licensed by loading two Mcm2‑7 helicases around DNA in a head-to-head conformation poised to initiate bidirectional replication. This process requires ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Although different Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules load each helicase, whether two ORC proteins are required is unclear. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy combined with FRET, we investigated interactions between ORC and Mcm2‑7 during helicase loading. In the large majority of events, we observed a single ORC molecule recruiting both Mcm2‑7/Cdt1 complexes via similar interactions that end upon Cdt1 release. Between first and second helicase recruitment, a rapid change in interactions between ORC and the first Mcm2-7 occurs. Within seconds, ORC breaks the interactions mediating first Mcm2-7 recruitment, releases from its initial DNA-binding site, and forms a new interaction with the opposite face of the first Mcm2-7. This rearrangement requires release of the first Cdt1 and tethers ORC as it flips over the first Mcm2-7 to form an inverted Mcm2‑7-ORC-DNA complex required for second-helicase recruitment. To ensure correct licensing, this complex is maintained until head-to-head interactions between the two helicases are formed. Our findings reconcile previous observations and reveal a highly-coordinated series of events through which a single ORC molecule can load two oppositely-oriented helicases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopamine enhances model-free credit assignment through boosting of retrospective model-based inference</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is implicated in representing model-free (MF) reward prediction errors a as well as influencing model-based (MB) credit assignment and choice. Putative cooperative interactions between MB and MF systems include a guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. Here, we used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design to test an hypothesis that enhancing dopamine levels boosts the guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. In line with this, we found that levodopa enhanced guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference, without impacting MF and MB influences directly. This drug effect correlated negatively with a dopamine-dependent change in purely MB credit assignment, possibly reflecting a trade-off between these two MB components of behavioural control. Our findings of a dopamine boost in MB inference guidance of MF learning highlights a novel DA influence on MB-MF cooperative interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How the insect central complex could coordinate multimodal navigation</a></h4>

              
                The central complex of the insect midbrain is thought to coordinate insect guidance strategies. Computational models can account for specific behaviours but their applicability across sensory and task domains remains untested. Here we assess the capacity of our previous model (Sun et al., 2020) of visual navigation to generalise to olfactory navigation and its coordination with other guidance in flies and ants. We show that fundamental to this capacity is the use of a biologically-plausible neural copy-and-shift mechanism that ensures sensory information is presented in a format compatible with the insect steering circuit regardless of its source. Moreover, the same mechanism is shown to allow the transfer cues from unstable/egocentric to stable/geocentric frames of reference providing a first account of the mechanism by which foraging insects robustly recover from environmental disturbances. We propose that these circuits can be flexibly repurposed by different insect navigators to address their unique ecological needs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo diversity is mediated by the combinatorial assembly of FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotic cells, intracellular components are organized by the microtubule motors cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) and kinesins, which are linked to cargos via adaptor proteins. While ~40 kinesins transport cargo toward the plus end of microtubules, a single dynein moves cargo in the opposite direction. How dynein transports a wide variety of cargos remains an open question. The FTS-Hook-FHIP ('FHF') cargo adaptor complex links dynein to cargo in mammals and fungi. As human cells have three Hooks and four FHIP proteins, we hypothesized that the combinatorial assembly of different Hook and FHIP proteins could underlie dynein cargo diversity. Using proteomic approaches, we determine the protein 'interactome' of each FHIP protein. Live-cell imaging and biochemical approaches show that different FHF complexes associate with distinct motile cargos. These complexes also move with dynein and its cofactor dynactin in single-molecule in vitro reconstitution assays. Complexes composed of FTS, FHIP1B, and Hook1/Hook3 co-localize with Rab5-tagged early endosomes via a direct interaction between FHIP1B and GTP-bound Rab5. In contrast, complexes composed of FTS, FHIP2A and Hook2 colocalize with Rab1A-tagged ER-to-Golgi cargos and FHIP2A is involved in the motility of Rab1A tubules. Our findings suggest that combinatorial assembly of different FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes is one mechanism dynein uses to achieve cargo specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ZAF, the first open source fully automated feeder for aquatic facilities</a></h4>

              
                In the past few decades, aquatic animals have become popular model organisms in biology, spurring a growing need for establishing aquatic facilities. Zebrafish are widely studied and relatively easy to culture using commercial systems. However, a challenging aspect of maintaining aquatic facilities is animal feeding, which is both time- and resourceconsuming. We have developed an open-source fully automatic daily feeding system, Zebrafish Automatic Feeder (ZAF). ZAF is reliable, provides a standardized amount of food to every tank, is cost-efficient and easy to build. The advanced version, ZAF+, allows for the precise control of food distribution as a function of fish density per tank, and has a user-friendly interface. Both ZAF and ZAF+ are adaptable to any laboratory environment and facilitate the implementation of aquatic colonies. Here we provide all blueprints and instructions for building the mechanics, electronics, fluidics, as well as to setup the control software and its user-friendly graphical interface. Importantly, the design is modular and can be scaled to meet different user needs. Furthermore, our results show that ZAF and ZAF+ do not adversely affect zebrafish culture, enabling fully automatic feeding for any aquatic facility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bidirectional synaptic plasticity rapidly modifies hippocampal representations</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires neural adaptations thought to be mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reverting the mode of action of the mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase by Legionella pneumophila preserves its replication niche</a></h4>

              
                <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, the causative agent of Legionnaires'; disease, a severe pneumonia, injects <i>via</i> a type-IV-secretion-system (T4SS) more than 300 proteins into macrophages, its main host cell in humans. Certain of these proteins are implicated in reprogramming the metabolism of infected cells by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) early after infection. Here we show that despite reduced OXPHOS, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>) is maintained during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). We reveal that <i>L. pneumophila</i> reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a T4SS-dependent manner, which leads to a conservation of the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, preserves mitochondrial polarization and prevents macrophage cell death. Analyses of T4SS effectors known to target mitochondrial functions revealed that <i>Lp</i>Spl is partially involved in conserving the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, but not LncP and MitF. The inhibition of the <i>L. pneumophila</i>-induced 'reverse mode' of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase collapsed the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and caused cell death in infected cells. Single-cell analyses suggested that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in hMDMs that conserved the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and showed delayed cell death. This direct manipulation of the mode of activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is a newly identified feature of <i>L. pneumophila</i> allowing to delay host cell death and thereby to preserve the bacterial replication niche during infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task Demands Change Motion Information Coding in Area MT of the Macaque</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primate Middle Temporal (MT) area signal information about visual motion and work together with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) to support memory-guided comparisons of visual motion direction. These areas are reciprocally connected and both contain neurons that signal visual motion direction in the strength of their responses. Previously, LPFC was shown to display marked changes in stimulus coding with altered task demands. Since MT and LPFC work together, we sought to determine if MT neurons display similar changes with heightened task demands. We hypothesized that heightened working-memory task demands would improve the task-relevant information and precipitate memory-related signals in MT. Here we show that engagement in a motion direction comparison task altered non-sensory activity and improved stimulus encoding by MT neurons. We found that this improvement in stimulus information transmission was largely due to preferential reduction in trial-to-trial variability within a sub-population of highly direction-selective neurons. We also found that a divisive normalization mechanism accounted for seemingly contradictory effects of task-demands on a heterogeneous population of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human neural networks with sparse TDP-43 pathology reveal NPTX2 misregulation in ALS/FTLD</a></h4>

              
                Human cellular models of neurodegeneration require reproducibility and longevity, which is necessary for simulating these age-dependent diseases. Such systems are particularly needed for TDP-43 proteinopathies, which involve human-specific mechanisms that cannot be directly studied in animal models. To explore the emergence and consequences of TDP-43 pathologies, we generated iPSC-derived, colony morphology neural stem cells (iCoMoNSCs) via manual selection of neural precursors. Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and comparison to independent NSCs, showed that iCoMoNSCs are uniquely homogenous and self-renewing. Differentiated iCoMoNSCs formed a self-organized multicellular system consisting of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons, which matured into long-lived functional networks. Neuronal and glial maturation in iCoMoNSC-derived cultures was similar to that of cortical organoids. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 in a minority of iCoMoNSC-derived neurons led to progressive fragmentation and aggregation, resulting in loss of function and neurotoxicity. scRNA-seq revealed a novel set of misregulated RNA targets coinciding in both TDP-43 overexpressing neurons and patient brains exhibiting loss of nuclear TDP-43. The strongest misregulated target encoded for the synaptic protein NPTX2, which was consistently misaccumulated in ALS and FTLD patient neurons with TDP-43 pathology. Our work directly links TDP-43 misregulation and NPTX2 accumulation, thereby highlighting a new pathway of neurotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Directional Tuning of Phase Precession Properties in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Running direction in the hippocampus is encoded by rate modulations of place field activity but also by spike timing correlations known as theta sequences. Whether directional rate codes and the directionality of place field correlations are related, however, has so far not been explored and therefore the nature of how directional information is encoded in the cornu ammonis remains unresolved. Here, using a previously published dataset that contains the spike activity of rat hippocampal place cells in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subregions during free foraging of male Long-Evans rats in a 2D environment, we found that rate and spike timing codes are related. Opposite to a place field's preferred firing rate direction spikes are more likely to undergo theta phase precession and, hence, more strongly impact paired correlations. Furthermore, we identified a subset of field pairs whose theta correlations are intrinsic in that they maintain the same firing order when the running direction is reversed. Both effects are associated with differences in theta phase distributions, and are more prominent in CA3 than CA1. We thus hypothesize that intrinsic spiking is most prominent when the directionally modulated sensory-motor drive of hippocampal firing rates is minimal, suggesting that extrinsic and intrinsic sequences contribute to phase precession as two distinct mechanisms.

                The neural mechanisms of visual conscious perception have been investigated for decades. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics associated with the earliest neural responses following consciously perceived stimuli are still poorly understood. Using a dataset of intracranial EEG recordings, the current study aims to investigate the neural activity changes associated with the earliest stages of visual conscious perception. Subjects (N=10, 1,693 grey matter electrode contacts) completed a continuous performance task in which individual letters were presented in series and subjects were asked to press a button when they saw a target letter. Broadband gamma power (40-115Hz) dynamics were analyzed in comparison to baseline prior to stimulus and contrasted for target trials with button presses and non-target trials without button presses. Regardless of event type, we observed early gamma power changes within 30-150 ms from stimulus onset in a network including increases in bilateral occipital, fusiform, frontal (including frontal eye fields), and medial temporal cortex, increases in left lateral parietal-temporal cortex, and decreases in the right anterior medial occipital cortex. No significant differences were observed between target and non-target stimuli until >150 ms post-stimulus, when we saw greater gamma power increases in left motor and premotor areas, suggesting a possible role of these later signals in perceptual decision making and/or motor responses with the right hand. The early gamma power findings suggest a broadly distributed cortical visual detection network that is engaged at early times tens of milliseconds after signal transduction from the retina.

                Bayesian models of autism suggest that disruptions in context-sensitive prediction error weighting may underpin sensory perceptual alterations, such as hypersensitivities. We used an auditory oddball paradigm with pure tones arising from high or low uncertainity contexts to determine whether autistic individuals display differences in context adjustment relative to neurotypicals. We did not find group differences in early prediction error responses indexed by mismatch negativity. However, the autism group had larger evoked responses to outliers, at 300ms latency suggesting a greater reorienting of attention to surprising sounds. A dimensional approach revealed a positive correlation between context-dependent prediction errors and auditory sensitivities, but not with autistic traits. These findings suggest that autism studies may benefit from accounting for sensory sensitivities in group comparisons.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer enclosed structures that not only represent a newly discovered means for cell-to-cell communication but may also serve as promising disease biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Apart from proteins, lipids, and metabolites, EVs can deliver genetic information such as mRNA eliciting a response in the recipient cells. In the present study, we have analyzed the mRNA content of brain-derived EVs (BDEVs) isolated 72 hours after experimental stroke in mice and compared them to controls (shams) using the nCounter(R) Nanostring panels, with or without prior RNA isolation from BDEVs. We found that both panels show similar results when comparing upregulated mRNA in stroke. Notably, the higher upregulated mRNAs were related to processes of stress and immune system responses, but also to anatomical structure development, cell differentiation, and extracellular matrix organization, indicating that regenerative mechanisms are already taking place at this time-point. The five top overexpressed mRNAs in stroke mice compared to shams were confirmed by RT-qPCR and, interestingly, were found to be present as full-length open-reading frame in BDEVs. We could reveal that the majority of the mRNA cargo in BDEVs was of microglial origin and probably predominantly present in small BDEVs ([&le;]200 nm in diameter). However, the EV population with the highest increase in the total BDEVs pool at 72 h after stroke was of oligodendrocytic origin. Our study shows that nCounter(R) panels are a good tool to study mRNA content in tissue-derived EVs as they can be carried out even without previous mRNA isolation and that the mRNA cargo of BDEVs indicates their participation in inflammatory but also recovery processes after stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel and known transcriptional targets of ALS/FTD protein TDP-43: Meta-analysis and interactive graphical databases</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathy is the major pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mounting evidence implicates a loss of normal TDP-43 function in neurodegeneration, either resultant from or independent of TDP-43 aggregation. TDP-43 knockdown is therefore a common paradigm for modelling ALS and FTD. However, because TDP-43 can interact directly with thousands of mRNA targets and regulate the function of other RNA binding proteins, the phenotype of TDP-43 depletion is likely to differ depending on the proteomic and transcriptomic profile of the model cell type. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets that utilized TDP-43 knockdown to model ALS or FTD, and validated these against RNA-sequencing data from TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei from ALS/FTD brain. We present these analyses as easy-to-use interactive graphical databases. Of 9 TDP-43-knockdown datasets identified, 4 showed significant depletion of TARDBP (human HeLa and SH-SY5Y cell lines, induced human motor neurons, and mouse striatal tissue). There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between TDP-43-knockdown model cell types, but PFKP, RANBP1, KIAA1324, ELAVL3, and STMN2 were among the common TDP-43 targets. Of these, only STMN2 was validated as a differentially expressed gene in TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei in ALS/FTD brain. Similarly, there were few genes that showed common patterns of differential exon usage between cell types and which validated in TDP-43-immunonegative neurons, but these included well-known targets POLDIP3, RANBP1, STMN2, and UNC13A, and novel targets EXD3, CEP290, KPNA4, and MMAB. Enrichment analysis showed that TDP-43 knockdown in different cell types affected a unique range of biological pathways. Together, these data identify novel TDP-43 targets, validate known TDP-43 targets, and show that TDP-43 plays both conserved and cell-type-specific roles in the regulation of gene expression and splicing. Identification of cell-type-specific TDP-43 targets will enable sensitive mapping of cell-autonomous TDP-43 dysfunction beyond just neurons, while shared TDP-43 targets are likely to have therapeutic value across myriad cell types.

                2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in the brain, regulates diverse neural functions. However, whether 2-AG deficiency contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) and nigral dopaminergic neurons (DANs) dysfunction is unclear. Diacylglycerol lipase A and B (DAGLA and DAGLB) mediate the biosynthesis of 2-AG. Using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we linked multiple homozygous loss-of-function mutations in DAGLB to a form of early-onset autosomal recessive PD. We then used RNA sequencing and fiber photometry with genetically encoded eCB sensors to demonstrate that DAGLB is the main 2-AG synthase in nigral DANs. Genetic knockdown of Daglb by CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse nigral DANs substantially reduces 2-AG levels in the substantia nigra (SN). The SN 2-AG levels are markedly correlated with the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills, while Daglb-deficiency impairs motor learning. Conversely, pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG levels increases nigral DAN activity and dopamine release and improves motor learning. Together, we demonstrate that DAGLB-deficiency contributes to the etiopathogenesis of PD, reveal the importance of DAGLB-mediated 2-AG biosynthesis in nigral DANs in regulating neural activity and dopamine release, and provide preclinical evidence for the beneficial effects of 2-AG augmentation in PD treatment.

                Dopamine facilitates approach to reward via its actions on dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens. For example, blocking either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors in the accumbens reduces the proportion of reward-predictive cues to which rats respond with cued approach. Recent evidence indicates that accumbens dopamine also promotes wakefulness and arousal, but the relationship between dopamine's roles in arousal and reward seeking remains unexplored. Here, we show that the ability of systemic or intra-accumbens injections of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 to reduce cued approach to reward depends on the animal's state of arousal. Handling the animal, a manipulation known to increase arousal, was sufficient to reverse the behavioral effects of the antagonist. In addition, SCH23390 reduced spontaneous locomotion and increased time spent in sleep postures, both consistent with reduced arousal, but also increased time spent immobile in postures inconsistent with sleep. In contrast, the ability of the D2 antagonist haloperidol to reduce cued approach was not reversible by handling. Haloperidol reduced spontaneous locomotion but did not increase sleep postures, instead increasing immobility in non-sleep postures. We place these results in the context of the extensive literature on dopamine's contributions to behavior, and propose the arousal-motor hypothesis, a novel synthesis that accounts both for our findings and many previous results that have drawn disparate and conflicting conclusions.

                Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signaling is essential for the actions of classical psychedelic drugs. In this study, we examined whether random sequence variations in the gene (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) encoding the 5-HT2AR affect the signaling of four commonly used psychedelic drugs. We examined the in vitro pharmacology of seven non-synonymous SNPs, which give rise to S12N, T25N, D48N, I197V, A230T, A447V, and H452Y variant 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. We found that these non-synonymous SNPs exert statistically significant, although modest, effects on the efficacy and potency of four therapeutically relevant hallucinogens. Significantly, the in vitro pharmacological effects of the SNPs drug actions at 5-HT2AR are drug specific.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Escape Steering by Cholecystokinin Peptidergic Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Escape is an evolutionarily conserved and essential avoidance response. Considered to be innate, most studies on escape responses focused on hard-wired circuits. We report here that peptidergic signaling is an integral and necessary component of the Caenorhabditis elegans escape circuit. Combining genetic screening, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we reveal that a neuropeptide NLP-18 and its cholecystokinin receptor CKR-1 enable the escape circuit to execute a full omega turn, the last motor step where the animal robustly steers away from its original trajectory. We demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that CKR-1 is a Gq protein-coupled receptor for NLP-18. in vivo, NLP-18 is mainly secreted by the gustatory sensory neuron (ASI) to activate CKR-1 in the head motor neuron (SMD) and the turn-initiating interneuron (AIB). Removal of NLP-18, removal of CKR-1, or specific knockdown of CKR-1 in SMD or AIB neurons lead to shallower turns hence less robust escape steering. Consistently, the Ca2+ transients elevation of head motor neuron SMD during escape steering is attenuated upon the removal of NLP-18 or CKR-1. in vitro, synthetic NLP-18 directly evokes CKR-1-dependent currents in oocytes and CKR-1-dependent Ca2+ transients in SMD. Thus, cholecystokinin signaling modulates an escape circuit to generate robust escape steering.

                During fear learning, defensive behaviors need to be finely balanced, to allow animals to return to normal behaviors after the termination of threat-indicating sensory cues. Nevertheless, the circuits underlying such balancing are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of direct (D1R+) - and indirect (Adora+) pathway neurons of the amygdala-striatal transition zone (AStria) in fear learning. In-vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that fear learning increased the responses of D1R+ AStria neurons to an auditory CS, given that the animal moved. In Adora+ neurons, fear learning also induced a differential activity during freezing and movement, albeit with little influence of the CS. In-vivo optogenetic silencing during the training day showed that plasticity in D1R+ AStria neurons contributes to auditory-cued fear memories, whereas Adora+ neurons suppressed learned freezing when no CS was present. Circuit tracing experiments identified cortical input structures to the AStria, and recording of optogenetically-evoked EPSCs at the corresponding projection revealed different forms of long-term plasticity at synapses onto D1R+ and Adora+ AStria neurons. Taken together, direct- and indirect pathways neurons of the AStria show differential signs of in-vivo and ex-vivo plasticity after fear learning, and balance defensive behaviors in the presence and absence of aversively motivated sensory cues.

                Female sexual behavior as an innate behavior is of prominent biological importance for survival and reproduction. However, molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior is not well understood. Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) promotes female sexual behavior in Drosophila. Manipulation both Dsk and DSK neuronal activity impact female sexual receptivity. In addition, we reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons receive input signal from R71G01GAL4 neurons to promote female sexual receptivity. Based on intersectional technique, we further found the regulation of female sexual behavior relies mainly on medial DSK neurons rather than lateral DSK neurons, and medial DSK neurons modulate female sexual behavior by acting on its receptor CCKLR-17D3. Thus, we characterized DSK/CCKLR-17D3 as R71G01GAL4 neurons downstream signaling to regulate female sexual behavior.

                Gustatory sensory neurons detect caloric and harmful compounds in potential food and convey this information to the brain to inform feeding decisions. To examine the signals that gustatory neurons transmit and receive, we reconstructed gustatory axons and their synaptic sites in the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain, utilizing a whole-brain electron microscopy volume. We reconstructed 87 gustatory projections from the proboscis labellum in the right hemisphere and 57 in the left, representing the majority of labellar gustatory axons. Morphology- and connectivity-based clustering revealed six distinct clusters, likely representing neurons recognizing different taste modalities. Gustatory neurons contain a nearly equal number of interspersed pre-and post-synaptic sites, with extensive synaptic connectivity among gustatory axons. The vast majority of synaptic connections are between morphologically similar neurons, although connections also exist between distinct neuronal subpopulations. This study resolves the anatomy of labellar gustatory projections, reveals that gustatory projections are likely segregated based on taste modality, and uncovers synaptic connections that may alter the transmission of gustatory signals.

                Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and relapse during abstinence remains the key barrier to successful treatment of tobacco addiction. During abstinence, environmental contexts associated with nicotine use can induce craving and contribute to relapse. The insular cortex (IC) is thought to be a critical substrate of nicotine addiction and relapse. However, its specific role in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking is not fully known. In this study, we report a novel rodent model of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence, which models self-imposed abstinence through increasing negative consequences of excessive drug use. Using the neuronal activity marker Fos we find that the anterior (aIC), but not the middle or posterior IC, shows increased activity during context-induced relapse. Combining Fos with retrograde labelling of aIC inputs, we show projections to aIC from contralateral aIC and basolateral amygdala exhibit increased activity during context-induced relapse. Next, we used fiber photometry in aIC and observed phasic increases in aIC activity around nicotine-seeking responses during self-administration, punishment, and the context-induced relapse tests. Next, we used chemogenetic inhibition in both male and female rats to determine whether activity in aIC is necessary for context-induced relapse. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced nicotine-seeking after either punishment- or extinction-imposed abstinence. These findings highlight the critical role nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that aIC activity is critical for this context-induced relapse following both punishment and extinction imposed abstinence.

                Extensive serotonin (5-HT) innervation throughout the brain corroborates 5-HTs modulatory role in numerous cognitive activities. Volume transmission is the major mode for 5-HT transmission but mechanisms underlying 5-HT signaling are still largely unknown. Abnormal brain 5-HT levels and function have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurexin (Nrxn) genes encode presynaptic cell adhesion molecules important for the regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release, notably glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. Mutations in Nrxn genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. However, the role of Nrxn genes in the 5-HT system is poorly understood. Here, we generated a mouse model with all three Nrxn genes disrupted specifically in 5-HT neurons to study how Nrxns affect 5-HT transmission. Loss of Nrxns in 5-HT neurons impaired 5-HT release in the dorsal raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus and decreased serotonin transporter distribution in specific brain areas. Furthermore, 5-HT neuron-specific Nrxn knockout reduced sociability and increased depressive-like behavior. Our results highlight functional roles for Nrxns in 5-HT neurotransmission and the execution of complex behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stress-impaired reward pathway promotes distinct feeding behavior patterns</a></h4>

              
                Psychosocial stress can impact feeding behavior outcomes. Although many studies have examined alterations to food intake, little is known about how stress affects feeding behavior patterns. To determine the impact of psychological stress on feeding behavior patterns, mice were subjected to various psychosocial stressors (social isolation, intermittent high-fat-diet, or physical restraint) prior to timed observations in a feeding arena that incorporated multiple bait loci. In addition, in vivo microdialysis was used to assess the effects of stressors on the reward system by measuring dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) shell. Impaired feeding behavior patterns characterized by significant deviations in bait selection (i.e. fixated feeding) and prolonged periods of eating (i.e. protracted feeding) were observed in stressed mice relative to non-stressed controls. In addition to clear behavioral effects, the stressors also negatively impacted dopamine levels at the nucleus accumbens shell. Normalization of dopamine reversed the fixated feeding behavior, whereas specifically inhibiting neuronal activity in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area that project to the nucleus accumbens shell caused similar impairments in feeding. Given that the deviations were not consistently accompanied by changes in the amount of bait consumed, body weight, or metabolic factors, the qualitative effects of psychosocial stressors on feeding behavior likely reflect perturbations to a critical pathway in the mesolimbic dopamine system. These findings provide compelling evidence that aberrations in feeding behavior patterns can be developed as sensitive biomarkers of psychosocial stress and possibly a prodromal state of neuropsychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Speed Low-Light In Vivo Two-Photon Voltage Imaging of Large Neuronal Populations</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring spiking activity across large neuronal populations at behaviorally relevant timescales is critical for understanding neural circuit function. Unlike calcium imaging, voltage imaging requires kilohertz sampling rates which reduces fluorescence detection to near shot noise levels. High-photon flux excitation can overcome photon-limited shot noise but photo-bleaching and photo-damage restricts the number and duration of simultaneously imaged neurons. We investigated an alternative approach aimed at low two-photon flux, voltage imaging below the shot noise limit. This framework involved developing: a positive-going voltage indicator with improved spike detection (SpikeyGi); an ultra-fast two-photon microscope for kilohertz frame-rate imaging across a 0.4x0.4mm2 field of view, and; a self-supervised denoising algorithm (DeepVID) for inferring fluorescence from shot-noise limited signals. Through these combined advances, we achieved simultaneous high-speed, deep-tissue imaging of more than one hundred densely-labeled neurons over one hour in awake behaving mice. This demonstrates a scalable approach for voltage imaging across increasing neuronal populations.

                Sleep inertia is the brief period of impaired alertness and performance experienced immediately after waking. While the neurobehavioral symptoms of sleep inertia are well-described, less is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A better understanding of the neural processes during sleep inertia may offer insight into the cognitive impairments observed and the awakening process generally. We observed brain activity following abrupt awakening from slow wave sleep during the biological night. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and a network science approach, we evaluated power, clustering coefficient, and path length across frequency bands under both a control condition and a blue-enriched light intervention condition in a within-subject design. We found that under control conditions, the awakening brain is typified by an immediate reduction in global theta, alpha, and beta power. Simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the clustering coefficient and an increase in path length within the delta band. Exposure to blue-enriched light immediately after awakening ameliorated these changes, but only for clustering. Our results suggest that long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the waking process and that the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. Our study highlights a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain and provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the effect of light in improving performance after waking.

                Central nervous system macroglia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are required for normal brain development and function, and are among the last cells to emerge during neurodevelopment. Many questions remain about their emergence in the brain and spinal cord, including how early glial fates are specified during development or differen- tiation, and similarly when subtypes of glia are specified. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze ~90,000 cells across multiple timepoints during the differentiation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. Using time series analysis of gene expres- sion, we uncovered multiple genes involved in fate specification of glial subtypes in both species. We examined gene expression changes during intermediate states of glial specification, and were able to identify genes that were correlated with the choice between neuron versus glia in both species. Using our scRNAseq data we optimized previous mouse astrocyte differentiation protocols by highlighting and removing non-required transition states and decreasing the overall protocol from 3 weeks to less than 12 days. Our data will be useful for researchers interested in optimizing glial differentiations in either species, and provide a window into human glial differentiation, which is difficult to study given its lateness in development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recut: a Concurrent Framework for Sparse Reconstruction of Neuronal Morphology</a></h4>

              
                Interpreting the influx of microscopy and neuroimaging data is bottlenecked by neuronal reconstruction's long-standing issues in accuracy, automation, and scalability. Rapidly increasing data size is particularly concerning for modern computing infrastructure due to the wall in memory bandwidth which historically has witnessed the slowest rate of technological advancement. Recut is an end to end reconstruction pipeline that takes raw large-volume light microscopy images and yields filtered or tuned automated neuronal reconstructions that require minimal proofreading and no other manual intervention. By leveraging adaptive grids and other methods, Recut also has a unified data representation with up to a 509x reduction in memory footprint resulting in an 89.5x throughput increase and enabling an effective 64x increase in the scale of volumes that can be skeletonized on servers or resource limited devices. Recut also employs coarse and fine-grained parallelism to achieve speedup factors beyond CPU core count in sparse settings when compared to the current fastest reconstruction method. By leveraging the sparsity in light microscopy datasets, this can allow full brains to be processed in-memory, a property which may significantly shift the compute needs of the neuroimaging community. The scale and speed of Recut fundamentally changes the reconstruction process, allowing an interactive yet deeply automated workflow.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-monotonic effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs on neuronal firing</a></h4>

              
                GABA is canonically known as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, usually acting by hyper-polarizing membrane potential. However, GABAergic currents can also exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that the relationship between GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibits three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, {nu}GABA: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low {nu}GABA (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for {nu}GABA above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of {nu}GABA. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of {nu}GABA for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.

                Surrounding context influences speech listening, resulting in dynamic shifts to category percepts. To examine its neural basis, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during vowel identification with continua presented in random, forward, and backward orders to induce perceptual nonlinearities. Behaviorally, sequential order shifted listeners' categorical boundary vs. random delivery revealing perceptual warping (biasing) of the heard phonetic category dependent on recent stimulus history. ERPs revealed later (~300 ms) activity localized to superior temporal and middle/inferior frontal gyri that predicted listeners' hysteresis magnitudes. Findings demonstrate that top-down, stimulus history effects on speech categorization are governed by interactions between frontotemporal brain regions.

                There are multiple levels of processing relevant to reading that vary in their visual, sublexical and lexical orthographic processing demands. Segregating distinct cortical sources for each of these levels has been challenging in EEG studies of early readers. To address this challenge, we applied recent advances in analyzing high-density EEG using Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) via data-driven Reliable Components Analysis (RCA) in a group of early readers spanning from kindergarten to second grade. Three controlled stimulus contrasts---familiar words versus unfamiliar pseudofonts, familiar words versus orthographically legal pseudowords, and orthographically legal pseudowords versus orthographically illegal nonwords---were used to isolate visual print/letter selectivity, sublexical processing, and lexical processing, respectively. We found robust responses specific to each of these processing levels, even in kindergarteners who have limited knowledge of print. Moreover, comparing amplitudes of these three stimulus contrasts across three reading fluency-based groups and three grade-based groups revealed fluency group and grade group main effects only for lexical contrast (i.e., words versus orthographically legal pseudowords). Furthermore, we found that sublexical orthography-related responses shifted their topographic distribution from the right to left hemisphere from kindergarten to first and second grades. Results suggest that, with more sensitive measures, the sublexical and lexical fine tuning for words---as a bio-marker of reading ability---can be detected at a much earlier stage than previously assumed.

                Diet induced obesity is one of the major causes of obesity, which affects 13% of the world's adult population. Obesity is correlated to chronic pain regardless of other components of the metabolic syndrome. Our study focuses on investigating the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity on peripheral sensory neurons activity and pain perception, followed by deciphering the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that involve Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 3 (ASIC3). We show here that heat sensitive C-fibers from mice made obese by consumption of a high-fat diet exhibited an increased activity during baseline and upon heating. Obese mice showed long-lasting heat pain hypersensitivity once obesity was well established, while mechanical sensitivity was not affected. We found that the serum of obese mice was enriched in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species (LPC16:0, LPC18:0 and LPC18:1), which activate ASIC3 channels and increased peripheral neuron excitability. Genetic deletion and in vivo pharmacological inhibition of ASIC3 protected and rescued mice from obesity-induced thermal hypersensitivity. Our results identify ASIC3 channels in DRG neurons and circulating LPC species that activate them as a mechanism contributing to heat pain hypersensitivity associated with high-fat diet induced obesity.

                Since their development, social media has grown as a source of information and has a significant impact on opinion formation. Individuals interact with others and content via social media platforms in a variety of ways but it remains unclear how decision making and associated neural processes are impacted by the online sharing of informational content, from factual to fabricated. Here, we use EEG to estimate dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks and probe the neural changes underlying opinion change (or formation) within individuals interacting with a simulated social media platform. Our findings indicate that the individuals who show more malleable opinions are characterized by less frequent network reconfigurations while those with more rigid opinions tend to have more flexible brain networks with frequent reconfigurations. The nature of these frequent network configurations suggests a fundamentally different thought process between the individuals who are more easily influenced by social media and those who are not. We also show that these reconfigurations are distinct to the brain dynamics during an in-person discussion with strangers on the same content. Together, these findings suggest that network reconfigurations in the brain may not only be diagnostic to the informational context but also the underlie opinion formation.

                Neural oscillatory activities in basal ganglia have prominent roles in cognitive processes on local and global scales. However, the characteristics of high frequency oscillatory activities during cognitive tasks have not been extensively explored in human Globus Pallidus internus (GPi). This study aimed to investigate amplitude and interhemispheric coupling of bilateral GPi high gamma bursts in dystonia and Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, in on and off medication states, after feedback during the Intra-Extra-Dimension shift (IED) task. Bilateral GPi Local Field Potentials (LFP) activity was recorded via externalized DBS electrodes during the IED task. Inter hemisphere phase synchrony was assessed using Inter-Site Phase Clustering (ISPC). Transient high gamma activity (~100-150Hz) was observed immediately after feedback in the dystonia patient. Moreover, these bursts were phase synchronous between left and right GPis with an antiphase clustering of phase differences. In contrast, no synchronous high gamma activity was detected in the PD patient with or without dopamine administration. The off-med PD patient displayed enhanced low frequency clusters ameliorated by medication in the on-med state. Furthermore, an increased low frequency activity was observed after feedback of incorrect trials in both disease states. The current study provides a rare report of antiphase homotopic synchrony in human GPi, potentially related to incorporating and processing feedback information. The absence of these activities in off and on-med PD indicates the potential presence of impaired medication independent circuits related to feedback processing. Together, these findings are helpful in pointing to the potential role of GPi's synchronized high frequency activity in cognitive tasks and feedback information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transparent and Conformal Microcoil Arrays for Spatially Selective Neuronal Activation</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic stimulation represents a compelling modality for achieving neuronal activation with high spatial resolution and low toxicity. Stimulation coils can be designed to achieve localized, spatially asymmetric fields that target neurons of a particular orientation. Furthermore, these devices may be encapsulated within biopolymers thereby avoiding direct metal/tissue interfaces that could induce chronic inflammation and glial scarring. Herein, we report a multiplexed microcoil array for localized activation of cortical neurons and retinal ganglion cells. We designed a computational model that related the activation function to the geometry and arrangement of coils, and selected a geometry with a region of activation <50 microns wide. We then fabricated SU8/Cu/SU8 tri-layer devices which were flexible, transparent and conformal and featured four individually-addressable microcoil stimulation elements. Interfaced with ex vivo cortex or retina slices from GCaMP6-transfected mice, we observed that individual neurons located within 40 microns of the element tip could be activated repeatedly and in a dose (power) dependent fashion. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of magnetic stimulation devices for brain-machine interfaces and could open new routes toward bioelectronic therapies including prosthetic vision devices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endogenous Syngap1 Alpha Splice Forms Promote Cognitive Function and Seizure Protection</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function variants in SYNAGP1 cause a developmental encephalopathy defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy. SYNAGP1 splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts pleiotropic cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function in vivo to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of 1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing 1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with 1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP- expression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Spatial Reach of Neuronal Coherence and Spike-field Coupling across the Human Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal coherence is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of communication in the brain, where synchronized field potentials coordinate synaptic and spiking events to support plasticity and learning. Although the spread of field potentials has garnered great interest, little is known about the spatial reach of phase synchronization, or neuronal coherence. Functional connectivity between different brain regions is known to occur across long distances, but the locality of coherence within a brain region is understudied. Here we used simultaneous recordings from electrocorticography (ECoG) grids and high-density microelectrode arrays to estimate the spatial reach of neuronal coherence and spike-field coherence (SFC) across frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices during cognitive tasks in humans. We observed the strongest coherence within a 2-3 cm distance from the microelectrode arrays, potentially defining an effective range for local communication. This range was relatively consistent across brain regions, spectral frequencies, and cognitive tasks. The magnitude of coherence showed power law decay with increasing distance from the microelectrode arrays, where the highest coherence occurred between ECoG contacts, followed by coherence between ECoG and deep cortical LFP, and then SFC (i.e., ECoG > LFP > SFC). The spectral frequency of coherence also affected its magnitude. Alpha coherence (8-14 Hz) was generally higher than other frequencies for signals nearest the microelectrode arrays, whereas delta coherence (1-3 Hz) was higher for signals that were farther away. Action potentials in all brain regions were most coherent with the phase of alpha oscillations, which suggests that alpha waves could play a larger, more spatially local role in spike timing than other frequencies. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the spatial and spectral dynamics of neuronal coherence, further advancing knowledge about how activity propagates across the human brain.

	<p>Aggressive behavior is modulated by many factors, including personality and cognition, as well as endocrine and neural changes. To study the potential effects on the reaction to provocation, which was realized by an ostensible opponent subtracting money from the participant, we administered testosterone (T) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) or a respective placebo (PL). Forty males underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging session while performing a provocation paradigm. We investigated differential hormone effects and the potential influence of Machiavellian traits on punishment choices (monetary subtractions by the participant) in the paradigm. Participants in the T/AVP group subtracted more money when they were not provoked but showed increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule during feedback compared to PL. Higher Machiavellian traits significantly increased punishing behavior independent of provocation only in this group. The pilot study shows that T/AVP affects neural and behavioral responses during a provocation paradigm while personality characteristics, such as Machiavellian trait patterns, specifically interact with hormonal influences (T/AVP) and their effects on behavior.</p>

	<p>Nasal breathing is a dynamic cortical organizer involved in various behaviors and states, such as locomotion, exploration, memory, emotion, introspection. However, the effect of sensory deprivation of nasal respiratory breath (NRD) on behavior remain poorly understood. Herein, general locomotor activity, emotion, learning and memory, social interaction, and mechanical pain were evaluated using a zinc sulfate nasal irrigation induced nasal respiratory sensory deprivation animal model (ZnSO4-induced mouse model). In the open field test, the elevated O-maze test, and forced swim test, NRD mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. In memory-associated tests, NRD mice showed cognitive impairments in the hippocampal-dependent memory (Y maze, object recognition task, and contextual fear conditioning (CFC)) and amygdala-dependent memory (the tone-cued fear conditioning test (TFC)). Surprisingly, NRD mice did not display deficits in the acquisition of conditional fear in both CFC and TFC tests. Still, they showed significant memory retrieval impairment in TFC and enhanced memory retrieval in CFC. At the same time, in the social novelty test using a three-chamber setting, NRD mice showed impaired social and social novelty behavior. Lastly, in the von Frey filaments test, we found that the pain sensitivity of NRD mice was reduced. In conclusion, this NRD mouse model showed a variety of behavioral phenotypic changes, which could offer an important insight into the behavioral impacts of patients with anosmia or those with an impaired olfactory bulb (OB) (e.g., in COVID-19, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, etc.).</p>

	<p>Purpose: the evaluation of body image perception, pain coping strategies, and dream content, together with phantom limb and telescoping phenomena in patients with sarcoma who underwent surgery for limb amputation. Material and Methods: consecutive outpatients were evaluated at T0 (within 3 weeks after surgery) and T1 (4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months after surgery) as follows: demographic and clinical data collection; the Groningen Questionnaire Problems after Arm Amputation; the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory; the Body Image Concern Inventory, a clinical trial to identify telescoping; and a weekly diary of dreams. Dream contents were coded according to the Hall and Van de Castle coding system. Results: Twenty patients completed the study (15 males and 5 females, mean age: 53.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 24.6, education: 7.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.4). All subjects experienced phantom limb and 35% of them experienced telescoping soon after surgery, and 25% still after 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months. Both at T0 and T1, that half of the subjects reported dreams about still having their missing limbs. At T1 the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; perceptions of being able to deal with problems were lower, and pain and its interference in everyday life were higher yet associated with significant engagement in everyday activities and an overall good mood. The dream content analysis highlighted that males were less worried about health problems soon after amputation, and women showed more initial difficulties that seemed to be resolved after 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months after surgery. Conclusions: The dream content analysis may improve clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to support their patients during their therapeutic course.</p>

	<p>Liver damage can lead to secondary organ damage by toxic substances and catabolic products accumulation which can increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier, leading to cognitive impairment. The only real treatment for end stage liver failure is grafting. With some, but not all, neurological symptoms subsiding after transplantation, the presence of brain damage can impair both the short and long-term outcome. We tested if Cerebrolysin can prevent brain injury in an experimental model of non-viral liver damage in mice. Behavior, abdominal ultrasound evaluation and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the animals. No ultrasound or behavior differences were found between the control and treated animals, with both groups displaying more anxiety and no short-term memory benefit compared to sham mice. Cerebrolysin treatment was able to maintain a normal level of cortical NeuN+ cells and induced an increase in the area occupied by BrdU+ cells. Surprisingly, no difference was observed when investigating Iba1+ cells. With neurological complications of end-stage liver disease impacting the rehabilitation of patients receiving liver grafts, a neuroprotective treatment of patients on the waiting lists might improve their rehabilitation outcome by ensuring a minimal cerebral damage.</p>

	<p>After reviewing seminal studies using optogenetics to interrogate the functional role of the locus coeruleus in behavior, we conclude that differences in firing rates and firing patterns of locus coeruleus neurons contribute to locus coeruleus nucleus heterogeneity by recruiting different output circuitry, and differentially modifying behavior. The outcomes initiated by different optogenetic input activation patterns and frequencies can have opposite consequences for behavior, activate different neurons in the same target structure, be supported by distinct adrenoceptors and vary with behavioral state.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many receptive fields in the early visual system show standard (center-surround) structure and can be analyzed using simple drifting patterns and a difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) model, which treats the receptive field as a linear filter of the visual image. But many other receptive fields show nonlinear properties such as selectivity for direction of movement. Such receptive fields are typically studied using discrete stimuli (moving or flashed bars and edges) and are modelled according to the features of the visual image to which they are most sensitive. Here, we harness recent advances in tomographic image analysis to characterize rapidly and simultaneously both the linear and nonlinear components of visual receptive fields. Spiking and intracellular voltage potential responses to briefly flashed bars are analyzed using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and iterative reconstruction tomography (IRT). The method yields high-resolution receptive field maps of individual neurons and neuron ensembles in primate (marmoset, both sexes) lateral geniculate and rodent (mouse, male) retina. We show that the first two IRT components correspond to DoG-equivalent center and surround of standard [magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P)] receptive fields in primate geniculate. The first two IRT components also reveal the spatiotemporal receptive field structure of nonstandard (on/off-rectifying) receptive fields. In rodent retina we combine NNMF-IRT with patch-clamp recording and dye injection to directly map spatial receptive fields to the underlying anatomy of retinal output neurons. We conclude that NNMF-IRT provides a rapid and flexible framework for study of receptive fields in the early visual system.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Untreated age-related hearing loss increases audiovisual integration and impacts resting state functional brain connectivity. Further, there is a relation between crossmodal plasticity and audiovisual integration strength in cochlear implant patients. However, it is currently unclear whether amplification of the auditory input by hearing aids influences audiovisual integration and resting state functional brain connectivity. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study to investigate how the McGurk illusion, a common measure for audiovisual integration, and resting state functional brain connectivity of the auditory cortex are altered by six-month hearing aid use. Thirty-two older participants with slight-to-moderate, symmetric, age-related hearing loss were allocated to a treatment or waiting control group and measured one week before and six months after hearing aid fitting with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results showed a statistical trend for an increased McGurk illusion after six months of hearing aid use. We further demonstrated that an increase in McGurk susceptibility is related to a decreased hearing aid benefit for auditory speech intelligibility in noise. No significant interaction between group and time point was obtained in the whole-brain resting state analysis. However, a region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis indicated that hearing aid use of six months was associated with a decrease in resting state functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and the fusiform gyrus and that this decrease was related to an increase of perceived McGurk illusions. Our study, therefore, suggests that even short-term hearing aid use alters audiovisual integration and functional brain connectivity between auditory and visual cortices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amyloidogenic Processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein Drives Stretch-Induced Disruption of Axonal Transport in hiPSC-Derived Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in disrupted brain function following impact from an external force and is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although neurologic symptoms triggered by mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI), the most common form of TBI, typically resolve rapidly, even an isolated mTBI event can increase the risk to develop AD. Aberrant accumulation of amyloid &beta; peptide (A&beta;), a cleaved fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a key pathologic outcome designating the progression of AD following mTBI and has also been linked to impaired axonal transport. However, relationships among mTBI, amyloidogenesis, and axonal transport remain unclear, in part because of the dearth of human models to study the neuronal response following mTBI. Here, we implemented a custom-microfabricated device to deform neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from a cognitively unimpaired male individual, to mimic the mild stretch experienced by neurons during mTBI. Although no cell lethality or cytoskeletal disruptions were observed, mild stretch was sufficient to stimulate rapid amyloidogenic processing of APP. This processing led to abrupt cessation of APP axonal transport and progressive formation of aberrant axonal accumulations that contained APP, its processing machinery, and amyloidogenic fragments. Consistent with this sequence of events, stretch-induced defects were abrogated by reducing amyloidogenesis either pharmacologically or genetically. In sum, we have uncovered a novel and manipulable stretch-induced amyloidogenic pathway directly responsible for APP axonal transport dysregulation. Our findings may help to understand and ultimately mitigate the risk of developing AD following mTBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mild traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased amyloid &beta; peptide generation after injury may drive this risk. Here, by using a custom-built device to impose mild stretch to human neurons, we found that stretch triggers amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, and thus amyloid &beta; peptide generation, consequently disrupting APP axonal transport. Compellingly, protecting APP from cleavage was sufficient to spare axonal transport dysregulation and the consequent aberrant axonal accumulation of APP. Supporting such protective mechanism, the expression of the AD-protective APP<sup>A673T</sup> genetic variant conferred protection against stretch-induced APP axonal transport phenotypes. Our data reveal potential subcellular pathways contributing to the development of AD-associated phenotypes following mild traumatic brain injury, and putative strategies for intervening in these pathways.</p>

                <p>Inflammatory cells, including macrophages and microglia, synthesize and release the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which has antiviral and immunomodulatory properties. Here, we examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an activator of innate immunity, on 25HC production in microglia, and the effects of LPS and 25HC on CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning. In primary microglia, LPS markedly increases the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), the key enzyme involved in 25HC synthesis, and increases the levels of secreted 25HC. Wild-type microglia produced higher levels of 25HC than <I>Ch25h</I> knock-out (KO) microglia with or without LPS. LPS treatment also disrupts long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices via induction of a form of NMDA receptor-dependent metaplasticity. The inhibitory effects of LPS on LTP were mimicked by exogenous 25HC, and were not observed in slices from <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. <I>In vivo</I>, LPS treatment also disrupts LTP and inhibits one-trial learning in wild-type mice, but not <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. These results demonstrate that the oxysterol 25HC is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity and memory under proinflammatory stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to cognitive impairment in multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. In this study, we found that a proinflammatory stimulus, LPS, disrupts hippocampal LTP via a metaplastic mechanism. The effects of LPS on LTP are mimicked by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an immune mediator synthesized in brain microglia. Effects of LPS on both synaptic plasticity and one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning are eliminated in mice deficient in Ch25h (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase), the primary enzyme responsible for endogenous 25HC synthesis. Thus, these results indicate that 25HC is a key mediator of the effects of an inflammatory stimulus on hippocampal function and open new potential avenues to overcome the effects of neuroinflammation on brain function.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the developing visual cortex undergo progressive functional maturation as indicated by the refinement of their visual feature selectivity. However, changes of the synaptic architecture underlying the maturation of spatial visual receptive fields (RFs) per se remain largely unclear. Here, loose-patch as well as single-unit recordings in layer 4 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) of both sexes revealed that RF development following an eye-opening period is marked by an increased proportion of cortical neurons with spatially defined RFs, together with the increased signal-to-noise ratio of spiking responses. By exploring excitatory and inhibitory synaptic RFs with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed a balanced enhancement of both synaptic excitation and inhibition, and while the excitatory subfield size remains relatively constant during development, the inhibitory subfield is broadened. This balanced developmental strengthening of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs results in enhanced visual responses, and with a reduction of spontaneous firing rate, contributes to the maturation of visual cortical RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing impedes the normal strengthening of excitatory inputs but leaves the apparently normal enhancement of inhibition while preventing the broadening of the inhibitory subfield, leading to weakened RF responses and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting a clear RF, compared with normally reared animals. Our data demonstrate that an experience-dependent and coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory circuits underlie the functional development of visual cortical RFs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The organization of synaptic RFs is a fundamental determinant of feature selectivity functions in the cortex. However, how changes of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs lead to the functional maturation of visual RFs during cortical development remains not well understood. In layer 4 of mouse V1, we show that a coordinated, balanced enhancement of synaptic excitation and inhibition contributes to the developmental maturation of spatially defined visual RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing partially interferes with this process, resulting in a relatively more dominant inhibitory tone and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting clear RFs at the spike level. These data provide an unprecedented understanding of the functional development of visual cortical RFs at the synaptic level.</p>

                <p>Accumulating evidence in the past decade implicates histone-modifying enzymes, such as class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), in learning and memory and, recently, habit formation. However, it is unclear whether HDACs play roles in complex cognitive function. To address this issue, we examined the role of dorsal striatal HDAC5, a class II HDAC, in reward-guided decision-making and associated neural encoding in rats. We first injected adeno-associated virus to overexpress a nuclear-localized HDAC5 in dorsal striatum (DS). We then recorded neural correlates from dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as rats performed two reward-guided choice tasks, in which we manipulated either the size of or delay to reward. During these tasks, rats first learned which of two options led to the better reward and then reversed those contingencies in a second block of trials. We found that rats with HDAC5 overexpression in DS responded faster and chose higher value reward more often during the first block of trials but were less able to reverse those contingencies in the second block of trials. At the neural level, HDAC5 overexpression in DS elevated and reduced the number of cells in DLS that increased firing to stimuli and reward, respectively, and shifted encoding toward cues that predicted more immediate reward. These results suggest that the HDAC5 overexpression in DS contributes to inflexible decision-making, demonstrating a role of histone-modifying enzymes in complex cognitive function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> HDACs are important for learning and habit formation. Here, we expanded on these functions and found that overexpression of HDAC5 produced faster and more automatic behavior, and related changes in dorsolateral striatal neural firing in rats performing a value-based decision-making task. These results implicate HDAC5 as a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric conditions that impair decision-making and executive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Fastigial Output Channels and Their Impact on Temporal Lobe Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite being canonically considered a motor control structure, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized for important roles in processes beyond this traditional framework, including seizure suppression. Excitatory fastigial neurons project to a large number of downstream targets, and it is unclear whether this broad targeting underlies seizure suppression, or whether a specific output may be sufficient. To address this question, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, male and female animals, and a dual-virus approach to selectively label and manipulate fastigial outputs. We examined fastigial neurons projecting to the superior colliculus, medullary reticular formation, and central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and found that these comprise largely nonoverlapping populations of neurons that send collaterals to unique sets of additional, somewhat overlapping, thalamic and brainstem regions. We found that neither optogenetic stimulation of superior colliculus nor reticular formation output channels attenuated hippocampal seizures. In contrast, on-demand stimulation of fastigial neurons targeting the central lateral nucleus robustly inhibited seizures. Our results indicate that fastigial control of hippocampal seizures does not require simultaneous modulation of many fastigial output channels. Rather, selective modulation of the fastigial output channel to the central lateral thalamus, specifically, is sufficient for seizure control. More broadly, our data highlight the concept of specific cerebellar output channels, whereby discrete cerebellar nucleus neurons project to specific aggregates of downstream targets, with important consequences for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum has an emerging relationship with nonmotor systems and may represent a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in temporal lobe epilepsy. We find, as previously reported, that fastigial neurons project to numerous brain regions via largely segregated output channels, and that projection targets cannot be predicted simply by somatic locations within the nucleus. We further find that on-demand optogenetic excitation of fastigial neurons projecting to the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus&mdash;but not fastigial neurons projecting to the reticular formation, superior colliculus, or ventral lateral thalamus&mdash;is sufficient to attenuate hippocampal seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Supervised Multisensory Calibration Signals Are Evident in VIP But Not MSTd</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multisensory plasticity enables our senses to dynamically adapt to each other and the external environment, a fundamental operation that our brain performs continuously. We searched for neural correlates of adult multisensory plasticity in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) in 2 male rhesus macaques using a paradigm of supervised calibration. We report little plasticity in neural responses in the relatively low-level multisensory cortical area MSTd. In contrast, neural correlates of plasticity are found in higher-level multisensory VIP, an area with strong decision-related activity. Accordingly, we observed systematic shifts of VIP tuning curves, which were reflected in the choice-related component of the population response. This is the first demonstration of neuronal calibration, together with behavioral calibration, in single sessions. These results lay the foundation for understanding multisensory neural plasticity, applicable broadly to maintaining accuracy for sensorimotor tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multisensory plasticity is a fundamental and continual function of the brain that enables our senses to adapt dynamically to each other and to the external environment. Yet, very little is known about the neuronal mechanisms of multisensory plasticity. In this study, we searched for neural correlates of adult multisensory plasticity in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) using a paradigm of supervised calibration. We found little plasticity in neural responses in the relatively low-level multisensory cortical area MSTd. By contrast, neural correlates of plasticity were found in VIP, a higher-level multisensory area with strong decision-related activity. This is the first demonstration of neuronal calibration, together with behavioral calibration, in single sessions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timescales of Local and Cross-Area Interactions during Neuroprosthetic Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain integrate signals with different timescales to drive purposeful actions? Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer a powerful tool to causally test how distributed neural networks achieve specific neural patterns. During neuroprosthetic learning, actuator movements are causally linked to primary motor cortex (M1) neurons, i.e., "direct" neurons that project to the decoder and whose firing is required to successfully perform the task. However, it is unknown how such direct M1 neurons interact with both "indirect" local (in M1 but not part of the decoder) and across area neural populations (e.g., in premotor cortex/M2), all of which are embedded in complex biological recurrent networks. Here, we trained male rats to perform a M1-BMI task and simultaneously recorded the activity of indirect neurons in both M2 and M1. We found that both M2 and M1 indirect neuron populations could be used to predict the activity of the direct neurons (i.e., "BMI-potent activity"). Interestingly, compared with M1 indirect activity, M2 neural activity was correlated with BMI-potent activity across a longer set of time lags, and the timescale of population activity patterns evolved more slowly. M2 units also predicted the activity of both M1 direct and indirect neural populations, suggesting that M2 population dynamics provide a continuous modulatory influence on M1 activity as a whole, rather than a moment-by-moment influence solely on neurons most relevant to a task. Together, our results indicate that longer timescale M2 activity provides modulatory influence over extended time lags on shorter-timescale control signals in M1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A central question in the study of motor control is whether primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor cortex (M2) interact through task-specific subpopulations of neurons, or whether tasks engage broader correlated networks. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are powerful tools to study cross-area interactions. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of M1 and M2 in a BMI task using a subpopulation of M1 neurons (direct neurons). We found that activity outside of direct neurons in M1 and M2 was predictive of M1-BMI task activity, and that M2 activity evolved at slower timescales than M1. These findings suggest that M2 provides a continuous modulatory influence on M1 as a whole, supporting a model of interactions through broad correlated networks rather than task-specific neural subpopulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Feedback, Early Sensory Representations, and Fast Responses to Predicted Stimuli Depend on NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior (e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way). While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning, we show that inferred "causal" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audiovisual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive &beta; feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine, perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex, and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests that predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, &beta; feedback, and NMDARs, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We learn the statistical regularities around us, creating associations between sensory stimuli. These associations can be exploited by generating predictions, which enable fast and efficient behavior. When predictions are perturbed, it can negatively influence perception and even contribute to psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Here we show that the frontal lobe generates predictions and sends them to posterior brain areas, to activate representations of predicted sensory stimuli before their appearance. Oscillations in neural activity (&alpha; and &beta; waves) are vital for these predictive mechanisms. The drug ketamine blocks predictions and the underlying mechanisms. This suggests that the generation of predictions in the frontal lobe, and the feedback pre-activating sensory representations in advance of stimuli, depend on NMDARs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Selectively Drive Coordinated Motor Learning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The recruitment of motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here, we identify a role for the baso-cortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning is known to drive refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine release from basal forebrain cholinergic neuron terminals rapidly modulates neuronal excitability, circuit dynamics, and cortical coding; all processes required for processing complex sensory information, cognition, and attention. We found that depletion or transient silencing of cholinergic inputs to anatomically isolated motor areas, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, selectively led to significant impairments on coordinated motor learning; disrupting this baso-cortical network after acquisition elicited no effect on task execution. Our results indicate a pivotal role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning. These findings support the concept that cognitive components (such as attention) are indispensable in the adjustment of motor output and training-induced improvements in motor performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interaural Place-of-Stimulation Mismatch Estimates Using CT Scans and Binaural Perception, But Not Pitch, Are Consistent in Cochlear-Implant Users</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bilateral cochlear implants (BI-CIs) or a CI for single-sided deafness (SSD-CI; one normally functioning acoustic ear) can partially restore spatial-hearing abilities, including sound localization and speech understanding in noise. For these populations, however, interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can occur and thus diminish binaural sensitivity that relies on interaurally frequency-matched neurons. This study examined whether plasticity&mdash;reorganization of central neural pathways over time&mdash;can compensate for peripheral interaural place mismatch. We hypothesized differential plasticity across two systems: none for binaural processing but adaptation for pitch perception toward frequencies delivered by the specific electrodes. Interaural place mismatch was evaluated in 19 BI-CI and 23 SSD-CI human subjects (both sexes) using binaural processing (interaural-time-difference discrimination with simultaneous bilateral stimulation), pitch perception (pitch ranking for single electrodes or acoustic tones with sequential bilateral stimulation), and physical electrode-location estimates from computed-tomography (CT) scans. On average, CT scans revealed relatively little BI-CI interaural place mismatch (26&deg; insertion-angle mismatch) but a relatively large SSD-CI mismatch, particularly at low frequencies (166&deg; for an electrode tuned to 300 Hz, decreasing to 14&deg; at 7000 Hz). For BI-CI subjects, the three metrics were in agreement because there was little mismatch. For SSD-CI subjects, binaural and CT measurements were in agreement, suggesting little binaural-system plasticity induced by mismatch. The pitch measurements disagreed with binaural and CT measurements, suggesting place-pitch plasticity or a procedural bias. These results suggest that reducing interaural place mismatch and potentially improving binaural processing by reprogramming the CI frequency allocation would be better done using CT-scan than pitch information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electrode-array placement for cochlear implants (bionic prostheses that partially restore hearing) does not explicitly align neural representations of frequency information. The resulting interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can diminish spatial-hearing abilities. In this study, adults with two cochlear implants showed reasonable interaural alignment, whereas those with one cochlear implant but normal hearing in the other ear often showed mismatch. In cases of mismatch, binaural sensitivity was best when the same cochlear locations were stimulated in both ears, suggesting that binaural brainstem pathways do not experience plasticity to compensate for mismatch. In contrast, interaurally pitch-matched electrodes deviated from cochlear-location estimates and did not optimize binaural sensitivity. Clinical correction of interaural place mismatch using binaural or computed-tomography (but not pitch) information may improve spatial-hearing benefits.</p>

                <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) exhibit compartmentalized organization, receiving synaptic inputs through their dendrites and transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve. Little is known about the structure of RGC axon bundles extending from individual RGC somas to the optic nerve head (ONH) and how they respond to disease insults. We recently introduced visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF), a technique for directly visualizing and analyzing mouse RGC axon bundles <I>in vivo</I>. In this study, we validated vis-OCTF's ability to quantify RGC axon bundles with an increased number of RGCs using mice deficient in BCL2-associated X protein (BAX<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). Next, we performed optic nerve crush (ONC) injury on wild-type (WT) mice and showed that the changes in RGC axon bundle width and thickness were location-dependent. Our work demonstrates the potential of vis-OCTF to longitudinally quantify and track RGC damage at single axon bundle level in optic neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nearly all clinical and preclinical studies measure the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) thickness as the sole indicator of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) damage without investigating RGC axon bundles directly. We demonstrated visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF) to directly quantify global and regional RGC axon bundle organizations <I>in vivo</I> as a new biomarker for RGC health. We validated <I>in vivo</I> vis-OCTF measures using both confocal microscopy of the immunostained flat-mounted retina and numerical simulations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hyperexcitability and Pharmacological Responsiveness of Cortical Neurons Derived from Human iPSCs Carrying Epilepsy-Associated Sodium Channel Nav1.2-L1342P Genetic Variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>With the wide adoption of genomic sequencing in children having seizures, an increasing number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been revealed as genetic causes of epilepsy. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, encoded by gene <I>SCN2A</I>, is predominantly expressed in the pyramidal excitatory neurons and supports action potential (AP) firing. One recurrent <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variant is L1342P, which was identified in multiple patients with epileptic encephalopathy and intractable seizures. However, the mechanism underlying L1342P-mediated seizures and the pharmacogenetics of this variant in human neurons remain unknown. To understand the core phenotypes of the L1342P variant in human neurons, we took advantage of a reference human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line from a male donor, in which L1342P was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Using patch-clamping and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings, we revealed that cortical neurons derived from hiPSCs carrying heterozygous L1342P variant have significantly increased intrinsic excitability, higher sodium current density, and enhanced bursting and synchronous network firing, suggesting hyperexcitability phenotypes. Interestingly, L1342P neuronal culture displayed a degree of resistance to the anticonvulsant medication phenytoin, which recapitulated aspects of clinical observation of patients carrying the L1342P variant. In contrast, phrixotoxin-3 (PTx3), a Nav1.2 isoform-specific blocker, can potently alleviate spontaneous and chemically-induced hyperexcitability of neurons carrying the L1342P variant. Our results reveal a possible pathogenic underpinning of Nav1.2-L1342P mediated epileptic seizures and demonstrate the utility of genome-edited hiPSCs as an <I>in vitro</I> platform to advance personalized phenotyping and drug discovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A mounting number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been identified from patients with epilepsy, but how <I>SCN2A</I> variants affect the function of human neurons contributing to seizures is still elusive. This study investigated the functional consequences of a recurring <I>SCN2A</I> variant (L1342P) using human iPSC-derived neurons and revealed both intrinsic and network hyperexcitability of neurons carrying a mutant Nav1.2 channel. Importantly, this study recapitulated elements of clinical observations of drug-resistant features of the L1342P variant, and provided a platform for <I>in vitro</I> drug testing. Our study sheds light on cellular mechanism of seizures resulting from a recurring Nav1.2 variant, and helps to advance personalized drug discovery to treat patients carrying pathogenic <I>SCN2A</I> variant.</p>

                Averrhoa bilimbi is a fast-growing tree widely found in countries of tropical Asia. Due to easy accessibility and traditional knowledge, various parts of this plant are adopted as folk medicine and a natural health remedy. Recently, beneficial effects of bilimbi in combating obesity including its potential antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic activities have been discovered. This paper reports the successive isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from the leaf of bilimbi that corresponds to brown adipocyte activation. Bilimbi ethanolic extract underwent bioassay-guided partitioning and fractionation. The n-hexane partition exhibited highest brown adipogenesis potential via adipomyocytes differentiation. Further isolation of this active partition yielded 10 fractions. Active fractions with the highest brown adipogenesis potential were further evaluated via the adipomyocytes assay. Chemical structures of the constituents were elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major phytocomponents in the n-hexane partition include hexadecanoic acid, phytol, 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)- and squalene.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Development of an experiment-split method for benchmarking the generalization of a PTM site predictor: Lysine methylome as an example</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guoyang Zou, Yang Zou, Chenglong Ma, Jiaojiao Zhao, Lei Li</p>

Many computational classifiers have been developed to predict different types of post-translational modification sites. Their performances are measured using cross-validation or independent test, in which experimental data from different sources are mixed and randomly split into training and test sets. However, the self-reported performances of most classifiers based on this measure are generally higher than their performances in the application of new experimental data. It suggests that the cross-validation method overestimates the generalization ability of a classifier. Here, we proposed a generalization estimate method, dubbed experiment-split test, where the experimental sources for the training set are different from those for the test set that simulate the data derived from a new experiment. We took the prediction of lysine methylome (Kme) as an example and developed a deep learning-based Kme site predictor (called DeepKme) with outstanding performance. We assessed the experiment-split test by comparing it with the cross-validation method. We found that the performance measured using the experiment-split test is lower than that measured in terms of cross-validation. As the test data of the experiment-split method were derived from an independent experimental source, this method could reflect the generalization of the predictor. Therefore, we believe that the experiment-split method can be applied to benchmark the practical performance of a given PTM model. DeepKme is free accessible via https://github.com/guoyangzou/DeepKme.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multifunctional RNA-binding proteins influence mRNA abundance and translational efficiency of distinct sets of target genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valentin Schneider-Lunitz, Jorge Ruiz-Orera, Norbert Hubner, Sebastiaan van Heesch</p>

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate more than a single aspect of RNA metabolism. We searched for such previously undiscovered multifunctionality within a set of 143 RBPs, by defining the predictive value of RBP abundance for the transcription and translation levels of known RBP target genes across 80 human hearts. This led us to newly associate 27 RBPs with cardiac translational regulation <i>in vivo</i>. Of these, 21 impacted both RNA expression and translation, albeit for virtually independent sets of target genes. We highlight a subset of these, including G3BP1, PUM1, UCHL5, and DDX3X, where dual regulation is achieved through differential affinity for target length, by which separate biological processes are controlled. Like the RNA helicase DDX3X, the known splicing factors EFTUD2 and PRPF8—all identified as multifunctional RBPs by our analysis—selectively influence target translation rates depending on 5’ UTR structure. Our analyses identify dozens of RBPs as being multifunctional and pinpoint potential novel regulators of translation, postulating unanticipated complexity of protein-RNA interactions at consecutive stages of gene expression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeepCME: A deep learning framework for computing solution statistics of the chemical master equation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ankit Gupta, Christoph Schwab, Mustafa Khammash</p>

Stochastic models of biomolecular reaction networks are commonly employed in systems and synthetic biology to study the effects of stochastic fluctuations emanating from reactions involving species with low copy-numbers. For such models, the Kolmogorov’s forward equation is called the chemical master equation (CME), and it is a fundamental system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes the evolution of the probability distribution of the random state-vector representing the copy-numbers of all the reacting species. The size of this system is given by the number of states that are accessible by the chemical system, and for most examples of interest this number is either very large or infinite. Moreover, approximations that reduce the size of the system by retaining only a finite number of important chemical states (e.g. those with non-negligible probability) result in high-dimensional ODE systems, even when the number of reacting species is small. Consequently, accurate numerical solution of the CME is very challenging, despite the linear nature of the underlying ODEs. One often resorts to estimating the solutions via computationally intensive stochastic simulations. The goal of the present paper is to develop a novel deep-learning approach for computing solution statistics of high-dimensional CMEs by reformulating the stochastic dynamics using Kolmogorov’s backward equation. The proposed method leverages superior approximation properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reliably estimate expectations under the CME solution for several user-defined functions of the state-vector. This method is algorithmically based on reinforcement learning and it only requires a moderate number of stochastic simulations (in comparison to typical simulation-based approaches) to train the “policy function”. This allows not just the numerical approximation of various expectations for the CME solution but also of its sensitivities with respect to all the reaction network parameters (e.g. rate constants). We provide four examples to illustrate our methodology and provide several directions for future research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Benchmarking of tools for axon length measurement in individually-labeled projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mario Rubio-Teves, Sergio Díez-Hermano, César Porrero, Abel Sánchez-Jiménez, Lucía Prensa, Francisco Clascá, María García-Amado, José Antonio Villacorta-Atienza</p>

Projection neurons are the commonest neuronal type in the mammalian forebrain and their individual characterization is a crucial step to understand how neural circuitry operates. These cells have an axon whose arborizations extend over long distances, branching in complex patterns and/or in multiple brain regions. Axon length is a principal estimate of the functional impact of the neuron, as it directly correlates with the number of synapses formed by the axon in its target regions; however, its measurement by direct 3D axonal tracing is a slow and labor-intensive method. On the contrary, axon length estimations have been recently proposed as an effective and accessible alternative, allowing a fast approach to the functional significance of the single neuron. Here, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the most used length estimation tools—design-based stereology by virtual planes or spheres, and mathematical correction of the 2D projected-axon length—in contrast with direct measurement, to quantify individual axon length. To this end, we computationally simulated each tool, applied them over a dataset of 951 3D-reconstructed axons (from NeuroMorpho.org), and compared the generated length values with their 3D reconstruction counterparts. The evaluated reliability of each axon length estimation method was then balanced with the required human effort, experience and know-how, and economic affordability. Subsequently, computational results were contrasted with measurements performed on actual brain tissue sections. We show that the plane-based stereological method balances acceptable errors (~5%) with robustness to biases, whereas the projection-based method, despite its accuracy, is prone to inherent biases when implemented in the laboratory. This work, therefore, aims to provide a constructive benchmark to help guide the selection of the most efficient method for measuring specific axonal morphologies according to the particular circumstances of the conducted research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tinnitus-like “hallucinations” elicited by sensory deprivation in an entropy maximization recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aviv Dotan, Oren Shriki</p>

Sensory deprivation has long been known to cause hallucinations or “phantom” sensations, the most common of which is tinnitus induced by hearing loss, affecting 10–20% of the population. An observable hearing loss, causing auditory sensory deprivation over a band of frequencies, is present in over 90% of people with tinnitus. Existing plasticity-based computational models for tinnitus are usually driven by homeostatic mechanisms, modeled to fit phenomenological findings. Here, we use an objective-driven learning algorithm to model an early auditory processing neuronal network, e.g., in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The learning algorithm maximizes the network’s output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model. We show that the connectivity patterns and responses learned by the model display several hallmarks of early auditory neuronal networks. We further demonstrate that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the recurrent network towards its critical point and transition into a tinnitus-like state. In this state, the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation, namely, it “hallucinates” auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how objective-driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the network’s input representation can also elicit pathologies such as tinnitus as a result of sensory deprivation.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signalling is essential for the proliferation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria blood stage parasites. The mechanisms regulating the activity of the catalytic subunit PfPKAc, however, are only partially understood, and PfPKAc function has not been investigated in gametocytes, the sexual blood stage forms that are essential for malaria transmission. By studying a conditional PfPKAc knockdown (cKD) mutant, we confirm the essential role for PfPKAc in erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and show that PfPKAc is involved in regulating gametocyte deformability. We furthermore demonstrate that overexpression of PfPKAc is lethal and kills parasites at the early phase of schizogony. Strikingly, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of parasite mutants selected to tolerate increased PfPKAc expression levels identified missense mutations exclusively in the gene encoding the parasite orthologue of 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1 (PfPDK1). Using targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that PfPDK1 is required to activate PfPKAc and that T189 in the PfPKAc activation loop is the crucial target residue in this process. In summary, our results corroborate the importance of tight regulation of PfPKA signalling for parasite survival and imply that PfPDK1 acts as a crucial upstream regulator in this pathway and potential new drug target.

Endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) is a protein quality control pathway of fundamental importance to cellular homeostasis. Although multiple ERAD pathways exist for targeting topologically distinct substrates, all pathways require substrate ubiquitination. Here, we characterize a key role for the UBE2G2 Binding Region (G2BR) of the ERAD accessory protein ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (AUP1) in ERAD pathways. This 27-amino acid (aa) region of AUP1 binds with high specificity and low nanomolar affinity to the backside of the ERAD ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UBE2G2. The structure of the AUP1 G2BR (G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup>) in complex with UBE2G2 reveals an interface that includes a network of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions essential for AUP1 function in cells. The G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> shares significant structural conservation with the G2BR found in the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78 and in vitro can similarly allosterically activate ubiquitination in conjunction with ERAD E3s. In cells, AUP1 is uniquely required to maintain normal levels of UBE2G2; this is due to G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> binding to the E2 and preventing its rapid degradation. In addition, the G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> is required for both ER membrane recruitment of UBE2G2 and for its activation at the ER membrane. Thus, by binding to the backside of a critical ERAD E2, G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> plays multiple critical roles in ERAD.

Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most frequent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (��2(3)= 10.918; p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: An increase in anisometropia with the educational stage, was found in this study. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in children undergoing elective surgeries: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prehabilitation is a therapeutic strategy involving preoperative physical exercises, nutritional support, and stress and anxiety reduction. This approach has been gaining popularity and has been seeing effective results in adults in terms of improving pre and postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this review was to summarise the evidence about the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation programs on various outcome measures in children post elective surgeries.­­ Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL/EBSCO and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Based on the inclusion criteria, titles and abstracts were independently screened by the authors. After that, a data extraction table of the selected studies which included the participants, type, and details of exercise intervention, outcome measures and results were analysed after which the quality assessment of the studies was done. Results: The search yielded 2219 articles of which three articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria with two studies being randomized controlled trials and one being a quasi-experimental pre-post type of study. One randomized controlled trial was on the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in reducing pulmonary complications post cardiac surgeries in children and the other two studies were on the effects of prehabilitation on functional capacity & pulmonary function. All the three articles found that exercise-based prehabilitation had a positive effect on children’s post-surgery. Conclusion: Although there is a paucity of evidence-based literature, we conclude based on the existing literature retrieved by our review that exercise-based prehabilitation improves postoperative outcomes and helps in reducing postoperative complications in children undergoing various surgeries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">MSTCN: A multiscale temporal convolutional network for user independent human activity recognition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent years, human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research topic due to its widespread application in various fields such as healthcare, sports, patient monitoring, etc. HAR approaches can be categorised as handcrafted feature methods (HCF) and deep learning methods (DL). HCF involves complex data pre-processing and manual feature extraction in which the models may be exposed to high bias and crucial implicit pattern loss. Hence, DL approaches are introduced due to their exceptional recognition performance. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts spatial features while preserving localisation. However, it hardly captures temporal features. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learns temporal features, but it is susceptible to gradient vanishing and suffers from short-term memory problems. Unlike RNN, Long-Short Term Memory network has a relatively longer-term dependency. However, it consumes higher computation and memory because it computes and stores partial results at each level. Methods: This work proposes a novel multiscale temporal convolutional network (MSTCN) based on the Inception model with a temporal convolutional architecture. Unlike HCF methods, MSTCN requires minimal pre-processing and no manual feature engineering. Further, multiple separable convolutions with different-sized kernels are used in MSTCN for multiscale feature extraction. Dilations are applied to each separable convolution to enlarge the receptive fields without increasing the model parameters. Moreover, residual connections are utilised to prevent information loss and gradient vanishing. These features enable MSTCN to possess a longer effective history while maintaining a relatively low in-network computation. Results: The performance of MSTCN is evaluated on UCI and WISDM datasets using subject independent protocol with no overlapping subjects between the training and testing sets. MSTCN achieves F1 scores of 0.9752 on UCI and 0.9470 on WISDM. Conclusion: The proposed MSTCN dominates the other state-of-the-art methods by acquiring high recognition accuracies without requiring any manual feature engineering.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hobotnica: exploring molecular signature quality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A Molecular Features Set (MFS), is a result of a vast diversity of bioinformatics pipelines. The lack of a “gold standard” for most experimental data modalities makes it difficult to provide valid estimation for a particular MFS's quality. Yet, this goal can partially be achieved by analyzing inner-sample Distance Matrices (DM) and their power to distinguish between phenotypes. The quality of a DM can be assessed by summarizing its power to quantify the differences of inner-phenotype and outer-phenotype distances. This estimation of the DM quality can be construed as a measure of the MFS's quality.  Here we propose Hobotnica, an approach to estimate MFSs quality by their ability to stratify data, and assign them significance scores, that allow for collating various signatures and comparing their quality for contrasting groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">AXIN-AMPK signaling: Implications for healthy aging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) and the master scaffolding protein, AXIN, are two major regulators of biological processes in metazoans. AXIN-dependent regulation of AMPK activation plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis during glucose-deprived and energy-stressed conditions. The two proteins are also required for muscle function. While studies have refined our knowledge of various cellular events that promote the formation of AXIN-AMPK complexes and the involvement of effector proteins, more work is needed to understand precisely how the pathway is regulated in response to various forms of stress. In this review, we discuss recent data on AXIN and AMPK interaction and its role in physiological changes leading to improved muscle health and an extension of lifespan. We argue that AXIN-AMPK signaling plays an essential role in maintaining muscle function and manipulating the pathway in a tissue-specific manner could delay muscle aging. Therefore, research on understanding the factors that regulate AXIN-AMPK signaling holds the potential for developing novel therapeutics to slow down or revert the age-associated decline in muscle function, thereby extending the healthspan of animals.

                Background: Schizophrenia has a broad range of interrelated symptoms and impairment in functioning. The objective of the study was to explore the interplay between positive symptoms, negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia using network analysis. Methods: Participants were 64 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathologic, neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome were measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III, Faces test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and Personal Social Performance scale. Results: The network analysis suggested that functional outcome was the most central in the network followed by avolition and asociality. Functioning was directly connected to avolition, asociality, blunted affect, neurocognition and emotion recognition. The positive symptoms were the most remote and therefore the least important node. Conclusion: The high centrality of functioning suggests the need for improving of everyday life skills for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, treatment of specific negative symptoms, neurocognition and emotion recognition could also enhance functional outcome.

                Background: An earlier systematic review reported no differences in the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding between factor Xa inhibitors and standard anticoagulation. The present meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of factor Xa inhibitors for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), specifically in patients with cancer, as there were more randomized clinical trials (RCTs) available. Methods: The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were systematically screened for all RCTs assessing factor Xa inhibitor efficacy for VTE management in cancer patients. Using RevMan 5.3, we performed a Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effects meta-analysis of the following outcomes: recurrent VTE, VTE events, and major bleeding rates. Results: We identified 11 studies involving 7,965 patients. Factor Xa inhibitors were superior in preventing VTE recurrence, compared to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45–0.80; P < 0.01) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.78; P < 0.01). As prophylaxis, factor Xa inhibitors had a similar rate of VTE compared to VKAs (OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.31–3.77]; P = 0.90) and a lower rate compared to placebo (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.35–0.81]; P < 0.01). Major bleeding rates were higher with factor Xa inhibitors than with LMWHs (OR 1.34 [95% CI 0.83–2.18]; P = 0.23), but significantly lower than VKAs (OR 0.71 [95% CI 0.55–0.92]; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Factor Xa inhibitors are effective for VTE management in patients with cancer; however, they are also associated with an increased bleeding risk compared to LMWH, but decreased when compared to VKA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Spinal cord atrophy predicts progressive disease in relapsing multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A major challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS) research is the understanding of silent progression and Progressive MS. Using a novel method to accurately capture upper cervical cord area from legacy brain MRI scans we aimed to study the role of spinal cord and brain atrophy for silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease (SPMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a single-center observational study, all RRMS (n=360) and SPMS (n=47) patients and 80 matched controls were evaluated. RRMS patient subsets who converted to SPMS (n=54) or silently progressed (n=159), respectively, during the 12-year observation period were compared to clinically matched RRMS patients remaining RRMS (n=54) or stable (n=147), respectively. From brain MRI, we assessed the value of brain and spinal cord measures to predict silent progression and SPMS conversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients who developed SPMS showed faster cord atrophy rates (-2.19 %/year) at least four years before conversion compared to their RRMS matches (-0.88 %/year, p&lt;0.001). Spinal cord atrophy rates decelerated after conversion (-1.63%/year, <i>p</i>=0.010) towards those of SPMS patients from study entry (-1.04%). Each 1% faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associated with 69% (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) and 53% (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) shorter time to silent progression and SPMS conversion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease are predominantly related to cervical cord atrophy. This atrophy is often present from the earliest disease stages and predicts the speed of silent progression and conversion to Progressive MS. Diagnosis of SPMS is rather a late recognition of this neurodegenerative process than a distinct disease phase.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic (M1) cholinergic receptor activation within the dorsal hippocampus promotes destabilization of strongly encoded object location memories</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the initial consolidation process, memories can become reactivated by exposure to a reminder of the original learning event. This can lead to the memory becoming destabilized and vulnerable to disruption or other forms of modification. The memory must then undergo the protein-synthesis dependent process of reconsolidation in order to be retained. However, older and/or stronger memories resist destabilization, but can become labile when reactivated in the presence of salient novelty. We have implicated the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acting at M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) within perirhinal cortex (PRh), in novelty-induced destabilization of remote object memories. It remains unclear, however, whether mAChRs are involved in destabilization of other forms of memory. We hypothesized that the role of M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs previously demonstrated for PRh-dependent object memory would extend to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Using the object location (OL) task, which relies on the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), we showed that (a) reactivation-dependent reconsolidation of OL memories requires protein synthesis within the dHPC; (b) destabilization of relatively weak OL memories depends on M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC; (c) salient novelty during reactivation promotes destabilization of resistant strongly encoded OL memories; (d) novelty-induced destabilization of strong OL memories requires activation of mAChRs within the dHPC; and (e) M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC in the absence of novelty during memory reactivation mimics the effect of novelty, destabilizing strongly encoded OL memories. These results implicate ACh acting at M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs in the destabilization of dHPC-dependent spatial memories, demonstrating generalizability of this cholinergic function beyond memory for object identity. These findings therefore enhance our understanding of the dynamics of long-term memory storage and suggest implications for the treatment of human conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are characterized by behavioral and mnemonic inflexibility.</p>

                <p>For the first time an ecstatic aura has been evoked through the electrical stimulation of the dorsal anterior insula during pre-surgical invasive intracerebral monitoring in a patient who did not suffer from an ecstatic form of epilepsy. This case provides more evidence that the anterior insula is the major generator of such a mystical-type experience even in individuals with no underlying brain network changes related to a pre-existing ecstatic epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DBS of thalamic centromedian nucleus for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (ESTEL trial)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received three-months stimulation (blinded phase), then all received three-months stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥ 50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory EEG at the end of blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017–December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 females) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single centre in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10; control, n = 9). 50% of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (OR3.1; 95%CI 0.44–21.45; p = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR23.25; 95%CI 1.0–538.4; p = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (IQR 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after three-months of stimulation. 50% of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at study exit, providing supporting evidence of treatment effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of a stereotypic molecular arrangement of endogenous glycine receptors at spinal cord synapses</a></h4>

              
                Precise quantitative information about the molecular architecture of synapses is essential to understanding the functional specificity and downstream signaling processes at specific populations of synapses. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are the primary fast inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the spinal cord and brainstem. These inhibitory glycinergic networks crucially regulate motor and sensory processes. Thus far the nanoscale organization of GlyRs underlying the different network specificities has not been defined. Here, we have quantitatively characterized the molecular arrangement and ultra-structure of glycinergic synapses in spinal cord tissue using quantitative super-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy (SR-CLEM). We show that endogenous GlyRs exhibit equal receptor-scaffold occupancy and constant packing densities of about 2000 GlyRs µm<sup>-2</sup> at synapses across the spinal cord and throughout adulthood, even though ventral horn synapses have twice the total copy numbers, larger postsynaptic domains and more convoluted morphologies than dorsal horn synapses. We demonstrate that this stereotypic molecular arrangement is maintained at glycinergic synapses in the <i>oscillator</i> mouse model of the neuromotor disease hyperekplexia despite a decrease in synapse size, indicating that the molecular organization of GlyRs is preserved in this hypomorph. We thus conclude that the morphology and size of inhibitory postsynaptic specializations rather than differences in GlyR packing determine the postsynaptic strength of glycinergic neurotransmission in motor and sensory spinal cord networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assessing target engagement using proteome-wide solvent shift assays</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled quantitative proteomics to become a powerful tool in the field of drug discovery, especially when applied toward proteome-wide target engagement studies. Similar to temperature gradients, increasing concentrations of organic solvents stimulate unfolding and precipitation of the cellular proteome. This property can be influenced by physical association with ligands and other molecules, making individual proteins more or less susceptible to solvent-induced denaturation. Herein, we report the development of proteome-wide solvent shift assays by combining the principles of solvent-induced precipitation (Zhang et al., 2020) with modern quantitative proteomics. Using this approach, we developed solvent proteome profiling (SPP), which is capable of establishing target engagement through analysis of SPP denaturation curves. We readily identified the specific targets of compounds with known mechanisms of action. As a further efficiency boost, we applied the concept of area under the curve analysis to develop solvent proteome integral solubility alteration (solvent-PISA) and demonstrate that this approach can serve as a reliable surrogate for SPP. We propose that by combining SPP with alternative methods, like thermal proteome profiling, it will be possible to increase the absolute number of high-quality melting curves that are attainable by either approach individually, thereby increasing the fraction of the proteome that can be screened for evidence of ligand binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Blood-brain barrier-restricted translocation of Toxoplasma gondii from cortical capillaries</a></h4>

              
                The cellular barriers of the central nervous system proficiently protect the brain parenchyma from infectious insults. Yet, the single-celled parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> commonly causes latent cerebral infection in humans and other vertebrates. Here, we addressed the role of the cerebral vasculature in the passage of <i>T. gondii</i> to the brain parenchyma. Shortly after inoculation in mice, parasites mainly localized to cortical capillaries, in preference over post-capillary venules, cortical arterioles or meningeal and choroidal vessels. Early invasion to the parenchyma (days 1-5) occurred in absence of a measurable increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, perivascular leukocyte cuffs or hemorrhage. However, sparse focalized permeability elevations were detected adjacently to replicative parasite foci. Further, <i>T. gondii</i> triggered inflammatory responses in cortical microvessels and endothelium. Pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments of mice with LPS and hydrocortisone, respectively, impacted BBB permeability and parasite loads in the brain parenchyma. Finally, pharmacological inhibition or Cre/<i>lox</i>P conditional knockout of endothelial focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a BBB intercellular junction regulator, facilitated parasite translocation to the brain parenchyma. The data reveal that the initial passage of <i>T. gondii</i> to the central nervous system occurs principally across cortical capillaries. The integrity of the microvascular BBB restricts parasite transit, which conversely is exacerbated by the inflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tightly coupled inhibitory and excitatory functional networks in the developing primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical inhibition plays a critical role in shaping activity patterns in the mature cortex. However, little is known about the structure of inhibition in early development prior to the onset of sensory experience, a time when spontaneous activity exhibits long-range correlations predictive of mature functional networks. Here, using calcium imaging of GABAergic neurons in the ferret visual cortex, we show that spontaneous activity in inhibitory neurons is already highly organized into distributed modular networks before visual experience. Inhibitory neurons exhibit spatially modular activity with long-range correlations and precise local organization that is in quantitative agreement with excitatory networks. Furthermore, excitatory and inhibitory networks are strongly co-aligned at both millimeter and cellular scales. These results demonstrate a remarkable degree of organization in inhibitory networks early in the developing cortex, providing support for computational models of self-organizing networks and suggesting a mechanism for the emergence of distributed functional networks during development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear NAD+-biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 facilitates development and early survival of retinal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Despite mounting evidence that the mammalian retina is exceptionally reliant on proper NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis for health and function, the specific roles of subcellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pools in retinal development, maintenance, and disease remain obscure. Here, we show that deletion of the nuclear-localized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1) in the developing murine retina causes early and severe degeneration of photoreceptors and select inner retinal neurons via multiple distinct cell death pathways. This severe phenotype is associated with disruptions to retinal central carbon metabolism, purine nucleotide synthesis, and amino acid pathways. Furthermore, transcriptomic and immunostaining approaches reveal dysregulation of a collection of photoreceptor and synapse-specific genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas prior to detectable morphological or metabolic alterations. Collectively, our study reveals previously unrecognized complexity in NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration and suggests a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in gene regulation during photoreceptor terminal differentiation.
