     alt="Evolution of Axonal Injury in the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration in Adult Ferrets"/>
<p>A clinically relevant ferret model of concussion was established using the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration. This model reproduced key features of diffuse axonal injury, including disrupted axonal transport, neurofilament pathology, and persistent disruption of the nodes of Ranvier, alongside motor and cognitive deficits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Concussion-related symptoms, such as impaired balance, slower processing speed, attention deficits, memory dysfunction, and irritability, are thought to result from diffuse axonal injury (DAI), characterized by selective damage to white matter axons. Axons subjected to this mechanical stretch injury exhibit diverse pathological changes, including disruption of axonal transport, neurofilament compaction and degradation, myelin sheath disruption, and loss of sodium channels required for action potential generation and propagation. These distinct forms of axonal pathology may evolve differentially over time and preferentially localize to specific white matter tracts. In this study, we employed the clinically relevant ferret model of concussion using the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA). 55 male ferrets were randomly allocated to sham or injury groups and then to either 24 h, 72 h, or 14d survival time points. We confirmed that axonal transport disruption and neurofilament pathology represent independent processes, with minimal colocalization but a shared peak of around 72 h following injury. Furthermore, we observed a persistent loss of ankyrin-G, a critical anchoring protein for sodium channels at the node of Ranvier, up to 14d postinjury, suggesting that the resultant impairment in axonal transmission may underlie many concussion symptoms. Indeed, injured ferrets displayed significant deficits in balance, working memory, spatial memory, and recognition memory. These findings demonstrate that the CHIMERA model in ferrets recapitulates key axonal pathologies and their associated clinical manifestations following concussion. This model offers a valuable platform for investigating the temporal evolution of axonal injury and developing targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate concussion-related deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24741">An in-silico integration of neurodevelopmental and dopaminergic views of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have the potential to provide new insights into psychiatric disorders. Here we create a DRL model of schizophrenia: a complex psychotic disorder characterized by anhedonia, avoidance, temporal discounting, catatonia, and hallucinations. Schizophrenia's causes are not well understood: dopaminergic theories emphasize dopamine system dysfunction, while neurodevelopmental theories emphasize abnormal connectivity, including excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in the brain. In this study, we suppressed positive (excitatory) connections within an artificial neural network to simulate E/I imbalance. Interestingly, this is insufficient to create behavioral changes; the network simply compensates for the imbalance. But in doing so it becomes more sensitive to noise. Injecting noise into the network then creates a range of schizophrenic-like behaviours. These findings point to an interesting potential pathology of schizophrenia: E/I imbalance leads to a compensatory response by the network to increase the excitability of neurons, which increases susceptibility to noise. This suggests that the combination of E/I imbalance and neural noise may be key in the emergence of schizophrenic symptoms. We further notice altered response to reward prediction error in our model, and thus propose that E/I imbalance plus noise can account for both schizophrenia symptoms and dopamine system dysfunction: potentially unifying dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24896">Statistical Field Theory and Neural Structures Dynamics V: Synthesis and extensions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified field-theoretic framework for the dynamics of activity and connectivity in interacting neuronal systems. Building upon previous works, where a field approach to activity--connectivity dynamics, formation of collective states and effective fields of collective states were successively introduced, the present paper synthesizes and extends these results toward a general description of multiple hierarchical collective structures. Starting with the dynamical system representing collective states in terms of connections, activity levels, and internal frequencies, we analyze its stability, emphasizing the possibility of transitions between configurations. Then, turning to the field formalism of collective states, we extend this framework to include substructures (subobjects) participating in larger assemblies while retaining intrinsic properties. We define activation classes describing compatible or independent activity patterns between objects and subobjects, and study stability conditions arising from their alignment or mismatch. The global system is described as the collection of landscapes of coexisting and interacting collective states, each characterized both by continuous (activity, frequency) and discrete (class) variables. A corresponding field formalism is developed, with an action functional incorporating both internal dynamics and interaction terms. This nonlinear field model captures cascading transitions between collective states and the formation of composite structures, providing a coherent theoretical basis for emergent neuronal assemblies and their mutual couplings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25119">Effect of an auditory static distractor on the perception of an auditory moving target</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical velocity ("the upper limit"), primarily due to degraded front-back discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of distractors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24733">Decoding non-invasive brain activity with novel deep-learning approaches</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24751">How can methods for classifying and clustering trajectories be used for prevention trials? An example in Alzheimer's disease area</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an intervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis testing. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population. Indeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot detect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm to a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another perspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of subjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of prevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which requires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account. The primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different methods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial with four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite Z-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic mixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is therefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory classification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal data, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised analysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status. Results: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and one of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up. This method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite Z-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised methods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore necessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the rate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation was performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the graphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define responder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria. Discussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have masked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta Amyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to subject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify patterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the potential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the final endpoint considered.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903">Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.24903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields. Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering long-standing questions.

                arXiv:2504.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.

                arXiv:2506.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and outperform the base CNN architecture by 9.3% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 6.2% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.

                arXiv:2510.24965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy paradigm, exemplified by Hopfield networks, offers a principled framework for memory in neural systems by interpreting dynamics as descent on an energy surface. While powerful for static associative memories, it falls short in modeling sequential memory, where transitions between memories are essential. We introduce the Exponential Dynamic Energy Network (EDEN), a novel architecture that extends the energy paradigm to temporal domains by evolving the energy function over multiple timescales. EDEN combines a static high-capacity energy network with a slow, asymmetrically interacting modulatory population, enabling robust and controlled memory transitions. We formally derive short-timescale energy functions that govern local dynamics and use them to analytically compute memory escape times, revealing a phase transition between static and dynamic regimes. The analysis of capacity, defined as the number of memories that can be stored with minimal error rate as a function of the dimensions of the state space (number of feature neurons), for EDEN shows that it achieves exponential sequence memory capacity $O(\gamma^N)$, outperforming the linear capacity $O(N)$ of conventional models. Furthermore, EDEN's dynamics resemble the activity of time and ramping cells observed in the human brain during episodic memory tasks, grounding its biological relevance. By unifying static and sequential memory within a dynamic energy framework, EDEN offers a scalable and interpretable model for high-capacity temporal memory in both artificial and biological systems.

                arXiv:2510.24975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP) distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W) at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and code-domain communications.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Trust-Based Optimization (TBO), a novel extension of the island model in evolutionary computation that replaces conventional periodic migrations with a flexible, agent-driven interaction mechanism based on trust or reputation. Experimental results demonstrate that TBO generally outperforms the standard island model evolutionary algorithm across various optimization problems. Nevertheless, algorithm performance varies depending on the problem type, with certain configurations being more effective for specific landscapes or dimensions. The findings suggest that trust and reputation mechanisms provide a flexible and adaptive approach to evolutionary optimization, improving solution quality in many cases.

Abstract: Synthetic Benchmark Problems (SBPs) are commonly used to evaluate the performance of metaheuristic algorithms. However, these SBPs often contain various unrealistic properties, potentially leading to underestimation or overestimation of algorithmic performance. While several benchmark suites comprising real-world problems have been proposed for various types of metaheuristics, a notable gap exists for Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) derived from practical engineering applications, particularly in the domain of Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) design. To address this gap, this study develops and presents a specialized benchmark suite for multi-objective optimization in BTMS. This suite comprises a diverse collection of real-world constrained problems, each defined via accurate surrogate models based on recent research to efficiently represent complex thermal-fluid interactions. The primary goal of this benchmark suite is to provide a practical and relevant testing ground for evolutionary algorithms and optimization methods focused on energy storage thermal management. Future work will involve establishing comprehensive baseline results using state-of-the-art algorithms, conducting comparative analyses, and developing a standardized ranking scheme to facilitate robust performance assessment.

                arXiv:2510.24951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains, its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware, bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution, Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference, developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling, integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally, probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning systems.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency, meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues. These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates. This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

                arXiv:2510.25368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability. Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05238">Bridging Expressivity and Scalability with Adaptive Unitary SSMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM), a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling AUSSM to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

Abstract: Swarm based optimization algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems. However, their widespread adoption remains sceptical due to limited transparency in how different algorithmic components influence the overall performance of the algorithm. This work presents a multi-faceted interpretability related investigations of one of the popular swarm algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization. Through this work, we provide a framework that makes the role of different topologies and parameters in PSO interpretable and explainable using novel machine learning approach. We first developed a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features in the problem that affects the optimization performance of PSO. Secondly, we rigorously compare three topologies -- Ring, Star, and Von Neumann -- analyzing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behavior, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO. The work successfully decodes how swarm topologies affect information flow, diversity, and convergence. Through systematic experimentation across 24 benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings uncover the black-box nature of PSO, providing more transparency and interpretability to swarm intelligence systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming one of the key technologies of this century. The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with a learning algorithm called error backpropagation, always considered biologically implausible. To this end, recent works have studied learning algorithms for deep neural networks inspired by the neurosciences. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: it can model information processing in different areas of the brain, can be used in control and robotics, has a solid mathematical foundation in variational inference, and performs its computations asynchronously. Inspired by such properties, works that propose novel PC-like algorithms are starting to be present in multiple sub-fields of machine learning and AI at large. Here, we survey such efforts by first providing a broad overview of the history of PC to provide common ground for the understanding of the recent developments, then by describing current efforts and results, and concluding with a large discussion of possible implications and ways forward.

                arXiv:2411.05715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to fuse information from both auditory and visual modalities to help with understanding speech. This is demonstrated through a phenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented with incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept of illusory intermediate phonemes. Building on a recent framework that proposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit the McGurk effect. We show that networks trained entirely on congruent audiovisual speech nevertheless exhibit the McGurk percept. We further investigated 'why' by comparing networks trained on clean speech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to a pronounced increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of audiovisual speech integration. This work also demonstrates that the McGurk effect reliably emerges untrained from the behaviour of both supervised and unsupervised networks, even networks trained only on congruent speech. This supports the notion that artificial neural networks might be useful models for certain aspects of perception and cognition.

Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{non-linear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing its Jacobian matrix to be diagonal, the full sequence can be solved in parallel, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Importantly, the diagonal Jacobian structure of our model results in no performance loss compared to the original model with dense Jacobian, and the approach can be generalized to other non-linear recurrent models, demonstrating broader applicability. On a suite of long-range forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that LrcSSM outperforms Transformers, LRU, S5, and Mamba.

                arXiv:2510.23323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks (PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory. First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation called "$\mu$PC", which for the first time allows stable training of 100+ layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks. Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at scale.

                <p>Psychedelic drugs have garnered increasing attention for their therapeutic potential in treating a variety of psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. The claustrum (CLA), a brain area with remarkable interconnectivity to frontal cortices, has recently been shown to have a dense population of serotonin 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) that are activated by psychedelics. Because psychedelic therapy can require as little as one treatment session, it has been speculated that psychedelics achieve their long-term remedial effects by inducing neuroplasticity in brain areas responsible for psychiatric disease states, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the effects of psychedelics on synaptic plasticity in serotonin receptor-rich brain areas remain entirely unexplored. We applied presynaptic stimuli paired with postsynaptic action potentials (APs) to a subpopulation of CLA neurons projecting to ACC in male rats to find that the psychedelic drug, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), reverses the polarity of synaptic plasticity from long-term depression (LTD) to long-term potentiation (LTP) in a manner that may reflect contribution of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission but is specific to synapses activated by local electrical stimulation. Additionally, we characterize intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CLA&ndash;ACC neurons with and without DOI application, noting several changes to AP dynamics induced by DOI. These findings align with the view that psychedelics induce rapid and lasting synaptic plasticity and strengthen the hypothesis that claustrocortical circuits are highly sensitive to psychedelic drug action.</p>

                <p>Experimental design is a core competency of scientific training with profound implications for research rigor and reproducibility. Yet, trainees often receive minimal guidance to structure their thinking around experimental design. Metacognition&mdash;reflecting on one's own thinking&mdash;offers a powerful tool to strengthen reasoning in this process. Here, we present the AiMS framework, which adapts the classic plan&ndash;monitor&ndash;evaluate cycle of metacognition to the context of experimental design. This framework emphasizes three iterative stages&mdash;Awareness, Analysis, and Adaptation&mdash;that scaffold reflection on an experimental system defined by its Models, Methods, and Measurements and evaluated through Specificity, Sensitivity, and Stability. We illustrate application of the AiMS framework through an interactive neuroanatomy case study and provide a structured worksheet to guide readers in applying it to their own experiments. We also highlight how the framework can assist researchers in organizing their ideas for research proposals and explore the responsible use of generative AI as a metacognitive partner that supports structured reflection without supplanting original intellectual contributions. The AiMS framework complements other principles and practices of rigor by foregrounding deliberate reasoning about assumptions, vulnerabilities, and trade-offs. Our goal is to provide practical tools that foster rigor, creativity, and adaptability in the design of biological experiments, supporting both trainees and their mentors in cultivating reflective scientific practices.</p>

Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <I>Bltp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <I>Bltp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <I>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>

                <p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <I>D</I><SUB>Na+</SUB> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>

                <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <I>k</I>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons are involved in a wide array of key brain functions including movement control and reward-based learning. They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<SUB>v</SUB>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>

                <p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible "zoom lens" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>

                <p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>

                <p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This "handshaking" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>

                <p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<I>DISC1</I>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <I>DISC1</I> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Impaired synaptic inhibition by GABA and glycine contributes to excitatory&ndash;inhibitory imbalance in the spinal cord associated with chronic neuropathic pain; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated how GABAergic and glycinergic inputs regulate synaptic <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn in male and female mice. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-expressing excitatory neurons and vesicular -aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT)-expressing inhibitory neurons exhibited comparable mixed GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Blockade of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors with gabazine or glycine receptors with strychnine potentiated NMDAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, the amplitude of EPSCs monosynaptically evoked from the dorsal root, and puff NMDA currents in VGluT2, but not VGAT, neurons. These effects were abolished by silencing neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin or in <I>Cacna2d1</I> knock-out (KO) mice. In mice with conditional <I>Grin1</I> KO in primary sensory neurons (<I>Grin1</I>-cKO), gabazine and strychnine did not affect mEPSC frequency but still enhanced puff NMDA currents in dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, intrathecal gabazine- or strychnine-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity was diminished by <I>Grin1</I>-cKO, <I>Cacna2d1</I> KO, or &alpha;2-1 C-terminus peptide. Additionally, blocking metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) prevents gabazine- and strychnine-induced increases in NMDAR-mediated mEPSC frequency, evoked EPSCs, and puff NMDA currents in VGluT2 neurons as well as nociceptive hypersensitivity. Our findings reveal that GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition tonically suppresses both presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity at primary afferent-&gt;excitatory neuron synapses. &alpha;2-1 and mGluR5 are essential for disinhibition-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity and synaptic NMDAR hyperactivity in the spinal cord.</p>

                <p>It is still poorly understood how subcortical structures contribute to spontaneous infraslow brain activity. In fact, cortical spontaneous activity is often analyzed in isolation, possibly a result of a long-standing "corticocentric bias". Here, we consider a large cohort of healthy human subjects of either sex (Human Connectome Project database), and we perform a dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analysis to investigate fluctuations of cortical&ndash;subcortical interactions. Our analysis shows that FC shifts in the cortex and the subcortex are synchronized. Two core subcortical "clusters" comprising, respectively, limbic regions (hippocampus and amygdala) and subcortical nuclei (thalamus and basal ganglia) show a temporally flexible coupling with cortical regions. Correspondingly, we consistently observe two recurring FC patterns (states). In State 1, limbic regions couple with the default mode network, and in State 2, they couple with sensorimotor networks. An opposite pattern is observed for the thalamus/basal ganglia. Our findings suggest that cortical&ndash;subcortical interactions contribute to shaping whole-brain spontaneous FC patterns and underline the relevance of including the subcortex in descriptions of large-scale spontaneous brain activity.</p>

                <p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in permanent sensory deficits, significantly impairing the quality of life. These deficits are poorly addressed due to a lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. Here, we utilized a thoracic Level 8 lateral hemisection SCI mouse model (including both male and female mice) and applied a battery of behavioral assays requiring supraspinal transmission of sensory information. We also assessed ascending spinal circuits from the lumbar spinal cord to the brain. By 28&nbsp;d post-SCI, sensory assessments revealed distinct deficits: reduced innocuous sensation in the ipsilateral hindpaw and enhanced sensation in the contralateral hindpaw. Both hindlimbs exhibited disrupted nocifensive behaviors, with chronic neuropathic dysesthesia observed only in the contralateral hindlimb. We provided anatomical evidence to elucidate the neural substrates responsible for these sensory discrepancies. This SCI mouse model mimics key features of human lateral hemisection conditions (Brown&ndash;S&eacute;quard syndrome) and offers a robust platform to explore underlying mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p>Visual object recognition has been extensively studied under fixation conditions, but our natural viewing involves frequent saccadic eye movements that scan multiple local informative features within an object (e.g., eyes and mouth in a face image). These saccades would contribute to object recognition by subserving the integration of sensory information across local features, but mechanistic models underlying this process have yet to be established due to the presumed complexity of the interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems. Here, we employ a framework of perceptual decision making and show that human object categorization behavior with saccades can be quantitatively explained by a model that simply accumulates the sensory evidence available at each moment. Human participants of both sexes performed face and object categorization while they were allowed to freely make saccades to scan local features. Our model could successfully fit the data even during such a free viewing condition, departing from past studies that required controlled eye movements to test trans-saccadic integration. Moreover, further experimental results confirmed that active saccade commands (efference copy) do not substantially contribute to evidence accumulation. Therefore, we propose that object recognition with saccades can be approximated by a parsimonious decision-making model without assuming complex interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems.</p>

                Adequate nutrition is essential during adolescence to support physical growth, cognitive development, and metabolic processes. In Malawi and Ghana, limited dietary diversity and widespread micronutrient deficiencies among adolescents pose significant health challenges. These issues are largely influenced by food insecurity, poverty, and environmental changes. This narrative review examines the nutritional status of adolescents in both countries using data from peer-reviewed studies and policy documents. A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar for studies published between 2014 and 2025. The review focused on dietary patterns, micronutrient status, socio-economic influences, and policy responses. Findings reveal a double burden of malnutrition—undernutrition and rising overweight—especially among adolescent girls. In Malawi, 35% of girls aged 15–19 were anemic; in Ghana, the figure approaches 50%. Poor dietary diversity, food insecurity, and cultural factors contribute to high levels of iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiencies. While school-based nutrition programs and micronutrient supplementation efforts exist, their impact is limited, especially in rural areas. In conclusion, adolescent malnutrition in Malawi and Ghana remains a public health concern, driven by dietary inadequacies and socio-economic disparities, despite ongoing nutrition interventions.

                We present a chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of the hamour, or orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a high-value and significant teleost fish species across West Indo-Pacific regions of the Middle East, South Africa, and Australia. This species is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishing and it is widely cultured around the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The hamour genome was sequenced from one individual male originating from a wild population in the Arabian Gulf and assembled into a 1.07 Gb assembly, the largest 24 superscaffolds making up 99.9% of the assembly. Annotation of the genome identified 28,384 protein-coding genes, with 98.9% single-copy BUSCO gene completeness (Actinopterygii database). These data will support further studies on functional ecological and evolutionary genomics of this species, enhancing the understanding of its biology and its responses to stressors including pathogens.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represents a major public health challenge in Latin America, with limited epidemiological data available for Honduras. HPV prevalence trends across age groups must be understood to build effective preventative measures. Objective To systematically analyze HPV prevalence among Honduran women from 1990 to 2023 across different age groups, and to project future trends through 2035 using time series forecasting methods. Methods PRISMA 2020 guided our proportions systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Tz’ibalnaah, and SciELO searches found age-stratified HPV prevalence studies in Honduran women from 1990 to 2023. We used MedCalc v19.7.1 for meta-analysis and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing in Python v3.10.3 for prevalence estimations. Model accuracy was measured by RMSE and MAE. Results Four studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing data from 1999 to 2023. The pooled HPV prevalence was 42% (95% CI: 21.8%), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 75%). Age-stratified analysis revealed highest prevalence in women aged 15-24 years (10.65% in 2023, increased from 1.26% in 1999) and declining prevalence in women >35 years. Time series projections indicated continued increasing trends for women <35 years and stabilizing or declining trends for those ≥35 years. The Holt-Winters model demonstrated optimal fit for the 35-44 age group (RMSE=0.26, MAE=0.25), but substantial prediction errors for younger age groups (RMSE=3.77 for ages 25-34) highlight the limitations of forecasting with limited temporal data points. Conclusions HPV prevalence shows divergent age-specific trends in Honduras, with increasing rates among younger women and decreasing rates in older age groups. These findings suggest differential impacts of public health interventions across age cohorts and highlight the need for enhanced vaccination coverage and sexual health education targeting adolescents and young adults. The limited number of temporal observations constrains forecast reliability, emphasizing the need for strengthened epidemiological surveillance systems.

                Intracranial teratomas are rare central nervous system germ cell tumors, and their occurrence within the third ventricle of pediatric patients presents significant surgical challenges owing to the proximity of critical neurovascular structures. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy who presented with hydrocephalus and seizures caused by a large multiloculated cystic and solid mass in the third ventricle. An initial attempt at gross total resection via a transcortical transventricular approach was complicated by a massive, life-threatening hemorrhage upon dissection of the tumor from the ventricular floor, which was suspected to be an injury to the internal cerebral vein. The procedure was aborted, and bleeding was controlled with hemostatic packing. After a 10-day period of stabilization in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient underwent a second craniotomy to remove the packing and resect the tumor. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of mature teratoma. Postoperatively, the patient required a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt to treat persistent hydrocephalus and residual left-sided hemiparesis. This case highlights the profound risk of vascular injury during resection of large intraventricular teratomas. It also demonstrates that a staged surgical approach can be a crucial life-saving strategy for managing severe intraoperative complications, allowing patient stabilization before definitive tumor removal.

                Background Transformational leadership (TL) is widely recognized as a key driver of employee innovative behavior (EIB), particularly in higher education institutions where adaptability and creativity are vital. However, the pathways through which TL promotes innovation remain underexplored in developing-country contexts. This study examines the mediating role of organizational culture (OC) in the relationship between TL and EIB in Ethiopian public research universities. Methods A quantitative design was employed involving 726 academic and administrative staff from three public research universities selected through simple random sampling. Standardized instruments measured four TL dimensions—idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration—alongside EIB and OC. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects and assess measurement reliability and validity through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results The analysis revealed varied direct effects of TL dimensions on EIB: inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect, while idealized influence and individualized consideration showed negative direct effects but strong positive indirect effects via OC. Intellectual stimulation demonstrated minimal direct influence but a substantial indirect positive effect through OC. OC itself exhibited a strong and significant positive relationship with EIB, confirming its mediating role in linking TL with innovation. Model fit indices met recommended thresholds (GFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.934, RMSEA = 0.06), validating the robustness of the model. Conclusions The findings underscore the pivotal mediating role of OC in transforming leadership behaviors into innovative actions among university staff. While some TL dimensions alone may not directly enhance innovation, their influence becomes positive when reinforced by a supportive, adaptive, and participatory organizational culture. The study contributes theoretical and empirical insights into leadership–innovation dynamics in African higher education and offers practical guidance for fostering innovation through culturally aligned leadership strategies.

                Choosing a course of study in a Senior High School in Ghana is a major problem for both students and parents, due to the limited number of Courses Offered. The courses are governed by the national education and curriculum framework. The educational policy guideline provided the main courses as: Agriculture, Business, Technical, Home Economics, Visual Arts, General Arts, and General Science options, irrespective of individual career aspiration. A report made public in 2018 indicated that, education in Ghana is not of good quality, students attend school from basic to secondary level for an average of 12 years, only at half capacity. The outcome of the poor quality of the education system is waste of human capital resources. To address these challenges, the study explored education reform and new policies that brings systematic changes across the entire education system, particularly in the design of courses and curricula. The study employed content analysis based on the Ghana Education Service's 2021 second-cycle school register, and data analyzed from the Ghana Senior High Schools Annual Digest 2019/2020. The methodology employed Common Career Selective Programme, a structured basic education and training programme, designed to help improve the quality of education, and for students to explore within a broader curriculum. The proposal modified the seven main courses into 18 major courses, which consist of a course header, abstract, course description, career options and requirements. The results provided a variety of course options that suit individual innate abilities, focused on the student’s career goals, intensify lesson content, improve quality of education, and advance human resource capacity, providing Education-for-All beyond the year 2030. In conclusion, the study proposed education reform for courses and curricula, to promote basic education knowledge, actionable recommendations, and policy amendments to improve and promote quality education in Ghana, West Africa, and other countries globally.

                <p>by Mattia Zanzi, Francesco G. Rinaldi, Silene Fornasaro, Eugenio Piasini, Davide Zoccolan</p>

The brain combines information from multiple sensory modalities to build a consistent representation of the world. The principles by which multimodal stimuli are integrated in cortical hierarchies are well studied, but it is less clear whether and how unimodal inputs shape the processing of signals carried by a different modality. In rodents, for instance, direct connections from primary auditory cortex reach visual cortex, but studies disagree on the impact of these projections on visual cortical processing. Both enhancement and suppression of visually evoked responses by auditory inputs have been reported, as well as sharpening of orientation tuning and improvement in the coding of visual information. Little is known, however, about the functional impact of auditory signals on rodent visual perception. Here we trained a group of rats in a visual temporal frequency (TF) classification task, where the visual stimuli to categorize were paired with simultaneous but task-irrelevant auditory stimuli, to prevent high-level multisensory integration and investigate instead the spontaneous, direct impact of auditory signals on the perception of visual stimuli. Rat classification of visual TF was strongly and systematically altered by the presence of sounds, in a way that was determined by sound intensity but not by its temporal modulation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we developed a Bayesian ideal observer model, combined with a neural coding scheme where neurons linearly encode visual TF but are inhibited by concomitant sounds by a measure that depends on their intensity. This model captured very precisely the full spectrum of rat perceptual choices we observed, supporting the hypothesis that auditory inputs induce an effective compression of the visual perceptual space. This suggests an important role for inhibition as the key mediator of auditory-visual interactions and provides clear, mechanistic hypotheses to be tested by future work on visual cortical codes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1176/v1?src=rss">The Mediating effect of Interest Rates on Board Accountability and Non- performing Loans of Commercial Banks in Western Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Non-performing loans (NPLs) critically threaten banking stability in developing economies. While robust board governance is a known mitigant, the mechanisms particularly the strategic role of interest rate policy set by the board remain underexplored. This study investigates whether interest rates mediate the relationship between board accountability and NPLs. Methods A sequential mixed-methods approach was employed. Data from 232 respondents in commercial banks in Western Uganda were collected via questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the mediation hypothesis. Results Board accountability showed a strong positive correlation with NPL reduction (r = 0.779, p < 0.05). Interest rates partially mediated this relationship (Beta = 0.286, t = 4.443, p = 0.000). Qualitative findings underscored the importance of flexible interest rate policies aligned with borrower risk profiles and economic conditions. Conclusion The study confirms that interest rates significantly mediate the effect of board accountability on NPLs. Enhanced governance frameworks and adaptive interest rate policies are critical for mitigating NPLs and promoting financial stability, particularly in developing economies.

                Liu et al. reveal elevated MMP in leukemia/chemoresistance. Baseline MMP requires cardiolipin-mediated mito-translation, which is disrupted by alexidine via cardiolipin binding. Intercellular MMP differences, linked to stemness/chemosensitivity, are regulated by asparagine availability. Therapeutically, alexidine depletes MMP to eliminate leukemic cells, while ASNase-mediated asparagine depletion chemosensitizes them to conventional therapies.

This behavioral switch, driven by cell intrinsic type I IFN signaling and coupled to ILC1 activation, fortifies the antiviral function of KCs to restrict systemic viral dissemination.

Amphetamine directly triggers monoamine release to induce psychostimulation, likely by bypassing the regular transport cycle. These insights elucidate psychostimulant action and inform therapeutic strategies.

                Microglial STING-type I interferon signaling is known to play a role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Yang et al. find that STING is also expressed in Purkinje neurons. STING activation dysregulates the autonomous firing and pace-making function of Purkinje neurons independently of interferon signaling, leading to neurodegeneration and cerebellar ataxia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103425">Dual-format attentional template during preparation in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed attention relies on forming internal templates of key information relevant for guiding behavior, particularly when preparing for upcoming sensory inputs. However, evidence on how these attentional templates are represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information about the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse (‘pinging’ technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. By engaging this dual-format mechanism during preparation, the brain is able to encode both abstract, non-sensory information and more detailed, sensory information, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. For example, consistent with recent theories of visual search, a predominantly non-sensory template can support the initial guidance and a latent sensory-like format can support prospective stimulus processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93181">Detecting, mapping, and suppressing the spread of a decade-long Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial outbreak with genomics</a></h4>

              
                Whole-genome sequencing is revolutionizing bacterial outbreak investigation, but its application to the clinic remains limited. In 2020, prospective and retrospective surveillance detected a <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> outbreak with 253 isolates collected from 82 patients in 26 wards of a hospital. Its origin was dated to the late 1990s, just after the facility opened, and patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient cases of transmission were inferred. Over time, two epidemic subclones evolved in separate hosts and hospital areas, including newly opened wards, and hospital-wide sampling confirmed reservoirs persisted in the plumbing. Pathoadaptive mutations in genes associated with virulence, cell wall biogenesis, and antibiotic resistance were identified. While the latter correlated with the acquisition of phenotypic resistances to first (cephalosporin), second (carbapenems), and third (colistin) lines of treatment, maximum parsimony suggested that a truncation in a lipopolysaccharide component coincided with the emergence of a subclone prevalent in long-term infections. Since initial identification, extensive infection control efforts guided by routine, near real-time surveillance have proved successful at slowing transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107524">Non-equilibrium strategies enabling ligand specificity by signaling receptors</a></h4>

              
                Signaling receptors often encounter multiple ligands and have been shown to respond selectively to generate appropriate, context-specific outcomes. At thermal equilibrium, ligand specificity is limited by the relative affinities of ligands for their receptors. Here, we present a non-equilibrium model in which receptors overcome thermodynamic constraints to preferentially signal from specific ligands while suppressing others. In our model, multi-site phosphorylation and active receptor degradation act in concert to regulate ligand specificity, with receptor degradation, a common motif in eukaryotes, providing a previously under-appreciated layer of control. Here, ligand-bound receptors undergo sequential phosphorylation, with progression restarted by ligand unbinding or receptor turnover. High-affinity complexes are kinetically sorted toward degradation-prone states, while low-affinity complexes are sorted toward inactivated states, both limiting signaling. As a result, network activity is maximized for ligands with intermediate affinities. This mechanism explains paradoxical experimental observations in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including non-monotonic dependence of signaling output on ligand affinity and kinase activity. Given the ubiquity of multi-site phosphorylation and ligand-induced degradation across signaling receptors, we propose that kinetic sorting may be a general non-equilibrium ligand-discrimination strategy used by multiple signaling receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104896">Axonal injury signaling is restrained by a spared synaptic branch</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic ability of injured neurons to degenerate and regenerate their axons facilitates nervous system repair; however, this ability is not engaged in all neurons and injury locations. Here, we investigate the regulation of a conserved axonal injury response pathway with respect to the location of damage in branched motoneuron (MN) axons in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. The dileucine zipper kinase (DLK; also known as MAP3K12 in mammals and Wallenda (Wnd) in <i>Drosophila</i>) is a key regulator of diverse responses to axonal injury. In three different populations of MNs, we observed the same striking result that Wnd/DLK signaling becomes activated only in response to injuries that remove all synaptic terminals. Injuries that spared even a small part of a synaptic terminal were insufficient to activate Wnd/DLK signaling, despite the presence of extensive axonal degeneration. The regulation of injury-induced Wnd/DLK signaling occurs independently of its previously known regulator, the Hiw/PHR ubiquitin ligase. We propose that Wnd/DLK signaling regulation is linked to the trafficking of a synapse-to-nucleus axonal cargo and that this mechanism enables neurons to respond to impairments in synaptic connectivity.

">Global organisation of structural covariance networks derived from parcellated cortical surface area in atypical populations.</a></h4>

              
                Higher-order features of brain organisation are powerful measures for understanding the relationship between brain and experience. In particular, the global arrangement of structural features of the cortex provides insight into neurodevelopmental processes that underlie individual differences in perception and cognition. Structural covariance networks (SCNs), which capture regional coordination of brain morphometry, are an efficient method to derive global properties of the cortex. However, their interpretation relies on an array of methodological choices that are often inconsistent between studies. Using a hierarchically-clustered version of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, we constructed SCNs of regional cortical surface area for groups with four different conditions -- synaesthesia, autism, early psychosis, and anxiety or depression -- and compared global network properties with those of age- and sex-matched controls. SCNs for synaesthesia and autism showed globally stronger connectivity, with specific increases at moderate cortical distances, as well as lower network complexity. Conversely, the SCN for early psychosis showed a globally lower connectivity and a greater complexity, while depression and anxiety showed few differences compared to controls. The results for autism and depression were replicated across two datasets each. These findings support the notion that synaesthesia and autism share neurodevelopmental mechanisms, while psychosis may involve a diverging process. This study is also an important proof of principle for analysing diverse populations under one methodological framework.

">Natural Scene Coding Consistency in Genetically-Defined Cell Populations</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how genetically-defined cell populations encode visual information remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. While extensive research has characterized individual cell responses to simple stimuli such as static gratings, the population-level coding principles that govern naturalistic visual processing across cell types remain largely unexplored. We analyzed population responses from 43,018 neurons across 12 genetically-defined cell types in 243 mice from the Allen Brain Observatory, comparing representational geometry between natural scenes and static gratings. We found that inhibitory cell populations (VIP, SST, PV) cluster distinctly in representational space almost independent of anatomical location when responding to natural scenes but not static gratings, suggesting preserved cell-type specific computational functions specific for natural scenes. To assess coding capacity of a population of neurons, we developed Inter-Individual Representational Similarity (IIRS), which measures consistency of neural representations across different individuals in response to an ensemble of stimuli. All inhibitory populations showed significantly higher IIRS for natural scenes compared to static gratings, indicating consistent encoding of naturalistic visual features across individuals comparable to excitatory populations (Cux2, Rorb, Rbp4). Parallel analysis of neural networks trained on natural images (ImageNet) with different random initializations revealed similar patterns: models showed higher cross-initialization similarity for naturalistic stimuli compared to static gratings, suggesting that cross-individual consistency emerges when experimental stimuli engage the features that neural circuits are adapted to extract. These findings establish IIRS as a metric for identifying coding capacity in cell populations and reveal that inhibitory cell populations encode consistent aspects of natural scenes across individuals, indicating these circuits may have evolved specialized tuning for naturalistic visual environments.

">Extracellular space diffusion modelling identifies distinct functional advantages of archetypical glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse geometries</a></h4>

              
                The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a convoluted compartment of nano- and microscale interconnected ducts. A key step in signaling between neural cells is diffusion of signaling molecules through the ECS, yet, signaling is generally considered solely from the stance of cells and their properties. Where ECS diffusion is addressed, this is commonly done using volume-averaging techniques blind to individual signaling events and ECS geometry. We hypothesized that ECS geometry can shape local diffusion and thereby tune signaling arising from point-sources. To access the scale of individual transmitter release events and synapse geometries, we developed a computational diffusion model, DifFlux, based on super-resolved images of hippocampal ECS in live mouse brain slices and combined this with single molecule Monte Carlo diffusion simulations. Our approach allows us to simulate diffusion of molecules of our choosing in true live ECS geometries. We asked how the ECS shapes local diffusion in dense neuropil and along larger cellular processes in CA1 stratum radiatum. We observed local diffusional anisotropy and directionality imposed by ECS geometry. Further, we identified distinct functional advantages of dendritic spine and somatodendritic synapse ECS geometries, shedding light on the longstanding conundrum of why glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are so conspicuously morphologically different. Our modelling broadly identifies ECS structure as a direct modulator of extrasynaptic signaling that can operate in parallel to conventional regulation mechanisms.

">Microglia coordinate activity-dependent protein synthesis in neurons through metabolic coupling</a></h4>

              
                De novo protein synthesis is required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity and memory, but it comes with a great metabolic cost. In the mammalian brain, it remains unclear which cell types and biological mechanisms are critical for sensing and responding to increased metabolic demand. Here we demonstrate that microglia, resident macrophages of the brain, coordinate metabolic coupling between endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons to fuel protein synthesis in active neurons. Increasing metabolic demand via a motor task stimulates microglia to secrete the hypoxia-responsive protein CYR61, increasing glucose transporter expression in brain vasculature. Depleting microglia reduces training-induced metabolic fluxes and neuronal protein synthesis, which can be reproduced by blocking CYR61 signaling. Thus, we define a neuroimmune metabolic circuit required for on-demand protein synthesis in mouse motor cortex.

">Frontal and Parietal Contributions to Proprioception and Motor Skill Learning</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill learning is the process of developing new movements with practice until they can be performed automatically. This necessitates the interaction of high-level cognitive processes with low-level sensorimotor mechanisms. Skill learning involves not only changes in the motor system but also proprioception (position sense). Proprioceptive deficits increase variability and decrease accuracy of movement. The somatosensory cortex, where low-level proprioception is processed, is known to play a role in motor skill learning, but the involvement of higher-level proprioceptive regions is unclear. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked to the high-level early stages of motor learning, and indirectly to proprioception. Supramarginal gyrus (SMG), an interface area between motor and sensory cortices, has been linked to higher-order proprioceptive processing. In this study, we asked how activity in DLPFC and SMG influences motor skill learning. Participants learned an upper limb motor skill designed to be spatially complex and dependent on proprioception: tracing a two-dimensional maze as accurately as possible within the desired speed range, using a Kinarm Endpoint robotic manipulandum. Proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity and bias) was assessed before and after continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) was applied to inhibit activity in DLPFC, SMG, or Sham. To measure motor skill, movement accuracy and variability were examined at the trained speed as well as at a faster (more difficult) and a slower (easier) speed. Skill was assessed before and after cTBS, after 40 training trials (early learning) and after another 80 trials (late learning). All three groups showed improvements in movement accuracy and variance, indicating they learned the maze tracing skill. However, the Sham group improved movement variability at the faster speed significantly more than the DLPFC or SMG groups did. This suggests that DLPFC and SMG are important for the more challenging aspects of motor skill learning, consistent with their association with higher-level proprioceptive function.

                Small vessel disease (SVD) impacts healthy aging of organs across the body, yet its contributions to adverse brain aging remain poorly defined. Here we show thromboinflammation, a core feature of SVD, as a driver of adverse brain aging. We identify cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen as a marker of brain thromboinflammation and screen neurovascular biosignatures mediating its impact on synaptic vulnerability along the full spectrum of brain aging from cognitively typical, amyloid-negative to cognitively impaired, amyloid-positive older adults. We identified 53 proteins mediating the effect of fibrinogen on synaptic markers in 1,655 donors from three independent cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic mapping revealed mediator enrichment in neurovascular unit cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated dysregulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune signaling. Vascular and microglial-enriched biosignatures associated with compromised white matter integrity. These findings implicate thromboinflammation as an early, amyloid-independent pathway to neurodegeneration and tauopathy, establishing vascular health as fundamental to preserving brain healthspan.

">The Neuroprotective Effects of Ocimum gratissimum-Supplemented Diet on Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative illness primarily caused by the buildup of amyloid plaque, which is brought on by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Currently, therapeutic agents are focused on addressing clinical symptoms with associated side effects. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective potential of Ocimum gratissimum, a plant known for its richness in bioactive compounds. By investigating its effects on cognitive health, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding dietary interventions for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-six animals were divided into six groups of six mice each: the control group received distilled water intraperitoneally; the scopolamine group received only scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); the three test groups were fed 5%, 10%, and 20% Ocimum gratissimum-supplemented diets while also receiving scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); and the positive control group received Donepezil (5 mg/kg) followed by the injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Donepezil was administered orally 30 minutes before the scopolamine injection. All treatments were administered daily for 14 consecutive days. Results: The supplemented diet groups showed significantly improved spatial memory and navigation compared to the scopolamine-only group. Biochemical analyses revealed that O. gratissimum mitigated scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, with marked improvements in antioxidant enzyme levels, reduced lipid peroxidation, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Dietary intervention using Ocimum gratissimum leaf was able to improve spatial memory and protect against memory impairment, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.

">Ultrafast fMRI detects age-related changes in harmonics of cardiac pulsations in the brain at 7 T</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To develop and apply an ultra-fast fMRI acquisition at 7 T to measure the pulsatile signals in the brain with full brain coverage and detect age-related differences. Pulsatile signals' parameters provide information about the health status of the cerebrovascular system. This new acquisition provides a good mix of spatial coverage, image resolution, and temporal resolution for observing physiological signals. Methods: A partial separability MRI acquisition and reconstruction approach was used to collect 3D data acquired at 7 T with TR = 65 ms in 28 healthy adults. 8 young subjects and 14 older subjects (10 male and 12 female) had acceptable pulse plethysmography and MRI data. With full-brain coverage and 2 mm isotropic resolution, the reliability of the pulse signal (even/odd heartbeat as test/retest) within each brain voxel was computed across subjects. Within voxels of high pulse reliability, the average magnitude within 0.15 Hz of the 4 heartbeat harmonic frequencies were compared within CSF, GM, and WM between young/old and between male/female participants. Results: Increased first harmonic magnitude in older adults compared to young adults was detected in regions with reliable cardiac pulsations, which overlap major arteries and CSF pools. There was also a greater magnitude of the third harmonic normalized to the first in males. Brain maps of the pulse frequency and the harmonics were formed for visualization of regions of high pulsatility. Conclusion: This new approach captures the pulsatile signal with BOLD fMRI with high spatiotemporal resolution and can be sensitive to age- and sex-related differences.

">Mid-level visual features engage V4 to support sparse object recognition under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Cortical visual prostheses have long promised to restore sight by directly stimulating the visual cortex, but current approaches remain limited. Conventional V1-targeted implants evoke isolated phosphenes that rarely support coherent object recognition, largely due to the sparse electrode arrays feasible for implantation. Here we examined whether mid-level features, specifically curve segments associated with area V4, provide a more efficient substrate for artificial vision. Using fMRI, 24 participants performed an object recognition task with stimuli fragmented into either phosphene-like dots or curve segments at graded densities. Behaviorally, curve segments enabled recognition at lower density thresholds than phosphenes, yielding steeper psychometric slopes and higher accuracy. Neuroimaging revealed that while both fragment types engaged V1, only curve segments recruited V4, and correct recognition of segments relative to phosphenes elicited widespread responses across temporal, parietal, and insular cortices. Mediation analyses further showed that recognition from phosphenes relied on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) involvement with higher stimulus uncertainty, whereas segment-based recognition depended primarily on visual cortex. Together, these results demonstrate that mid-level feature fragments confer both perceptual and neural advantages over phosphenes, reducing reliance on downstream uncertainty resolution. V4 thus emerges as a promising target for next-generation cortical prostheses, offering a path toward sparser yet more informative stimulation strategies.

">Gaze Graphs in spatial navigation: visual behavior during free exploration explains individual differences in navigation performance</a></h4>

              
                Vision is an important sense for spatial navigation, yet little is known about the role of visual behavior during spatial knowledge acquisition and its link to spatial navigation performance. In this study, participants freely explored the immersive virtual reality city of Westbrook while eye-tracking data were collected. Subsequently, participants' spatial knowledge was tested in an immersive pointing-to-building task. To address the freedom of movement during the spatial exploration, we transformed the eye-tracking data into gaze graphs and applied a graph-theoretical analysis. We assessed gaze graph architecture and identified gaze-graph-defined landmarks, finding that their properties were consistent with key results from our earlier work. Furthermore, we investigated which factors contribute to the observed individual differences in spatial navigation performance. We found that global gaze graph measures, specifically gaze graph diameter, could explain 40% of the observed individual differences in participants' mean task performance. In comparison, a model based on participants' responses to a self-report questionnaire was not predictive of such differences. Consequently, we suggest that visual behavior, as reflected in global gaze graph measures, is a strong predictor of individual performance differences. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of landmarks and individual differences in spatial navigation but also outline the potential of vision and gaze-graph-based spatial navigation research.

">Palmitoylation of death receptor p75NTR contributes to Alzheimer's Disease progression by regulating APP trafficking and degradation</a></h4>

              
                Although protein palmitoylation has been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it remains unclear whether or how palmitoylation of specific proteins contributes to any of the pathological features of AD. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contributes to AD progression by regulating the intracellular trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). p75NTR is palmitoylated at a juxtamembrane cysteine but it is currently unknown whether this has any effect on its role in AD. Here, we report that 5xFAD mice, an animal model of AD, expressing a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of p75NTR (p75C281A) display significantly attenuated neuropathology and cognitive deficits. p75C281A showed enhanced internalization, trafficking to Rab5/Rab7 endosomes and lysosomal-mediated degradation. In mutant p75C281A neurons, APP displayed accelerated co-internalization with p75NTR, increased trafficking to late endosomes and lysosome, and enhanced degradation, thereby limiting neuronal Abeta; production. Interestingly, the brain of 5xFAD mice shows increased levels of p75NTR palmitoylation. These results indicate that palmitoylation of p75NTR enhances its stability and, indirectly, that of APP by reducing their trafficking to the lysosome, resulting in increased Abeta; accumulation and neuropathology in the AD brain. Selective inhibitors of p75NTR palmitoylation may find applications in the treatment of AD.

">Non-invasive prediction of conduction velocities in the human brain from MRI-derived microstructure features at 7 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                The conduction velocity of neuronal signals along axons is a key neurophysiological property that can be altered in various disease processes. While cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) can be measured in presurgical assessment to provide information about conduction delay between a subset of brain regions, it is currently not possible to efficiently and systematically estimate conduction velocity in vivo across the whole brain. Given the established link between conduction velocity and axon morphology (most notably axon diameter but also myelination), mapping a reliable and quantitative metric linked to axon properties could fill the gap of inferring conduction velocity across the entire human brain. By integrating multiple MRI-derived microstructural measures - including axon radius, axonal water fraction, extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity, and longitudinal relaxation time - and conduction velocity estimates obtained from a large database of CCEPs, we developed a whole-brain prediction model of conduction velocity. Our multivariate MRI-based model explained 29% of variance in neurophysiological conduction velocity, making it possible to partially predict whole-brain conduction velocity and delay matrices along connections for which no direct measurement is commonly available from epilepsy surgery investigations. This integrative MRI-based approach could provide a non-invasive framework for comprehensively characterising conduction delays in vivo across the human brain white matter.

">Competing Neural Decision Variables in Human Frontal Cortex Shape Decision Confidence</a></h4>

              
                Mounting evidence indicates that decisions emerge from a competition between populations of neurons encoding the different choice options. Theoretical models propose that the outcome of this competition may shape agents' confidence in their decisions. But measuring the underlying neural dynamics of this competition has so far been challenging. Here, we developed a magnetoencephalography source imaging approach to simultaneously track competing neural decision variables in human frontal cortex during decision formation. This revealed negative intrinsic correlations between decision variables, a signature of intracortical, inhibitory interactions. Both "winning" and "losing" decision variables uniquely contribute to confidence, with a stronger impact of the winner. These asymmetric contributions constrain a dynamical model of decision and confidence formation, which accurately captures several other diagnostic behavioral and neural signatures, including the anti-correlation between decision variables. Our approach opens a new window on the distributed neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and confidence formation.

">Neuronal compartmentalization results in impoverished axonal mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria differ depending on their location within a neuron. Morphological heterogeneity between somatic, dendritic, and axonal mitochondria is well established. Emerging evidence suggests that further specialization is needed to meet the unique demands of different neuronal compartments. However, the molecular and functional diversity of mitochondria within a neuron remains poorly understood. Here, we utilized proteomics in MitoTag mice to profile somatodendritic and axonal mitochondria across four distinct neuron types, thereby generating a compendium of intracellular mitochondrial diversity. Combining proteomics, functional, and immunofluorescence analyses, we demonstrated that axonal mitochondria are not defined by the presence of unique proteins, but rather by the selective loss or preservation of specific pathways compared to their somatodendritic counterparts. This results in impoverished axonal mitochondria, which are characterized by diminished mtDNA expression and impaired oxidative phosphorylation yet retain other pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism. Bioinformatic analyses of multiomic data identified local translation as one mechanism underlying compartment-specific diversity. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive in vivo framework for understanding mitochondrial specialization across neuronal compartments.

">An axon-intrinsic loop restricts nerve regeneration through axonal protein synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Injured axons synthesize the RNA Binding Protein KHSRP that promotes mRNA decay and slows nerve regeneration. Axotomy-induced increase in axoplasmic Ca2+ activates axonal Khsrp translation, and while Ca2+ returns to pre-injury levels within 16 hours post-axotomy, axonal KHSRP remains elevated. Alternating translation of Reg3a and Khsrp sustains axonal KHSRP levels in regenerating axons. Nerve injury activates Reg3a expression, resulting in increased REG3A synthesis and secretion from axons. REG3A stimulates ER Ca2+ release to activate PERK, increase eIF2 phosphorylation, and increase Khsrp translation. Axoplasmic Ca2+ slowly oscillates in growth cones and Reg3A depletion attenuates growth cone Ca2+ oscillations, decreases KHSRP synthesis, reduces the axon,s retractive events, and accelerates peripheral nerve regeneration. Thus, REG3A to KHSRP signaling provides an axon-intrinsic loop that decelerates axon growth through localized mRNA translation.

">Ascending nociceptive pathways drive rapid escape and sustained avoidance in adult Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Nociception -- the detection of harmful stimuli by the nervous system -- contributes to both rapid escape and long-term avoidance behaviors. Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.

">Increased cocaine self-administration and prefrontal cortical dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling in a rat model for sensory processing sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                While all organisms are tuned to the environment, some are more sensitive than others. In humans, this is reflected by the trait sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), which is characterized by heightened emotional reactivity, deeper information processing, greater awareness of their environment, and susceptibility to overstimulation. It is expected but unproven that high SPS increases the risk for psychostimulant use. To clarify this, we selected Wistar rats on behavioral extremes related to SPS and subjected them to isolation, neutral, and enriched housing conditions, followed by cocaine self-administration. Subsequently, we investigated neurobiological differences in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission of the low- and high SPS-like rats by evaluating key glutamatergic and GABAergic proteins in the infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the prefrontal cortex. High SPS-like rats displayed higher cocaine intake during self-administration training sessions in isolated versus social conditions, whereas low SPS-like rats showed similar intake across housing conditions. During extended access self-administration sessions, high SPS-like rats displayed a higher cocaine intake regardless of housing and greater motivation for cocaine under a progressive ratio scheme. High SPS-like cocaine-naive rats exhibited lower expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers in the infra limbic and prelimbic cortex compared to low SPS-like cocaine-naive rats. The opposite occurred after cocaine exposure: low and high SPS-like rats showed lower and higher expression levels, respectively, compared to naive counterparts. In conclusion, these findings suggest that a high SPS-like trait with associated glutamatergic and GABAergic alterations might be a risk factor for the development of cocaine use disorder.

">Tracking Sleep-Linked Brain Fluid Dynamics Using Modified fNIRS: A Novel Noninvasive Window into Glymphatic Function</a></h4>

              
                Background: The glymphatic system, a brain-wide perivascular and interstitial waste and signal transport pathway for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exchange with interstitial fluid (ISF), has pronounced activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury, Alzheimers disease, and mood disorders. However, direct measurement in humans is limited because current imaging methods rely on intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is unsuitable for routine or naturalistic sleep studies. The absence of real-time, noninvasive monitoring methods that allow for natural sleep poses a major barrier to advancing glymphatic research in clinical settings. Methods: To address this barrier, we developed a non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) forehead array in a wearable headband using non-standard wavelengths to allow for better sensitivity for water measurement. We monitored cortical blood and water dynamics during overnight sleep, quantifying oscillatory patterns of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and water across sleep stages within the outer layers of the frontal cortex, subarachnoid space, and scalp. A component of the extracted water metrics is hypothesized to serve as a proxy for glymphatic transport without the need for contrast agents or surgical intervention. Results: Our results demonstrate water concentrations were highest in SWS (d = 1.93, p=0.0002), while HbO concentrations also showed a modest elevation (d = 1.06, ns). Additionally, low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) of both water and HbO signals exhibited distinct dynamics of suprathreshold envelope peak (SEP) frequencies during NREM stages (N2 and N3) as compared to REM and wake, with effect size (d= 1.31, p = 0.003) for water. Interestingly, these water-derived metrics correlate with EEG slow-wave activity, linking fluid-sensitive oscillations to established electrophysiological markers of sleep depth. These findings indicate that water-sensitive oscillatory processes are selectively amplified during deep sleep and scale with EEG-defined sleep depth, consistent with a role for glymphatic-related fluid transport in human sleep. Conclusion: We report novel cortical water shift parameters that are robustly sensitive to sleep stage transitions via a wearable, non-invasive, scalable headband, consistent with predicted glymphatic activity. Future work will cross-validate this method with MRI and other techniques.

">CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation as a mutation-independent therapeutic strategy for SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) regulates synaptic strength and neuronal signaling, with essential roles in cortical development and synaptic plasticity. Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SYNGAP1 cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, and autism. SYNGAP1 mutations often result in haploinsufficiency, providing a strong rationale for gene-targeted therapies. However, no treatment currently addresses the underlying genetic cause of SRID. Here, we developed a CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) approach to upregulate the functional Syngap1 allele in a SRID mouse model. CRISPRa activated Syngap1, normalized SynGAP protein expression and downstream signaling, and rescued working memory deficits. We validated the translational potential of this strategy in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived excitatory cortical neurons. CRISPRa rescued SYNGAP1 in two distinct loss-of-function variant lines. Together, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of mutation-independent transcriptional activation as a therapeutic approach for SRID and its broader applicability to haploinsufficiency disorders.

">Sex-dependent cortico-amygdala circuits controlling emotion recognition</a></h4>

              
                In social species, the ability to recognize others emotional states is essential for appropriate social interactions, yet it often declines with age and is impaired in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. While emotion recognition has been characterized in both humans and rodents, the underlying neural circuits and how they vary by sex and age remain poorly understood. Here, we used a negative Emotional state Discrimination Task (EDT) in TRAP2 transgenic mice to map brain regions engaged during negative emotion recognition in young and aged animals. Young male and female mice successfully discriminated emotionally altered conspecifics, recruiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO) in a sex-specific manner. Fiber photometry revealed distinct activation dynamics in these regions, and chemogenetic inhibition of bidirectional BLA-MO projections abolished emotion recognition in male but not female mice. Notably, young human participants also showed sex-specific recruitment of BLA and OFC during negative facial emotion recognition. Moreover, aging selectively impaired emotion recognition in male mice, coinciding with reduced BLA activity. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of BLA in aged male mice rescued this deficit. Together, these findings identify a sex-dependent BLA-MO circuit as a conserved neural substrate for emotion recognition and demonstrate that age-related impairments can be reversed through targeted circuit-level intervention.

">ADHD-like traits reshape the balance between inhibitory control and predictive processes</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior relies on a dynamic balance between flexible, goal-directed control and efficient, automatic processes. This equilibrium is often disrupted in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition understood to exist along a continuum of traits in the general population. While ADHD is consistently linked to response inhibition deficits, its relationship with statistical learning (a mechanism for habit learning) and, crucially, the interaction between these functions, remains underexplored. Here, using a novel paradigm in a non-clinical sample of university students (n = 226), we investigated how ADHD-like traits modulate the interplay between response inhibition and statistical learning. We found that higher ADHD-like traits were associated with poorer response inhibition, confirming previous research. Importantly, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between inhibition and statistical learning, where weaker inhibitory control typically led to enhanced learning of environmental regularities. However, this learning advantage progressively diminished across the ADHD trait continuum, becoming markedly reduced in individuals with high symptom prevalence. These findings provide novel evidence that ADHD-like traits influence not only isolated neurocognitive processes but also their dynamic interaction, highlighting a spectrum-based mechanism that may underlie the transition from adaptive variability to maladaptive behavioral patterns. This work advocates for a dimensional approach to ADHD, emphasizing early detection and targeted interventions for individuals with varying levels of symptomatic expression, broadening support beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries.

">Neural population dynamics of direct electrical stimulation of neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial electrical stimulation is foundational in neuroscience and clinical neuromodulation, yet how applied electrical fields engage neural tissue and influences perception remains unclear. Using three orthogonal Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we recorded extracellular voltages and spikes with sub-millisecond resolution in three dimensions around a stimulation source. The evoked potential extended asymmetrically and grew sub-linearly with amplitude, influenced by anatomical heterogeneity. Increasing amplitude increased the density, but not spatial extent, of directly responsive neurons, but fewer than 5% of neurons within the evoked potential were activated. Fast-spiking interneurons were recruited nearer the source, whereas pyramidal neurons showed anisotropic activation. Direct responses were polarity- and amplitude-selective. Sparse direct spiking drove large, asymmetric cortical responses and modulated >50% of neurons at higher amplitudes. Perceptually, mice weakly detected single pulses, and performance did not improve with amplitude. Thus, anatomy and spatiotemporal patterning - not spike counts - govern physiological and perceptual impact, informing biomimetic, multi-contact prostheses.

">Cholinergic heterogeneity facilitates synchronization and information flow in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                The human brain displays substantial regional variability in molecular, anatomical, and physiological organization. Yet, how this heterogeneity shapes large-scale neuronal dynamics remains poorly understood. To address this question, we employed a biologically informed whole-brain computational model capable of generating distinct brain states, from awake-like to sleep-like regimes. Our model was constrained by empirical human structural connectivity and spatial maps of cholinergic receptor gene expression, thereby embedding regional neuromodulatory variability into a macroscopic framework. We found that incorporating cholinergic heterogeneity had a significant impact on brain dynamics: it not only facilitated network synchronization but also enhanced information flow between brain regions. Furthermore, we addressed a particularly intricate dynamic regime characterized by the coexistence of localized sleep-like activity within otherwise awake-like states. We showed that the emergence of these slow waves was a byproduct of both regional levels of neuronal adaptation and structural connectivity. In summary, our findings highlight the critical role of molecular and anatomical heterogeneity in shaping global brain dynamics, suggesting new avenues for linking microscale diversity to macroscale function.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metacognition enables adaptive behavior through the self-evaluation of our cognitions. An unresolved question is whether metacognition relies on domain-general or domain-specific mechanisms. The domain-general account proposes that shared prefrontal resources support metacognition across all cognitive functions. This predicts that metacognitive abilities should correlate across cognitive tasks and show uniform age-related decline, as aging would affect this shared system. However, behavioral results show inconsistent cross-domain correlations and age-related decline, often confounded by methodological differences between tasks. The neural oscillations supporting metacognition also remain unclear, though electroencephalography (EEG) studies suggest theta oscillations as a potential mechanism in specific domains. No study has compared both behavioral and oscillatory patterns across domains using matched tasks. We addressed this by recording EEG from younger and older-adults during matched perceptual and visual short-term memory tasks. Despite equivalent task performance, aging selectively impaired metacognition in perception and not memory, revealing behavioral decoupling between domains. This dissociation was mirrored in oscillatory dynamics. Younger adults showed stronger occipital theta-synchronization supporting perceptual metacognition, while older adults engaged compensatory frontal beta-desynchronization. During memory, older adults’ metacognition was supported by occipital alpha-desynchronization. These findings reveal the domain-specific oscillatory mechanisms supporting metacognition, each tuned to computational demands of the cognitive domain and age-group.</span>

                <p>Loss-of-function (LOF) Frazzled/DCC mutants disrupt synaptogenesis in the Giant Fiber (GF) System of <I>Drosophila</I>. We observed weaker physiology in LOF male and female specimens, characterized by longer latencies and reduced response frequencies between the GFs and the motor neurons. These physiological phenotypes are linked to a loss of gap junctions in the GFs, specifically the loss of the shaking-B(neural+16) isoform of innexin in the presynaptic terminal. We present evidence of Frazzled's role in gap junction regulation by utilizing the UAS-GAL4 system in <I>Drosophila</I> to rescue mutant phenotypes. Expression of various UAS-Frazzled constructs in a Frazzled LOF background was used to dissect the role of different parts of the Frazzled receptor in the assembly of electrical synapses. Expressing Frazzled&rsquo;s intracellular domain in Frazzled LOF mutants rescued axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis. This is supported by the complementary result that Frazzled fails to rescue synaptic function when the transcriptional activation domain is disrupted, as shown by the deletion of the highly conserved intracellular P3 domain or by a construct with a point mutation in the highly conserved P3 domain known to be required for transcriptional activation. A computational model clarifies the role of gap junctions and the function of the GF System. The present work shows how various domains of a guidance molecule regulate synaptogenesis through the regulation of synaptic components.</p>

                <p>Sleep&ndash;wake states bidirectionally interact with epilepsy and seizures, but the mechanisms are unknown. A barrier to comprehensive characterization and the study of mechanisms has been the difficulty of annotating large chronic recording datasets. To overcome this barrier, we sought to develop an automated method of classifying sleep&ndash;wake states, seizures, and the postictal state in mice ranging from controls to mice with severe epilepsy with accompanying background electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities. We utilized a large dataset of recordings, including electromyogram, EEG, and hippocampal local field potentials, from control and intra-amygdala kainic acid-treated mice. We found that an existing sleep&ndash;wake classifier performed poorly, even after retraining. A support vector machine, relying on typically used scoring parameters, also performed below our benchmark. We then trained and evaluated several multilayer neural network architectures and found that a bidirectional long short-term memory&ndash;based model performed best. This "Sleep&ndash;Wake and Ictal State Classifier" (SWISC) showed high agreement between ground-truth and classifier scores for all sleep and seizure states in an unseen and unlearned epileptic dataset (average agreement 96.41% &plusmn; SD 3.80%) and saline animals (97.77 &plusmn; 1.40%). Channel dropping showed that SWISC was primarily dependent on hippocampal signals yet still maintained good performance (~90% agreement) with EEG alone, thereby expanding the classifier's applicability to other epilepsy datasets. SWISC enables the efficient combined scoring of sleep&ndash;wake and seizure states in mouse models of epilepsy and healthy controls, facilitating comprehensive and mechanistic studies of sleep&ndash;wake and biological rhythms in epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Thirst is a strongly motivated internal state that is represented in central brain circuits that are only partially understood. Water seeking is a discrete step of the thirst behavioral sequence that is amenable to uncovering the mechanisms for motivational properties such as goal-oriented behavior, value encoding, and behavioral competition. In <I>Drosophila</I>, water seeking is regulated by the NPY-like neuropeptide NPF; however, the circuitry for NPF-dependent water seeking is unknown. To uncover the downstream circuitry, we identified the NPF receptor NPFR and the neurons it is expressed in as being acutely critical for thirsty water seeking in males. Refinement of the NPFR pattern uncovered a role for a single neuron, the L1-l, in promoting thirsty water seeking. The L1-l neuron increases its activity in thirsty flies and is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons in long-term memory formation. Thus, NPFR and its ligand NPF, already known for its role in feeding behavior, are also important for a second ingestive behavior.</p>

                <p>The ability to inhibit and adapt our behavior in response to changing stimuli is a critical component of everyday life. Individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) may struggle to inhibit behavior, particularly in the presence of dopaminergic therapy, which can result in impulsive behavior. Impulse control disorders are often operationalized in the laboratory using motor inhibition tasks. However, deficits of motor inhibition tasks are not always observed in PD, perhaps because of the nature of the motor inhibition that is engaged in typical tasks (e.g., suppression of incipient movement such as a button press). We employed a novel continuous movement stop task to investigate planned and unplanned motor inhibition during ongoing movement. EEG was recorded during task performance from individuals with PD (OFF and ON dopaminergic medication) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Participants were of any sex. We found that the time it took for participants to stop a continuous movement was impaired (i.e., longer) in PD patients ON medication compared with both patients OFF medication and HC. This finding was accompanied by diminished midfrontal theta power following the stop signal in PD (ON and OFF) compared with HC. Additionally, an increase in midfrontal beta power was observed, which was higher in unplanned stopping compared with planned for all groups. However, this increase in beta occurred late&mdash;after the time of outright stopping. Together, these findings demonstrate that stopping ongoing movements was impaired in PD patients ON medication and theta and beta power play distinct roles in inhibition of movement.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Signs of awareness after acute severe brain injury are critical for informing goals-of-care decisions, ranging from the continuation of aggressive life-sustaining therapy to comfort-focused end-of-life measures. However, awareness may go undetected in some critically ill patients when assessed using bedside behavioral neurological examination. Here, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify covert awareness in acute brain injured patients who are unable to follow behavioral commands.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, consecutive cross-sectional study of 32 critically ill patients in a single intensive care unit (ICU). All had acute brain injuries from various causes and lacked behavioral command-following on bedside examination, as determined by using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, an optical bedside neuroimaging technique, we assessed brain activity while patients were instructed to perform a mental imagery task in which a positive response was dependent upon preserved awareness. We referred to this phenomenon as covert awareness.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 32 acutely brain injured patients (mean age = 63, ± 12 years, 15 females), 8 (25%) were able to willfully modulate their brain activity when instructed to imagine playing a game of tennis—providing evidence of covert awareness despite no observable behavioral signs that this was the case. We found no association between covert awareness and 3-month functional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy detected preserved consciousness in 25% of patients who lacked behavioral command following in an intensive care setting. This finding highlights the need for further research to assess the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques in the clinical assessment of critically ill patients. Such methods could ensure that goals of care decisions are based on a more accurate understanding of a patient's level of awareness. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
