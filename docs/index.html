              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protofibril formation: decreased total glutathione concentration as an early indicator of neuron damage in the brainstems of Wistar rats treated with rotenone [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rotenone treatment causes oxidative stress in neurons and forms the basis of animal models of Parkinson's disease. The reduced form of glutathione is predicted to detoxify rotenone from neurons in the brainstem. This study aims to measure the concentration of total glutathione and analyze the formation of protofibril in the brainstem of Wistar rats treated with rotenone. Methods: Seventy-two male Wistar rats aged 8–9 weeks weighing 200–250 g were divided into two investigations: total glutathione determination and protofibril analysis. The independent variables were treatment group, observation time, and location in the brainstem. The dependent variables were the concentration of total glutathione and protofibril density. Results: The concentration of total glutathione was not significantly different among treatment groups (p: 0.084), observation time (p: 0.608), or the location in the brainstem (p: 0.372). Protofibril density was different in the treatment groups (p: 0.001), observation time (p: 0.001), and between the upper and lower brainstem (p: 0.001). Rotenone treatment subcortically induced the concentration of total glutathione in the brainstem to decrease, but protofibril density tended to increase. Conclusions: The total glutathione concentration is inversely proportional to protofibril density. Total glutathione might be an early marker of neuronal damage.

                Background: The medical student is a part of education that has a pivotal role in contributing to the teaching-learning process. Assessing the learning process by student perception can give valuable input to predict academic achievement. This study aims to identify the student’s perspective regarding teaching-learning behaviour and which factor most influences academic achievement. Methods: A total of 443 medical students of the preclinical phase were selected to participate in this study. Design of the study comprised three single-groups time sequences with the observational approach. This study is divided into three phases: item construction by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), validation through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and true surveys. Sample size calculation employed formulation of subject to item ratio for EFA and CFA; true survey utilized the estimate proportion population. Using regression linear, we determine the most influential factor to academic performance. Results: Results were summarized following two factors that influencing academic performance, namely learning experience (p value=0.013, r=0.041) and exam effectiveness (p value=0.041, r=0.028). Our work highlights the lecturer capacity and integrated module have contributed the academic success (79.46% and 77.80%). Conclusions: Our finding has novelty in which contribute the knowledge regarding exam significance on medicine. Meanwhile, related to the learning experience domain is increasingly proving an essential factor to achieve academic performance. The major strength of this study is the systematic manner in which it was conducted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous: a case-control study at a single UK National Health Service trust [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We first examined the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous. Second, we examined the concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes. Methods: This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework. Results: Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls (χ2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001). Conclusions: In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.

                Background: COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for health services and systems around the world, including Peru.  A viable alternative in the telemedicine field to guarantee patient nutritional care is telenutrition. Telenutrition involves the interactive use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to implement the nutrition care process with patients at a remote location. Information regarding the experience with this methodology and its potential effect on patients’ nutritional goals, does not exist in Peru. The aim of the study was to report the effect of the evaluation type (telenutrition vs. in-person) on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and relative fat mass (RFM) in overweight and obese adult patients.  Methods: This retrospective study included 100 eligible patients in a single nutritional center, from January 2019 to March 2021. Telenutrition and in-person continuous variables were compared with independent sample t-test or U Mann-Whitney test. Results: There were significant differences in weight, BMI, WC and RFM by the end of follow-up period, in both evaluation modalities. Patients on the telenutrition group had a mean decrease of 6.80 ± 4.87 cm in WC, whereas the mean difference observed for the in-person group was 6.74 ± 4.55 cm. There were no significant differences in the changes of any anthropometric parameters when comparing both systems. Reductions were observed in weight (5.93 ± 3.88 kg vs. 4.92 ± 3.29 kg), BMI (2.23 ± 1.39 kg/ m2 vs. 1.83 ± 1.23 kg/ m2), WC (6.80 ± 4.87 cm vs. 6.74 ± 4.55 cm) and RFM (2.43 ± 1.78 vs. 2.63 ± 1.73) in telenutrition and in-person evaluation, respectively by the end of the follow-up period.  Conclusions: Telenutrition may be regarded as an alternative to in-person evaluation offering anthropometric changes and nutritional goals similar to those reported through the in-person modality, in overweight and obese adult people.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Intriguing effects of selection intensity on the evolution of prosocial behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex McAvoy, Andrew Rao, Christoph Hauert</p>

In many models of evolving populations, genetic drift has an outsized role relative to natural selection, or vice versa. While there are many scenarios in which one of these two assumptions is reasonable, intermediate balances between these forces are also biologically relevant. In this study, we consider some natural axioms for modeling intermediate selection intensities, and we explore how to quantify the long-term evolutionary dynamics of such a process. To illustrate the sensitivity of evolutionary dynamics to drift and selection, we show that there can be a “sweet spot” for the balance of these two forces, with sufficient noise for rare mutants to become established and sufficient selection to spread. This balance allows prosocial traits to evolve in evolutionary models that were previously thought to be unconducive to the emergence and spread of altruistic behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of selection intensity on long-run evolutionary outcomes in these settings, such as when there is global competition for reproduction, can be highly non-monotonic. Although intermediate selection intensities (neither weak nor strong) are notoriously difficult to study analytically, they are often biologically relevant; and the results we report suggest that they can elicit novel and rich dynamics in the evolution of prosocial behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating repeat spectra and genome length from low-coverage genome skims with RESPECT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shahab Sarmashghi, Metin Balaban, Eleonora Rachtman, Behrouz Touri, Siavash Mirarab, Vineet Bafna</p>

The cost of sequencing the genome is dropping at a much faster rate compared to assembling and finishing the genome. The use of lightly sampled genomes (genome-skims) could be transformative for genomic ecology, and results using <i>k</i>-mers have shown the advantage of this approach in identification and phylogenetic placement of eukaryotic species. Here, we revisit the basic question of estimating genomic parameters such as genome length, coverage, and repeat structure, focusing specifically on estimating the <i>k</i>-mer repeat spectrum. We show using a mix of theoretical and empirical analysis that there are fundamental limitations to estimating the <i>k</i>-mer spectra due to ill-conditioned systems, and that has implications for other genomic parameters. We get around this problem using a novel constrained optimization approach (Spline Linear Programming), where the constraints are learned empirically. On reads simulated at 1X coverage from 66 genomes, our method, REPeat SPECTra Estimation (RESPECT), had < 1.5% error in length estimation compared to 34% error previously achieved. In shotgun sequenced read samples with contaminants, RESPECT length estimates had median error 4%, in contrast to other methods that had median error 80%. Together, the results suggest that low-pass genomic sequencing can yield reliable estimates of the length and repeat content of the genome. The RESPECT software will be publicly available at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_shahab-2Dsarmashghi_RESPECT.git&d=DwIGAw&c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&r=ZozViWvD1E8PorCkfwYKYQMVKFoEcqLFm4Tg49XnPcA&m=f-xS8GMHKckknkc7Xpp8FJYw_ltUwz5frOw1a5pJ81EpdTOK8xhbYmrN4ZxniM96&s=717o8hLR1JmHFpRPSWG6xdUQTikyUjicjkipjFsKG4w&e=.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Causal inference regulates audiovisual spatial recalibration via its influence on audiovisual perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fangfang Hong, Stephanie Badde, Michael S. Landy</p>

To obtain a coherent perception of the world, our senses need to be in alignment. When we encounter misaligned cues from two sensory modalities, the brain must infer which cue is faulty and recalibrate the corresponding sense. We examined whether and how the brain uses cue reliability to identify the miscalibrated sense by measuring the audiovisual ventriloquism aftereffect for stimuli of varying visual reliability. To adjust for modality-specific biases, visual stimulus locations were chosen based on perceived alignment with auditory stimulus locations for each participant. During an audiovisual recalibration phase, participants were presented with bimodal stimuli with a fixed perceptual spatial discrepancy; they localized one modality, cued after stimulus presentation. Unimodal auditory and visual localization was measured before and after the audiovisual recalibration phase. We compared participants’ behavior to the predictions of three models of recalibration: (a) Reliability-based: each modality is recalibrated based on its relative reliability—less reliable cues are recalibrated more; (b) Fixed-ratio: the degree of recalibration for each modality is fixed; (c) Causal-inference: recalibration is directly determined by the discrepancy between a cue and its estimate, which in turn depends on the reliability of both cues, and inference about how likely the two cues derive from a common source. Vision was hardly recalibrated by audition. Auditory recalibration by vision changed idiosyncratically as visual reliability decreased: the extent of auditory recalibration either decreased monotonically, peaked at medium visual reliability, or increased monotonically. The latter two patterns cannot be explained by either the reliability-based or fixed-ratio models. Only the causal-inference model of recalibration captures the idiosyncratic influences of cue reliability on recalibration. We conclude that cue reliability, causal inference, and modality-specific biases guide cross-modal recalibration indirectly by determining the perception of audiovisual stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard Li, Ajay Ranipeta, John Wilshire, Jeremy Malczyk, Michelle Duong, Robert Guralnick, Adam Wilson, Walter Jetz</p>

A vast range of research applications in biodiversity sciences requires integrating primary species, genetic, or ecosystem data with other environmental data. This integration requires a consideration of the spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the data and processes in question. But a versatile and scale flexible environmental annotation of biodiversity data remains constrained by technical hurdles. Existing tools have streamlined the intersection of occurrence records with gridded environmental data but have remained limited in their ability to address a range of spatial and temporal grains, especially for large datasets. We present the Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool (STOAT), a cloud-based toolbox for flexible biodiversity–environment annotations. STOAT is optimized for large biodiversity datasets and allows user-specified spatial and temporal resolution and buffering in support of environmental characterizations that account for the uncertainty and scale of data and of relevant processes. The tool offers these services for a growing set of near global, remotely sensed, or modeled environmental data, including Landsat, MODIS, EarthEnv, and CHELSA. STOAT includes a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that provides tools for annotation task management and result visualization, linked to Map of Life, and a dedicated R package (<i>rstoat</i>) for programmatic access. We demonstrate STOAT functionality with several examples that illustrate phenological variation and spatial and temporal scale dependence of environmental characteristics of birds at a continental scale. We expect STOAT to facilitate broader exploration and assessment of the scale dependence of observations and processes in ecology.

                Background: In this study, the effect of receiving a non-trivial cash grant and mentorship for business practice on individual earnings in Afghanistan was assessed.  Methods: This randomized control trial (RCT) included 2177 individuals (n=2177), with the age range of 18-35 years. The amount of cash grant (500 USD) was approximately equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the country.  By a process of lottery, eligible applicants were equally divided into the group that received the grant (treatment group) and the group that did not (control group). Results: Almost two years after this study, the percentage of increased annual income to the size of this cash grant was approximately 173 % and 69 % for males and females, respectively. This result was much higher than the estimated percentage reported in previous literature assessing the effect of microfinance loans and cash grants in other countries.  The treatment group had 7% higher probability of having an officially registered business than the control group. The treatment group also increased labor supply and employed additional workers, compared to the control group. The male treatment group bought more capital equipment (e.g., trike and commercial carts) than the male control group, while the female treatment group bought more domestic animals. Conclusion: A non-trivial cash grant has a strong positive effect on the earnings of the recipient of the cash grant in Afghanistan. If the state of increased income continues for the next few years, the sum of increased income will be more than the sum of the administration cost, the interest cost and the amount of cash grant given.  This implies that the project passes the standard criteria to determine the appropriateness of government program. Additionally, we did not find any economically and statistically significant positive effect of mentorship on income.

In MS, inflammatory attacks against myelin, proposed to be autoimmune, cause myelin decay and oligodendrocyte loss, leaving neurons vulnerable. Current therapies target the prominent neuroinflammation but are mostly ineffective in protecting from neurodegeneration and the progressive neurological disability. People with MS have substantially higher levels of extracellular glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter. This impairs cellular homeostasis to cause excitotoxic stress. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) could preserve myelin or allow its recovery by protecting cells from the resulting excessive excitability. This review evaluates the role of excitotoxic stress, myelination and BK channels in MS pathology, and explores the hypothesis that BK channel activation could be a therapeutic strategy to protect oligodendrocytes from excitotoxic stress in MS. This could reduce progression of neurological disability if used in parallel to immunomodulatory therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An examination of determinants for e-wallet adoption in Malaysia: a combined approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this era of innovation in information technology, everything is embedded with technology, and the financial sector is no exception. The term “FinTech” (Financial Services Technology Consortium) attracted the attention of regulators, consumers and investors in 2014. It was initially applied to the back-end systems of financial and banking institutions. However, Fintech has now become more consumer-oriented, as the combination of financial services and information technology. Specifically, it refers to financial services for consumers through technology. The e-wallet is one of the examples of FinTech in payments and infrastructure that can be freely adopted by everyone. However, the penetration of e-wallet usage in Malaysia is still in its early stages compared to other countries. Methods: The aim of this research is to examine the factors that affect the adoption of e-wallets in Malaysia based on five aspects: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, social influence and government support. These variables were adopted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Questionnaires were given to a targeted group of 100 e-wallet users in Malaysia using the convenient sampling method. The contribution of each factor in explaining the adoption of e-wallets was analyzed using multiple regression. Results: The results show that social influence has a significant relationship with the adoption of e-wallets in Malaysia: the majority of the respondents are at their prime age and their behaviours tend to be influenced by the reference group. The results from this study may encourage more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia to provide e-wallet payment options, transforming their conventional business into a digital business and spurring the growth of the  digital economy in Malaysia. Conclusions: High levels of adoption of e-wallets moves a country towards a cashless society, resulting in better economic growth and environment.

                This theory-building research intends to dig into the renewable energy industry and drawing from research on learning curves and energy polices, proposes a way to speed-up the energy shift from our fossil-fuel dependency to a green economy. Even though standard economic frameworks suggest that markets and not policy makers should decide winners and losers, we urge to accelerate renewable energy competitiveness, proposing that by limiting the number of maturing renewable technologies where resources are allocated to at government level, we reduce the time within which renewables will achieve technological price parity with fossil fuels. In turn, by analyzing the energy demand and supply curves, the study suggests that this action will also mediate the relation between quantity and price, shifting only the supply curve, leaving the demand curve unaffected. It continues by proposing the standardization of a unique renewable energy supply chain model, defined as the SURESC model, relating the indirect effect of limiting the number of maturing technologies to allocate resources, to achieve renewable price-parity with conventional energy sources faster. This is a preliminary theoretical study intended to provide a holistic approach to a known problem.

     alt="DARPP-32 distinguishes a subset of adult-born neurons in zebra finch HVC"/>
<p>We have discovered that the phosphoprotein DARPP-32 is expressed in half of all adult-born neurons (HVC NNs) in the songbird premotor brain region HVC (proper name) during their first month post-mitosis. We demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs cannot be backfilled from target nucleus RA, receive putative catecholaminergic synaptic contacts, and have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs at one month post-mitosis. These data suggest that there are two distinct subtypes of adult-born neurons in songbird HVC.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g., <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here, we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers, suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

                Background: The modern concept of oligometastatic (OM) state has been initially developed to describe patients with a low burden of disease and with a potential for cure with local ablative treatments. We systematically assessed the risk of death and relapse of oligometastatic (OM) cancers compared to cancers with more diffuse metastatic spread, through a meta-analysis of published data.  Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting prognosis of patients with OM solid tumors. Risk of death and relapse were extracted and pooled to provide an adjusted hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval (HR 95%CI).  The primary outcome of the study refers to overall mortality in OM vs. polymetastatic (PM) patients.  Results. Mortality and relapse associated with OM state in patients with cancer were evaluated among 104,234 participants (n=173 studies). Progression-free survival was better in patients with OM disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.68; P <.001; n=69 studies). Also, OM cancers were associated with a better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68; P<.01; n=161 studies). In colorectal (CRC), breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the reduction in the risk of death for OM patients were 35, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. Biliary tract and cervical cancer do not significantly better in OM stage likely for paucity of data. Conclusions. Patients with OM cancers have a significantly better prognosis than those with more widespread stage IV tumors. In OM cancer patients a personalized approach should be pursued.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The presence of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase positive bacteria in hospital setting is an aggravating influential factor for hospitalized patients, and its consequences may be hazardous. Therefore, there is a need for rapid detection methods for newly emerging drug-resistant bacteria. This study was aimed at the molecular characterization of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase -positive  Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from the patients of a teaching hospital in Sindh, Pakistan.   Methods  A total of 513  K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from various clinical samples during June 2019 to May 2020. The collected isolates were investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility (antibiogram), and PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to analyse the ESBL genes.   Results  Among the 513 isolates, as many as 359 (69.9%) were Extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers and 87.5% were multi-drug resistant, while none had resistance to imipenem. PCR scored 3% blaTEM, 3% blaSHV, and 60% blaCTX-M-15 genes for the tested isolates.   Conclusion  The study showed that CTX-M-15 was the major prevalent Extended-spectrum β-lactamase type among the isolates. Additionally, all the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Screening and detection of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase tests are necessary among all isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family in routine microbiology laboratory to prevent associated nosocomial infections. A larger study is essential to understand molecular epidemiology of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing organisms to minimize morbidities due to these multidrug resistant organisms.

                Background: Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many Nigerians in the rural areas and have been found useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effect of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A randomised control trial was conducted in three PHC clusters. The intervention Arm (A) received cash incentives for every presumptive case referred. The Training Arm(B) had no cash incentives and the control had neither training nor cash incentives. Case notification rates from the TB program were used to assess the effect of cash incentives on TB case finding. Data was analyzed using Graph Pad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Mean increases in case notification rates was calculated Statistical significance was set as P=0.05. Results: The intervention identified 394 presumptive TB cases, contributing 30.3% of all presumptive cases notified in the LGAs. Findings also showed an increase of 14.4% (ꭓ2=2.976, P value=0.2258) in case notification rates for the Arm A that received cash incentives alongside training, there was also an increase of 7.4% (ꭓ2= 1.999, P value=0.1575) in Arm B that received Training only. Secondary outcomes indicated a 144.8%(ꭓ2= 4.147, P value=0.1258)  increase in community outreaches conducted in the Arm that were given cash incentives. Conclusion: The study demonstrated an increase in TB control activities of case notification and outreaches among community health workers that received cash incentives and training.  These findings support the use training and cash incentives for CHWs in high burden TB settings to improve TB case detection rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A causal role for the right frontal eye fields in value comparison</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have suggested close functional links between overt visual attention and decision making. This suggests that the corresponding mechanisms may interface in brain regions known to be crucial for guiding visual attention – such as the frontal eye field (FEF). Here, we combined brain stimulation, eye tracking, and computational approaches to explore this possibility. We show that inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right FEF has a causal impact on decision making, reducing the effect of gaze dwell time on choice while also increasing reaction times. We computationally characterize this putative mechanism by using the attentional drift diffusion model (aDDM), which reveals that FEF inhibition reduces the relative discounting of the non-fixated option in the comparison process. Our findings establish an important causal role of the right FEF in choice, elucidate the underlying mechanism, and provide support for one of the key causal hypotheses associated with the aDDM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ripples reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity in human anterior temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Direct brain recordings have provided important insights into how high frequency activity captured through intracranial EEG (iEEG) supports human memory retrieval. The extent to which such activity is comprised of transient fluctuations that reflect the dynamic coordination of underlying neurons, however, remains unclear. Here, we simultaneously record iEEG, local field potential (LFP), and single unit activity in the human temporal cortex. We demonstrate that fast oscillations within the previously identified 80-120 Hz ripple band contribute to 70-200 Hz high frequency activity in the human cortex. These ripple oscillations exhibit a spectrum of amplitudes and durations related to the amount of underlying neuronal spiking. Ripples in the macro-scale iEEG are related to the number and synchrony of ripples in the micro-scale LFP, which in turn are related to the synchrony of neuronal spiking. Our data suggest that neural activity in the human temporal lobe is organized into transient bouts of ripple oscillations that reflect underlying bursts of spiking activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural control of growth and size in the axolotl limb regenerate</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that regulate growth and size of the regenerating limb in tetrapods such as the Mexican axolotl are unknown. Upon the completion of the developmental stages of regeneration, when the regenerative organ known as the blastema completes patterning and differentiation, the limb regenerate is proportionally small in size. It then undergoes a phase of regeneration that we have called the 'tiny-limb' stage, that is defined by rapid growth until the regenerate reaches the proportionally appropriate size. In the current study we have characterized this growth and have found that signaling from the limb nerves is required for its maintenance. Using the regenerative assay known as the Accessory Limb Model, we have found that growth and size of the limb positively correlates with nerve abundance. We have additionally developed a new regenerative assay called the Neural Modified-ALM (NM-ALM), which decouples the source of the nerves from the regenerating host environment. Using the NM-ALM we discovered that non-neural extrinsic factors from differently sized host animals do not play a prominent role in determining the size of the regenerating limb. We have also discovered that the regulation of limb size is not autonomously regulated by the limb nerves. Together, these observations show that the limb nerves provide essential cues to regulate ontogenetic allometric growth and the final size of the regenerating limb.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Elevated FBXO45 promotes liver tumorigenesis through enhancing IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and subsequent PLK1 upregulation</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of tumor-relevant proteins may contribute to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis. FBXO45 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is frequently elevated expression in human HCC. However, it remains unknown whether FBXO45 is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and how to treat HCC patients with high FBXO45 expression. Here, IHC and qPCR analysis revealed that FBXO45 protein and mRNA were highly expressed in 54.3% (57 of 105) and 52.2% (132 of 253) of the HCC tissue samples, respectively. Highly expressed FBXO45 promoted liver tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. Mechanistically, FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 ubiquitination at the Lys190 and Lys450 sites and subsequent activation, leading to the upregulation of PLK1 expression and the induction of cell proliferation and liver tumorigenesis <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i>. PLK1 inhibition or IGF2BP1 knockdown significantly blocked FBXO45-driven liver tumorigenesis in FBXO45 transgenic mice, primary cells and HCCs. Furthermore, IHC analysis on HCC tissue samples revealed a positive association between the hyperexpression of FBXO45 and PLK1/IGF2BP1, and both had positive relationship with poor survival in HCC patients. Thus, FBXO45 plays an important role in promoting liver tumorigenesis through IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and activation, and subsequent PLK1 upregulation, suggesting a new strategy for treating HCC by targeting FBXO45/IGF2BP1/PLK1 axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Relating multivariate shapes to genescapes using phenotype-biological process associations for craniofacial shape</a></h4>

              
                Realistic mappings of genes to morphology are inherently multivariate on both sides of the equation. The importance of coordinated gene effects on morphological phenotypes is clear from the intertwining of gene actions in signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks, and developmental processes underlying the development of shape and size. Yet, current approaches tend to focus on identifying and localizing the effects of individual genes and rarely leverage the information content of high dimensional phenotypes. Here, we explicitly model the joint effects of biologically coherent collections of genes on a multivariate trait-craniofacial shape - in a sample of<i> n </i>= 1,145 mice from the Diversity Outbred (DO) experimental line. We use biological process gene ontology (GO) annotations to select skeletal and facial development gene sets and solve for the axis of shape variation that maximally covaries with gene set marker variation. We use our process-centered, multivariate genotype-phenotype (process MGP) approach to determine the overall contributions to craniofacial variation of genes involved in relevant processes and how variation in different processes corresponds to multivariate axes of shape variation. Further, we compare the directions of effect in phenotype space of mutations to the primary axis of shape variation associated with broader pathways within which they are thought to function. Finally, we leverage the relationship between mutational and pathway-level effects to predict phenotypic effects beyond craniofacial shape in specific mutants. We also introduce an online application which provides users the means to customize their own process-centered craniofacial shape analyses in the DO. The process-centered approach is generally applicable to any continuously varying phenotype and thus has wide-reaching implications for complex-trait genetics.

                Although fear memory formation is essential for survival and fear-related mental disorders, the neural circuitry and mechanism are incompletely understood. Here, we utilized trace fear conditioning to study the formation of trace fear memory in mice. We identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a critical component of sensory signaling to the amygdala. We adopted both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to demonstrate that release of the cholecystokinin (CCK) from the EC is required for trace fear memory formation. We discovered that CCK-positive neurons project from the EC to the lateral nuclei of the amygdala (LA), and inhibition of CCK-dependent signaling in the EC prevented long-term potentiation of the auditory response in the LA and formation of trace fear memory. In summary, high-frequency activation of EC neurons triggers the release of CCK in their projection terminals in the LA, potentiating auditory response in LA neurons. The neural plasticity in the LA leads to trace fear memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Immunomodulatory drug discovery from herbal medicines: Insights from organ-specific activity and xenobiotic defenses</a></h4>

              
                Traditional herbal medicines, which emphasize a holistic, patient-centric view of disease treatment, provide an exciting starting point for discovery of new immunomodulatory drugs. Progress on identification of herbal molecules with proven single agent activity has been slow, in part because of insufficient consideration of pharmacology fundamentals. Many molecules derived from medicinal plants exhibit low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance, leading to low systemic exposure. Recent research suggests that such molecules can act locally in the gut or liver to activate xenobiotic defense pathways that trigger beneficial systemic effects on the immune system. We discuss this hypothesis in the context of four plant-derived molecules with immunomodulatory activity: indigo, polysaccharides, colchicine, and ginsenosides. We end by proposing research strategies for identification of novel immunomodulatory drugs from herbal medicine sources that are informed by the possibility of local action in the gut or liver, leading to generation of systemic immune mediators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Live imaging reveals the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activation</a></h4>

              
                SARM1 is an inducible NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase that triggers axon loss and neuronal cell death in the injured and diseased nervous system. While SARM1 activation and enzyme function are well defined, the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity but prior to axonal demise are much less well understood. Defects in calcium, mitochondria, ATP, and membrane homeostasis occur in injured axons, but the relationships among these events have been difficult to disentangle because prior studies analyzed large collections of axons in which cellular events occur asynchronously. Here we used live imaging of mouse sensory neurons with single axon resolution to investigate the cellular events downstream of SARM1 activity. Our studies support a model in which SARM1 NADase activity leads to an ordered sequence of events from loss of cellular ATP, to defects in mitochondrial movement and depolarization, followed by calcium influx, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and loss of membrane permeability prior to catastrophic axonal self-destruction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mesoscale organization of syntaxin 1A and SNAP25 is determined by SNARE-SNARE-interactions</a></h4>

              
                SNARE proteins have been described as the effectors of fusion events in the secretory pathway more than two decades ago. The strong interactions between SNARE-domains are clearly important in membrane fusion, but it is unclear whether they are involved in any other cellular processes. Here, we analyzed two classical SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1A and SNAP25. Although they are supposed to be engaged in tight complexes, we surprisingly find them largely segregated in the plasma membrane. Syntaxin 1A only occupies a small fraction of the plasma membrane area. Yet, we find it is able to redistribute the far more abundant SNAP25 on the mesoscale by gathering crowds of SNAP25 molecules onto syntaxin-clusters in a SNARE-domain dependent manner. Our data suggests that SNARE-domain interactions are not only involved in driving membrane fusion on the nanoscale, but also play an important role in controlling the general organization of proteins on the mesoscale. Further, we propose this mechanisms preserves active syntaxin 1A-SNAP25 complexes at the plasma membrane.

                Positively-charged amino acids respond to membrane potential changes to drive voltage sensor movement in voltage-gated ion channels, but determining the displacements of voltage sensor gating charges has proven difficult. We optically tracked the movement of the two most extracellular charged residues (R1, R2) in the Shaker potassium channel voltage sensor using a fluorescent positively-charged bimane derivative (qBBr) that is strongly quenched by tryptophan. By individually mutating residues to tryptophan within the putative pathway of gating charges, we observed that the charge motion during activation is a rotation and a tilted translation that differs between R1 and R2. Tryptophan-induced quenching of qBBr also indicates that a crucial residue of the hydrophobic plug is linked to the Cole-Moore shift through its interaction with R1. Finally, we show that this approach extends to additional voltage-sensing membrane proteins using the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> voltage sensitive phosphatase (CiVSP) (Murata et al., 2005a).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics coupled to the neuroblast polarity cycle</a></h4>

              
                The Par complex dynamically polarizes to the apical cortex of asymmetrically dividing <i>Drosophila </i>neuroblasts where it directs fate determinant segregation. Previously we showed that apically directed cortical movements that polarize the Par complex require F-actin (Oon and Prehoda, 2019). Here we report the discovery of cortical actomyosin dynamics that begin in interphase when the Par complex is cytoplasmic but ultimately become tightly coupled to cortical Par dynamics. Interphase cortical actomyosin dynamics are unoriented and pulsatile but rapidly become sustained and apically-directed in early mitosis when the Par protein aPKC accumulates on the cortex. Apical actomyosin flows drive the coalescence of aPKC into an apical cap that is depolarized in anaphase when the flow reverses direction. Together with the previously characterized role of anaphase flows in specifying daughter cell size asymmetry, our results indicate that multiple phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics regulate asymmetric cell division.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of neurotransmitter release by two distinctmembrane-binding faces of the Munc13-1 C­1C2B region</a></h4>

              
                Munc13-1 plays a central role in neurotransmitter release through its conserved C-terminal region, which includes a diacyglycerol (DAG)-binding C<sub>1</sub> domain, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding C<sub>2</sub>B domain, a MUN domain and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain. Munc13-1 was proposed to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane through distinct interactions of the C­<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region with the plasma membrane: i) one involving a polybasic face that is expected to yield a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 and hinder release; and ii) another involving the DAG-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding face that is predicted to result in a slanted orientation and facilitate release. Here we have tested this model and investigated the role of the C­<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that K603E or R769E point mutations in the polybasic face severely impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome bridging and fusion in in vitro reconstitution assays, and synaptic vesicle priming in primary murine hippocampal cultures. A K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops have milder effects in reconstitution assays and do not affect vesicle priming, but enhance or impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release, respectively. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. Our results show that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 plays a central role in vesicle priming and support the notion that two distinct faces of this region control neurotransmitter release and short-term presynaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ZHX2 promotes HIF1α oncogenic signaling in triple-negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and highly lethal disease, which warrants the critical need to identify new therapeutic targets. We show that Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes 2 (<i>ZHX2</i>) is amplified or overexpressed in TNBC cell lines and patients. Functionally, depletion of ZHX2 inhibited TNBC cell growth and invasion in vitro, orthotopic tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, ZHX2 bound with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family members and positively regulated HIF1a activity in TNBC. Integrated ChIP-Seq and gene expression profiling demonstrated that ZHX2 co-occupied with HIF1a on transcriptionally active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, thereby promoting gene expression. Among the identified ZHX2 and HIF1a co-regulated genes, overexpression of <i>AP2B1</i>, <i>COX20</i>, <i>KDM3A</i>, or <i>PTGES3L</i> could partially rescue TNBC cell growth defect by <i>ZHX2</i> depletion, suggested that these downstream targets contribute to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in an accumulative fashion. Furthermore, multiple residues (R491, R581 and R674) on ZHX2 are important in regulating its phenotype, which correspond with their roles on controlling ZHX2 transcriptional activity in TNBC cells. These studies establish that ZHX2 activates oncogenic HIF1a signaling, therefore serving as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glial Nrf2 signaling mediates the neuroprotection exerted by Gastrodia elata Blume in Lrrk2-G2019S Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The most frequent missense mutations in familial Parkinson's disease (PD) occur in the highly conserved <i>LRRK2/PARK8</i> gene with G2019S mutation. We previously established a fly model of PD carrying the <i>LRRK2-G2019S</i> mutation that exhibited the parkinsonism-like phenotypes. An herbal medicine-<i>Gastrodia elata</i> Blume (GE), has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced PD models. However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms of GE beneficiary to G2019S-induced PD remain unclear. Here, we show that these G2019S flies treated with water extracts of GE (WGE) and its bioactive compounds, gastrodin and 4-HBA, displayed locomotion improvement and dopaminergic neuron protection. WGE suppressed the accumulation and hyperactivation of G2019S proteins in dopaminergic neurons, and activated the antioxidation and detoxification factor Nrf2 mostly in the astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia. Glial activation of Nrf2 antagonizes G2019S-induced Mad/Smad signaling. Moreover, we treated <i>LRRK2-G2019S</i> transgenic mice with WGE and found the locomotion declines, the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and the number of hyperactive microglia were restored. WGE also suppressed the hyperactivation of G2019S proteins and regulated the Smad2/3 pathways in the mice brains. We conclude that WGE prevents locomotion defects and the neuronal loss induced by G2019S mutation via glial Nrf2/Mad signaling, unveiling a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Essential functions of MLL1 and MLL2 in retinal development and cone cell maintenance</a></h4>

              
                MLL1 (KMT2A) and MLL2 (KMT2B) are homologous members of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases involved in epigenomic transcriptional regulation. Their sequence variants have been associated with neurological and psychological disorders, but little is known about their roles and mechanism of action in CNS development. Using mouse retina as a model, we previously reported the roles of MLL1 in retinal neurogenesis and horizontal cell maintenance. Here we determine roles of MLL2 and MLL1/MLL2 together in retinal development using conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Deleting Mll2 from Chx10+ retinal progenitors resulted in a similar phenotype as Mll1 CKO, but removal of both alleles produced much more severe deficits than each single CKO: 1-month double CKO mutants displayed null light responses in electroretinogram; thin retinal layers, including shorter photoreceptor outer segments with impaired phototransduction gene expression; and reduced numbers of M-cones, horizontal and amacrine neurons, followed by fast retinal degeneration. Despite moderately reduced progenitor cell proliferation at P0, the neurogenic capacity was largely maintained in double CKO mutants. However, upregulated apoptosis and reactive gliosis were detected during postnatal retinal development. Finally, the removal of both MLLs in fated rods produced a normal phenotype, but the CKO in M-cones impaired M-cone function and survival, indicating both cell non-autonomous and autonomous mechanisms. Altogether, our results suggest that MLL1/MLL2 play redundant roles in maintaining specific retinal neurons after cell fate specification and are essential for establishing functional neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning a new class of multisensory associations: High-density electrophysiological mapping of the temporal course of audio-visual object processing.</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory objects that are frequently encountered in the natural environment lead to strong associations across a distributed sensory cortical network, with the end result experience of a unitary percept. Remarkably little is known, however, about the cortical processes sub-serving multisensory object formation and recognition. To advance our understanding in this important domain, the present study investigated the brain processes involved in learning and identification of novel visual-auditory objects. Specifically, we introduce and test a rudimentary three-stage model of multisensory object-formation and processing. Thirty adults were remotely trained for a week to recognize a novel class of multisensory objects (3D shapes paired to complex sounds), and high-density event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to the corresponding unisensory (shapes or sounds only) and multisensory (shapes and sounds) stimuli, before and after intensive training. We identified three major stages of multisensory processing: 1) an early, multisensory, automatic effect (<100 ms) in occipital areas, related to the detection of simultaneous audiovisual signals and not related to multisensory learning 2) an intermediate object-processing stage (100-200 ms) in occipital and parietal areas, sensitive to the learned multi-sensory associations and 3) a late multisensory processing stage (>250 ms) that appears to be involved in both object recognition and possibly memory consolidation. Results from this study provide support for multiple stages of multisensory object learning and recognition that are subserved by an extended network of cortical areas.

                As a morphological impoverished language, how does word structure impact Chinese lexical processing in the brain? To address this issue, the current study examined the temporal signatures and localizations in the human brain for morphological priming effect (compound/derivation constitute priming vs. non-morphological priming) and word structure modulation (derivation vs. compound) in light of EEG-fNIRS fusion. Whilst morphological priming effect was manifested in behavioral performance and left prefrontal hemodynamic responses, word structure effect was prominent drawing on behavioral, ERP, and fNIRS data. Chinese derivations elicited greater activation in the frontal cortex and engaged more distributed network than lexicalized compounds. The results were interpreted by the differing connection patterns between constitute morphemes within a given word structure from spreading activation perspective. Together, Chinese word structure effect showed a distinct pattern from the dual-route mechanism in alphabetic languages. Meanwhile, the current study for the first time identified dissociable behavioral and neurophysiological responses of Chinese derivations and coordinate compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Repressing PTB is incapable to convert reactive astrocytes to dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Lineage reprograming of resident glia cells to induced dopaminergic neurons (iDAns) holds attractive prospect for cell-replacement therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, whether repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) could truly achieve efficient astrocyte-to-iDAn conversion in substantia nigra and striatum aroused widespread controversy. Although reporter+ iDAns were observed by two groups after delivering adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a reporter with shRNA or Crispr-CasRx to repress astroglial PTB, the possibility of AAV leaking into endogenous DAns could not be excluded without using a reliable lineage tracing method. By adopting stringent lineage tracing strategy, two other studies showed that neither knockdown nor genetic deletion of quiescent astroglial PTB fails to obtain iDAns under physiological condition. However, the role of reactive astrocyte might be underestimated since upon brain injury, reactive astrocyte could acquire certain stem cell hallmarks which may facilitate the lineage conversion process. Therefore, whether reactive astrocytes could be genuinely converted to DAns after PTB repression in a PD model needs further validation. In this study, we used Aldh1l1-CreERT2-mediated specific astrocyte-lineage tracing method to investigate whether reactive astrocytes could be converted to DAns in the 6-OHDA PD model. However, we found that no astrocyte-originated DAns was generated after effective knockdown of astroglial PTB either in the substantia nigra or in the striatum, while AAV leakage to nearby neurons was observed. Our results further confirmed that repressing PTB is unable to convert astrocytes to DA neurons no matter in physiological or PD-related pathological conditions.

                Electron microscopy (EM) allows for the reconstruction of dense neuronal connectomes but suffers from low throughput, limiting its application to small numbers of reference specimens. We developed a protocol and analysis pipeline using tissue expansion and lattice light-sheet microscopy (ExLLSM) to rapidly reconstruct selected circuits across many samples with single synapse resolution and molecular contrast. We validate this approach in Drosophila, demonstrating that it yields synaptic counts similar to those obtained by EM, can be used to compare counts across sex and experience, and to correlate structural connectivity with functional connectivity. This approach fills a critical methodological gap in studying variability in the structure and function of neural circuits across individuals within and between species.

                Introspective agents can recognize the extent to which their internal perceptual experiences deviate from the actual states of the external world. This ability, also known as insight, is critically required for reality testing and is impaired in psychosis, yet very little is known about its cognitive underpinnings. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework and a novel psychophysics paradigm to quantitatively characterize this type of insight while participants experienced a motion-aftereffect illusion. Participants could compensate for the illusion when judging the actual direction of a motion stimulus. Furthermore, confidence, reaction-time, and pupil-dilation data all showed signatures consistent with inferential adjustments in the Bayesian insight model. Our results suggest that people can question what they see and make insightful inferences that incorporate introspective knowledge about internal distortions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of individual sensory nerve axons from digits to spinal cord with the Transparent Embedding Solvent System</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the connections and projections of neurons has been a fundamental issue for neuroscience. Although strategies have been developed to map the projection of individual axons within the mouse brain, high resolution mapping of individual peripheral nerve axons in peripheral organs or spinal cord has never been achieved. Here, we designed the Transparent Embedding Solvent System (TESOS) method and developed a technical pipeline for imaging, reconstructing and analyzing large samples containing various tissue types at sub-micron resolution. The mouse whole body was reconstructed at micron-scale resolution. We were able to image, reconstruct and analyze the complete axonal projection of individual sensory neurons within an intact mouse paw or spinal cord at sub-micron resolution. Furtherly, we imaged and reconstructed the entire projection course of individual sensory neurons from adult mouse digits to the spinal cord. The TESOS method provides an efficient tool for micron-scale connectome mapping of the peripheral nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale algorithmic search identifies stiff and sloppy dimensions in synaptic architectures consistent with murine neocortical wiring</a></h4>

              
                Complex systems can be defined by "sloppy" dimensions, meaning that their behavior is unmodified by large changes to specific parameter combinations, and "stiff" dimensions whose changes result in considerable modifications. In the case of the neocortex, sloppiness in synaptic architectures would be crucial to allow for the maintenance of spiking dynamics in the normal range despite a diversity of inputs and both short- and long-term changes to connectivity. Using simulations on neural networks with spiking matched to murine visual cortex, we determined the stiff and sloppy parameters of synaptic architectures across three classes of input (brief, continuous, and cyclical). Large-scale algorithmically-generated connectivity parameter values revealed that specific combinations of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity are stiff and that all other architectural details are sloppy. Stiff dimensions are consistent across a range of different input classes with self-sustaining synaptic architectures occupying a smaller subspace as compared to the other input classes. We also find that experimentally estimated connectivity probabilities from mouse visual cortex are similarly stiff and sloppy when compared to the architectures that we identified algorithmically. This suggests that simple statistical descriptions of spiking dynamics are a sufficient and parsimonious description of neocortical activity when examining structure-function relationships at the mesoscopic scale. Moreover, this study provides further evidence of the importance of the interrelationship of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity to establish and maintain stable spiking dynamical regimes in neocortex.

                Having measurable physiological correlates, hypnosis should be measurable generally itself. The precise, continual, quantitative assessment (versus phenomenological one) of a current trance level (i.e., "depth") is possible only instrumentally. We've shown that electrophysiological patterns of a trance are stable from session to session, but significantly vary among subjects. Hence, to measure the trance level individually we proposed the following Brain-Computer interface approach and tested it on the 27 video-EEG recordings of 8 outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders: on the data of the first session using Common Spatial Pattern filtering and Linear Discriminant Analysis classification, we trained the predictive models to discriminate conditions of "a wakefulness" and "a deep trance" and applied them to the subsequent sessions to predict the deep trance probability (in fact, to measure the trance level). We obtained integrative individualized continuously changing parameter reflecting the hypnosis level graphically online, providing the trance microdynamics control. The classification accuracy was high, especially while filtering the signal in 1.5-14 and 4-15 Hz. The applications and perspectives are being discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical-subcortical structural connections support transcranial magnetic stimulation engagement of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala processes valenced stimuli, influences affective states, and exhibits aberrant activity across anxiety disorders, depression, and PTSD. Interventions that modulate amygdala activity hold promise for treating transdiagnostic affective symptoms. We investigated (N=45) whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicits indirect changes in amygdala activity when applied to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), a region important for affect regulation. Harnessing in-scanner interleaved TMS/functional MRI (fMRI), we reveal that vlPFC neurostimulation evoked acute, dose-dependent modulations of amygdala fMRI BOLD signal. Larger TMS-evoked changes in amygdala fMRI signal were associated with higher fiber density in a vlPFC-amygdala white matter pathway, suggesting this pathway facilitated stimulation-induced communication between cortex and subcortex. This work provides evidence of amygdala engagement by TMS, highlighting stimulation of vlPFC-amygdala circuits as a candidate treatment for affective psychopathology. More broadly, it indicates that targeting cortical-subcortical connections may enhance the impact of TMS on subcortical neural activity and, by extension, subcortex-subserved behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory processing sensitivity and axonal microarchitecture: Identifying brain structural characteristics for behavior</a></h4>

              
                Previously, researchers used functional MRI to identify regional brain activations associated with sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), a proposed normal phenotype trait. To further validate SPS as a behavioral entity, to characterize it anatomically, and to test the usefulness in psychology of methodologies that assess axonal properties, the present study correlated SPS proxy questionnaire scores (adjusted for neuroticism) with diffusion tensor imaging measures. Participants (n=408) from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project that are free of neurologic and psychiatric disorders were investigated. We computed mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). A voxelwise, exploratory analysis showed that MD and RD correlated positively with SPS proxy scores in the right and left subcallosal and anterior ventral cingulum bundle, and the right forceps minor of the corpus callosum (peak Cohens D effect size = 0.269). Further analyses showed correlations throughout the entire right and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate and arcuate fasciculus. These prefrontal regions are generally involved in emotion, reward and social processing. FA was negatively correlated with SPS proxy scores in white matter of the right premotor/motor/somatosensory/supramarginal gyrus regions, which are associated with empathy, theory of mind, primary and secondary somatosensory processing. Region of interest (ROI) analysis, based-on previous fMRI results and Freesurfer atlas-defined areas, showed small effect sizes, (+0.151 to -0.165) in white matter of the precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus. Other ROI effects were found in regions of the dorsal and ventral visual pathways and primary auditory cortex. The results reveal that in a large, diverse group of participants axonal microarchitectural differences can be identified with SPS traits that are subtle and in the range of typical behavior. The results suggest that the heightened sensory processing in people who show SPS may be influenced by the microstructure of white matter in specific neocortical regions. Although previous fMRI studies had identified most of these general neocortical regions, the DTI results put a new focus on brain areas related to attention and cognitive flexibility, empathy, emotion and low-level sensory processing, as in the primary sensory cortex. Psychological trait characterization may benefit from diffusion tensor imaging methodology by identifying influential brain systems for traits.

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain. The complement-phagosome pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Here we measured levels of complement-phagocytosis molecules, including galectin-3, C3, C4, and cathepsin D, in the plasma of 56 patients with PD, and 46 normal controls (NCs). Plasma levels of galectin-3 (9.93 ± 3.94 ng/mL) were significantly higher in PD patients compared with NCs (8.39 ± 1.95 ng/mL, p = 0.012), and demonstrated a positive correlation with Hoehn and Yahr stages in PD patients (R2 = 0.218, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). On the other hand, plasma C3 levels were significantly lower in PD patients (305.27 ± 205.16 μg/mL) compared with NCs (444.34 ± 245.54 μg/mL, p = 0.002). However, the levels did not correlate with Hoehn and Yahr stages (R2 = 0.010, p = 0.469). Plasma levels of C4 and cathepsin D in PD patients were similar to those in NCs. Our results show possible altered complement-phagocytosis signals in the peripheral blood of PD patients, highlighting the potential of galectin-3 as a biomarker of PD.</p>

	<p>Peripheral inflammation plays a key role in the development of depression-like behaviors. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the level of citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) significantly increased in the plasma of wildtype mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which indicated that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were formed. Moreover, the LPS-induced depression-like and asocial behaviors were significantly alleviated in the mice deficient of NETs. Mechanistically, NETs formation aggravated peripheral inflammation by increasing the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in plasma, which are major proinflammatory cytokines that can enter the brain, resulting in microglia activation and reduced astrocytes. Following this, increased TNF-α and IL-1β were released into brain, inducing neuroinflammation and finally depression-like behaviors. Prohibiting NETs by PAD4 ablation significantly prevented LPS-induced microglia activation and the loss of astrocytes. Our results propose the role for peripheral NETs in LPS-induced depression-like behavior, and that NETs might be a potential target to prevent inflammation-induced major depressive disorder.</p>

	<p>Categorization based on quasi-joint stiffness (QJS) may help clinicians select appropriate ankle foot orthoses (AFOs). The objectives of the present study were to classify the gait pattern based on ankle joint stiffness, also called QJS, of the gait in patients after stroke and to clarify differences in the type of AFO among 72 patients after stroke. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify gait patterns based on QJS at least one month before the study, which revealed three distinct subgroups (SGs 1, 2, and 3). The proportion of use of AFOs, articulated AFOs, and non-articulated AFOs were significantly different among SGs 1–3. In SG1, with a higher QJS in the early and middle stance, the proportion of the patients using articulated AFOs was higher, whereas in SG3, with a lower QJS in both stances, the proportion of patients using non-articulated AFOs was higher. In SG2, with a lower QJS in the early stance and higher QJS in the middle stance, the proportion of patients using AFOs was lower. These findings indicate that classification of gait patterns based on QJS in patients after stroke may be helpful in selecting AFO. However, large sample sizes are required to confirm these results.</p>

	<p>In a recent study, we used the dynamic temporal prediction (DTP) task to demonstrate that the capability to implicitly adapt motor control as a function of task demand is grounded in at least three dissociable neurofunctional mechanisms: expectancy implementation, expectancy violation and response implementation, which are supported by as many distinct cortical networks. In this study, we further investigated if this ability can be predicted by the individual brain’s functional organization at rest. To this purpose, we recorded resting-state, high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) in healthy volunteers before performing the DTP task. This allowed us to obtain source-reconstructed cortical activity and compute whole-brain resting state functional connectivity at the source level. We then extracted phase locking values from the parceled cortex based on the Destrieux atlas to estimate individual functional connectivity at rest in the three task-related networks. Furthermore, we applied a machine-learning approach (i.e., support vector regression) and were able to predict both behavioral (response speed and accuracy adaptation) and neural (ERP modulation) task-dependent outcome. Finally, by exploiting graph theory nodal measures (i.e., degree, strength, local efficiency and clustering coefficient), we characterized the contribution of each node to the task-related neural and behavioral effects. These results show that the brain’s intrinsic functional organization can be potentially used as a predictor of the system capability to adjust motor control in a flexible and implicit way. Additionally, our findings support the theoretical framework in which cognitive control is conceived as an emergent property rooted in bottom-up associative learning processes.</p>

	<p>Dementia is a progressive disease that puts substantial strain on caregivers. Many persons with dementia (PwDs) receive care from a relative. Since male and female caregivers experience different issues related to stress, it is important to meet their different needs to prevent the early nursing home placement of PwDs. This study investigated the multifactorial aspects of caregiver burden and explored gender differences in caregiver burden in a rural setting. This was a cross sectional study that administered anonymous questionnaires to family caregivers of PwDs. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers—short version. A path model was used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. To reflect the multifaceted aspects of caregiver burden, we used Pearlin’s model with its four dimensions. A total of 113 family caregivers responded to our survey. The overall burden of caregivers was moderate. According to the path model, gender differences were predictors of caregiver burden. The behaviour of the person with dementia and cohabitation had direct effects on caregiver burden. Our results suggest that the experiences of men and women caring for a PwD are different and highlight the need for tailored support in dementia care.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional ultrasound imaging of recent and remote memory recall in the associative fear neural network in mice</a></h4>

              
                Emotional learning and memory are affected in numerous psychiatric disorders. At a systems level, however, the underlying neural circuitry is not well defined. Rodent fear conditioning (FC) provides a translational model to study the networks underlying associative memory retrieval. In the current study, functional connectivity among regions related to the cue associative fear network were investigated using functional ultrasound (fUS), a novel imaging technique with great potential for detecting regional neural activity through cerebral blood flow. Behavioral fear expression and fUS imaging were performed one and thirty-one days after FC to assess recent and remote memory recall. Cue-evoked increases in functional connectivity were detected throughout the amygdala, with the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei emerging as major hubs of connectivity, though CeA connectivity was reduced during remote recall. The hippocampus and sensory cortical regions displayed heightened connectivity with the LA during remote recall, whereas interconnectivity between the primary auditory cortex and temporal association areas was reduced. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited variable connectivity changes, where prelimbic connectivity with the amygdala was refined while specific connections between the infralimbic cortex and amygdalar subregions emerged during remote memory retrieval. Moreover, freezing behavior positively correlated with functional connectivity between hubs of the associative fear network, suggesting that emotional response intensity reflected the strength of the cue-evoked functional network. Overall, our data provide evidence of the functionality of fUS imaging to investigate the neural dynamics of memory encoding and retrieval, applicable in the development of innovative treatments for affective disorders.

                Extracellular signaling proteins serve as neuronal growth cone guidance molecules during development and are well positioned to be involved in neuronal regeneration and recovery from injury. Semaphorins and their receptors, the plexins, are a family of conserved proteins involved in development that, in the nervous system, are axonal guidance cues mediating axon pathfinding and synapse formation. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes for three semaphorins and two plexin receptors: the transmembrane semaphorins, SMP-1 and SMP-2, signal through their receptor, PLX-1, while the secreted semaphorin, MAB-20, signals through PLX-2. Here, we determined the neuronal morphology and locomotion behavior of knockout animals missing each of the semaphorins and plexins; we described the expression pattern of all plexins in the nervous system of C. elegans; and we evaluated their effect on the regeneration of motoneuron neurites and the recovery of locomotion behavior following precise laser microsurgery.

                We introduce a family of bright, rhodamine-based calcium indicators with tuneable affinities and colors. The indicators can be specifically localized to different cellular compartments and are compatible with both fluorescence and bioluminescence readouts through conjugation to HaloTag fusion proteins. Importantly, their increase in fluorescence upon localization enables no-wash live-cell imaging, which greatly facilitates their use in biological assays. Applications as fluorescent indicators in rat hippocampal neurons include the detection of single action potentials and of calcium fluxes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Applications as bioluminescent indicators include the recording of the pharmacological modulation of nuclear calcium in high-throughput-compatible assays. The versatility and remarkable ease of use of these indicators make them powerful tools for bioimaging and bioassays.

                Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) provides noninvasive evaluation of brain metabolism. However, there are some limitations of 1H-MRSI preventing its wider use in the clinics, including the spectral quality issues, partial volume effect and chemical shift artifact. Additionally, it is necessary to create metabolite maps for analyzing spectral data along with other MRI modalities. In this study, a MATLAB-based open-source data analysis software for 3D 1H-MRSI, called Oryx-MRSI, which includes modules for visualization of raw 1H-MRSI data and LCModel outputs, chemical shift correction, tissue fraction calculation, metabolite map production, and registration onto standard MNI152 brain atlas while providing automatic spectral quality control, is presented. Oryx-MRSI implements region of interest analysis at brain parcellations defined on MNI152 brain atlas. All generated metabolite maps are stored in NIfTI format. Oryx-MRSI is publicly available at https://github.com/sevimcengiz/Oryx-MRSI along with six example datasets.

                Certain atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) used in the treatment of schizophrenia have been hypothesized to show reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), due to their ability to promote nigrostriatal dopamine release through 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) blockade. The strength of this hypothesis is currently limited to a consideration of the relative receptor affinities of APDs for the 5-HT2AR and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). Here we measure the 5-HT2AR kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and correlate these properties with their observed EPS at therapeutic doses. For compounds with negligible affinity for 5-HT2AR, EPS is robustly predicted by a D2R specific rebinding model that integrates D2R association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade (kr). However, we show that for compounds with significant affinity for the 5-HT2AR, such as sertindole, higher relative 5-HT2A occupancy over time is an indicator for a reduced propensity to cause EPS. This study suggests that there is room for the development of novel kinetically optimised antipsychotic agents that modulate both serotonergic and dopamine function in a manner beneficial in the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease.

                Electrophysiology and optical imaging provide complementary neural sensing capabilities; electrophysiological recordings have the highest temporal resolution, while optical imaging allows recording the activities of genetically defined populations at high spatial resolution. Combining these complementary, yet orthogonal modalities to perform simultaneous large-scale, multimodal sensing of neural activity across multiple brain regions would be very powerful. Here we show that transparent, inkjet-printed electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays can be seamlessly integrated with morphologically conformant transparent polymer skulls for multimodal recordings across the cortex. These eSee-Shells, were implanted on transgenic mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f in cortical excitatory cells and provided a robust opto-electrophysiological interface for over 100 days. eSee-Shells enable simultaneous mesoscale Ca2+ imaging and ECoG acquisition under anesthesia as well as in awake animals presented with sensory stimuli. eSee-Shells further show sufficient clarity and transparency to observe single-cell Ca2+ signals directly below the electrodes and interconnects. Simultaneous multimodal measurement of cortical dynamics reveals changes in both ECoG and Ca2+ signals that depend on the behavioral state.

	<p>Introduction: the perception of Quality of Life (QoL) has been used to evaluate the treatment and evolution of several pathologies. QoL evaluation allows a better understanding of the patient and his adaptation to the disease. An observational, community-based and descriptive correlational study was carried out to analyze stroke survivors’ perception of QoL. Methods: consecutive case-series of stroke survivors (≥3 months) followed in a single public primary health center (“Tavira Primary Health Centre”) from Algarve, southern Portugal. The Portuguese version of the World Health Organization Quality of life instrument was administered in 102 stroke survivors. Results: Perception of QoL was associated (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) with specific sociodemographic (age, sex, marital status, academic training), economic (monthly family income) and clinical factors (number of vascular risk factors, type of stroke, evolution, chronic mRankin score). On multivariate analysis, chronic mRankin score on physical (R2 = 0.406; F = 8.757; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), psychological (R2 = 0.286; F = 5.536; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and general domain (R2 = 0.357; F = 7.287; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); and family income (R2 = 0.160; F = 3.156; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005) on environmental domain, emerged as predictors of QoL. Conclusion: Different socio-demographic, economic and health factors are associated with post-stroke QoL. Description of QoL contributes to the overall evaluation of the impact of stroke on health and should be a priority for health professionals.</p>

	<p>In this discussion paper, I review a number of common misconceptions about the phonological deficit theory (PDH) of dyslexia. These include the common but mistaken idea that the PDH is simply about phonemic awareness (PA), and, consequently, is a circular “pseudo”-explanation or epiphenomenon of reading difficulties. I argue that PA is only the “tip of the phonological iceberg” and that “deeper” spoken-language phonological impairments among dyslexics appear well before the onset of reading and even at birth. Furthermore, not even reading-specific expressions of phonological deficits—PA or pseudoword naming, can be considered circular if we clearly distinguish between reading proper—real meaning-bearing words, or real text, and the mechanisms (subskills) of reading development (such as phonological recoding). I also explain why an understanding of what constitutes an efficient writing system explains why phonology is necessarily a major source of variability in reading ability and hence a core deficit (or at least one core deficit) among struggling readers whether dyslexic or non-dyslexic. I also address the misguided notion that the PDH has now fallen out of favor because most dyslexia researchers have (largely) ceased studying phonological processing. I emphasize that acceptance of the PDH does not imply repudiation of other non-phonological hypotheses because the PDH does not claim to account for all the variance in reading ability/disability. Finally, I ask where neurobiology enters the picture and suggest that researchers need to exercise more caution in drawing their conclusions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>) which are age sub-specialized on distinct defense tasks and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than non-soldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Both high behavioral specialization in stable environmental conditions and reassignment across task groups during a crisis occur in <i>T. angustula</i>. The differences in neurobiology we report here are consistent with these specialized but flexible defense strategies. This work broadens our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Ultrastructural analysis of the morphological phenotypes of microglia associated with neuro‐inflammatory cues</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that are responsible for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. There is a plethora of evidence to suggest that microglia display distinct phenotypes that are associated with the alteration of cell morphology under varying environmental cues. However, it has not been fully explored how the varying states of microglial activation are linked to the alteration of microglia morphology, especially in the microdomain. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize the ultrastructural morphology of human microglia under neuro-inflammatory cues. To address this, a human cell line of microglia was stimulated by anti-inflammatory (IL-4), pro-inflammatory (TNF-α), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cues (Aβ, Aβ + TNF-α). The resulting effects on microglia morphology associated with changes in microdomain were analyzed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrated that microglial activation under pro-inflammatory and AD-cues were closely linked to changes not only in cell shape, but also in cell surface topography and higher-order branching of processes. Furthermore, our results revealed that microglia under pro-inflammatory cues exhibited unique morphological features involving cell-to-cell contact and the formation of vesicle-like structures. Our study provides insight into the fine details of microglia morphology associated with varying status of microglial activation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-linked suppression of lipoxin A4 mediates cognitive deficits in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Age increases the risk for cognitive impairment and is the single major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly. The pathophysiological processes triggered by aging that render the brain vulnerable to dementia involve, at least in part, changes in inflammatory mediators. Here we show that lipoxin A4 (LXA4), a lipid mediator of inflammation resolution known to stimulate endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, is reduced in the aging central nervous system. We demonstrate that genetic suppression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the enzyme mediating LXA4 synthesis, promotes learning impairment in mice. Conversely, administration of exogenous LXA4 attenuated cytokine production and memory loss induced by inflammation in mice. We further show that cerebrospinal fluid LXA4 is reduced in patients with dementia and positively associates with memory performance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and AD-linked amyloid-{beta}. Our findings suggest that reduced LXA4 levels may lead to vulnerability to age-related cognitive disorders and that promoting LXA4 signaling may comprise an effective strategy to prevent early cognitive decline in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">New neurons in old brains: A cautionary tale for the analysis of neurogenesis in post-mortem tissue.</a></h4>

              
                Adult neurogenesis has primarily been examined in two key regions in the mammalian brain, the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The proliferation and integration of newly generated neurons has been observed widely in adult mammalian species including the human hippocampus. Recent high-profile studies have suggested however, that this process is considerably reduced in humans, occurring in children but declining rapidly and nearly completely in the adult brain. In comparison, rodent studies also show age-related decline but a greater degree of proliferation of new neurons in adult animals. Here, we examine whether differences in tissue fixation, rather than biological difference in human versus rodent studies might account for the diminished levels of neurogenesis sometimes observed in the human brain. To do so we analyzed neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were either perfusion-fixed or the brains extracted and immersion-fixed at various post-mortem intervals. We observed an interaction between animal age and the time delay between death and tissue fixation. While similar levels of neurogenesis were observed in young rats regardless of fixation, older rats had significantly fewer labeled neurons when fixation was not immediate. Furthermore, the morphological detail of the labeled neurons was significantly reduced in the delayed fixation conditions at all ages. This study highlights critical concerns that must be considered when using post-mortem tissue to quantify adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliable population utility signal from diverse economic value coding in orbitofrontal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Economic value encapsulates the subjective combination of reward magnitude and probability. We investigated the mechanism for subjective value computation in single neurons using an economic axiomatic approach. We found that single neurons in the macaque orbitofrontal cortex, known to be sensitive to reward magnitude and probability, encode the economic value functions (utility and probability weighting) in a heterogeneous manner, such that the activity of individual neurons did not match the animal's choices. However, the utility and probability weighting code from a population of these varied neurons reliably matched the animals' choices and risk attitudes. Thus, the neuronal population code for economic value amounted to a distributional representation of the formal economic functions. With a diverse single-unit economic value code converging into a reliable population-level utility code, this scheme suggests a brain mechanism for the flexible accommodation of multiple choice patterns and risk attitudes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal diet disrupts the placenta-brain axis in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                High maternal weight is associated with a number of detrimental outcomes in offspring, including increased susceptibility to neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and communicative disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorders). Despite widespread acknowledgement of sex-biases in the prevalence, incidence, and age of onset of these disorders, few studies have investigated potential sex-biased mechanisms underlying disorder susceptibility. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate how maternal high-fat diet causes perinatal inflammation that influences sex-specific behavioral outcomes in offspring. In male high-fat diet offspring, increased macrophage toll like receptor 4 signaling results in excess phagocytosis of serotonin neurons in the developing dorsal raphe nucleus, decreasing serotonin bioavailability in the fetal and adult brain. Bulk sequencing from a large cohort of matched first trimester human fetal brain, placenta, and maternal decidua samples reveals sex-specific transcriptome-wide changes in placenta and brain tissue. Further, we find that fetal brain serotonin is significantly negatively correlated with maternal triglyceride accumulation (a proxy for dietary fat content) in male pregnancies only. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism through which maternal diet may increase offspring susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorder development.

                Despite a relatively fixed anatomical structure, the human brain can support rich cognitive functions, triggering particular interest in investigating structure-function relationships. Myelin is a vital brain microstructure marker, yet the individual microstructure-function relationship is poorly understood. Here, we explore the brain microstructure-function relationships using a higher-order framework. Global (network-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships negatively correlate with male participants personality scores and decline with aging. Nodal (node-level) higher-order microstructure-function relationships are not aligned uniformly throughout the brain, being stronger in association cortices and lower in sensory cortices, showing gender differences. Notably, higher-order microstructure-function relationships are maintained from the whole-brain to local circuits, which uncovers a compelling and straightforward principle of brain structure-function interactions. Additionally, targeted artificial attacks can disrupt these higher-order relationships, and the main results are robust against several factors. Together, our results increase the collective knowledge of higher-order structure-function interactions that may underlie cognition, individual differences, and aging.

                Animal locomotion is hypothesized to be controlled by a central pattern generator in the spinal cord. Experiments and models show that rhythm generating neurons and genetically determined network properties could sustain oscillatory output activity suitable for locomotion. However, current CPG models do not explain how a spinal cord circuitry, which has the same basic genetic plan across species, can adapt to control the different biomechanical properties and locomotion patterns existing in these species. Here we demonstrate that rhythmic and alternating movements in pendulum models can be learned by a monolayer spinal cord circuitry model using the BCM learning rule, which has been previously proposed to explain learning in the visual cortex. These results provide an alternative theory to CPG models, because rhythm generating neurons and genetically defined connectivity are not required in our model.

Author summaryThe central pattern generator is the leading hypothesis of locomotor control in animals. There, rhythm generating neurons and genetically defined neural connectivity would form a circuit generating activity patterns suitable for locomotion. We provide a new hypothesis of locomotor control, where rhythmic patterns are learned by a Hebbian learning rule from a mechanical system that has an intrinsic tendency to oscillate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The overlapping modular organization of human brain functional networks across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Previous lifespan studies have demonstrated that the brain functional modular organization would change along with the adult lifespan. Yet, they assumed mutual exclusion among functional modules, ignoring convergent evidence for the existence of modular overlap. To reveal how age affects the overlapping functional modular organization, this study applied a detection algorithm requiring no prior knowledge of the resting-state fMRI data of a healthy cohort (N = 570, 18-88 years). Age-related regression analyses found a linear decrease in the overlapping modularity and the similarity of modular structure and overlapping node (i.e., region involved in multiple modules) distribution. The number of overlapping nodes increased with age, but the increment was distributed unevenly. In addition, across the adult lifespan and within each age group, the nodal overlapping probability consistently exhibited positive correlations with both functional gradient and flexibility. Further, we showed that the influence of age on memory-related cognitive performance might be explained by the change in the overlapping functional modular organization. Together, our results revealed age-related decreased segregation from the perspective of brain functional overlapping modular organization, providing new insight into the adult lifespan change in brain function and its influence on cognitive performance.

                Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) relieves many motor symptoms of Parkinsons Disease (PD), but its underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Since its advent, three major theories have been proposed: (1) DBS inhibits the STN and basal ganglia output; (2) DBS antidromically activates motor cortex; and (3) DBS disrupts firing dynamics within the STN. Previously, stimulation-related electrical artifacts limited mechanistic investigations using electrophysiology. We used electrical artifact-free calcium imaging to investigate activity in basal ganglia nuclei during STN DBS in parkinsonian mice. To test whether the observed changes in activity were sufficient to relieve motor symptoms, we then combined electrophysiological recording with targeted optical DBS protocols. Our findings suggest that STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effect through the disruption of STN dynamics, rather than inhibition or antidromic activation. These results provide insight into optimizing PD treatments and establish an approach for investigating DBS in other neuropsychiatric conditions.

Early anatomical studies suggested that the VL is organized in a "fan-out fan-in" connectivity matrix comprising only three morphologically identified neuron types; input axons from the superior frontal lobe (SFL) innervating en passant millions of small amacrine interneurons (AMs) which converge sharply onto large VL output neurons (LNs). Recent physiological studies confirmed the feedforward excitatory connectivity: a glutamatergic synapse at the first SFL-to-AM synaptic layer and a cholinergic AM-to-LNs synapse. SFL-to-AMs synapses show a robust hippocampal-like activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmitter release. 5-HT, octopamine, dopamine and nitric oxide modulate short- and long-term VL synaptic plasticity. Here we present a comprehensive histolabeling study to better characterize the neural elements in the VL. We generally confirmed glutamatergic SFLs and cholinergic AMs. Intense labeling for NOS activity in the AMs neurites fitted with the NO-dependent presynaptic LTP mechanism at the SFL-to-AM synapse. New discoveries here reveal more heterogeneity of the VL neurons than previously thought. GABAergic AMs suggest a subpopulation of inhibitory interneurons in the first input layer. Clear GABA labeling in the cell bodies of LNs supported an inhibitory VL output yet the LNs co-expressed FMRFamide-like neuropeptides suggesting an additional neuromodulatory role of the VL output. Furthermore, a group of LNs was glutamatergic. A new cluster of cells organized in a "deep nucleus" showed rich catecholaminergic labeling and may play a role in intrinsic neuromodulation. In situ hybridization and immunolabeling allowed characterization and localization of a rich array of neuropeptides and neuromodulatores, likely involved in reward/punishment signals. This analysis of the fast transmission system, together with the newly found cellular elements helps integrate behavioral, physiological, pharmacological and connectome findings into a more comprehensive understanding of an efficient learning and memory network.

                Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) is a set of birth defects caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy. Microcephaly is its main feature, but other brain abnormalities are found in CZS patients, such as ventriculomegaly, brain calcifications, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Many studies have focused on microcephaly, but it remains unknown how ZIKV infection leads to callosal malformation. To tackle this issue, we infected mouse embryos in utero with a Brazilian ZIKV isolate and found that they are born with a reduction in callosal area and density of callosal neurons. ZIKV infection also causes a density reduction of PH3+ cells, intermediate progenitor cells and SATB2+ neurons. Moreover, axonal tracing revealed that callosal axons are reduced and misrouted. Also, ZIKV infected cultures show a reduction of callosal axon length. GFAP labelling showed that in utero infection compromises glial cells responsible for midline axon guidance. The RNA-Seq data from infected brains identified downregulation of axon guidance and axonogenesis related genes. In sum, we showed that ZIKV infection impairs critical steps of corpus callosum formation by disrupting not only neurogenesis but also axon guidance and growth across the midline.

Summary StatementZika virus infection during development impairs the formation of corpus callosum by disturbing axon guidance and growth of callosal neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state functional connectivity of social brain regions predicts motivated dishonesty</a></h4>

              
                Motivated dishonesty is a typical social behavior varying from person to person. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is capable of identifying unique patterns from functional connectivity (FC) between brain networks. To identify the relevant neural patterns and build an interpretable model to predict dishonesty, we scanned 8-min rsfMRI before an information-passing task. In the task, we employed monetary rewards to induce dishonesty. We applied both connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis to examine the association between FC and dishonesty. CPM indicated that the stronger FC between fronto-parietal and default mode networks can predict a higher dishonesty rate. The ROIs were set in the regions involving four cognitive processes (self-reference, cognitive control, reward valuation, and moral regulation). The ROI analyses showed that a stronger FC between these regions and the prefrontal cortex can predict a higher dishonesty rate. Our study offers an integrated model to predict dishonesty with rsfMRI, and the results suggest that the frequent motivated dishonest behavior may require a higher engagement of social brain regions.

                1Technical advances in artificial manipulation of neural activity have precipitated a surge in studying the causal contribution of brain circuits to cognition and behavior. However, complexities of neural circuits challenge interpretation of experimental results, necessitating theoretical frameworks for system-atic explorations. Here, we take a step in this direction, using, as a testbed, recurrent neural networks trained to perform a perceptual decision. We show that understanding the computations implemented by network dynamics enables predicting the magnitude of perturbation effects based on changes in the networks phase plane. Inactivation effects are weaker for distributed network architectures, are more easily discovered with non-discrete behavioral readouts (e.g., reaction times), and vary considerably across multiple tasks implemented by the same circuit. Finally, networks that can "learn" during inactivation recover function quickly, often much faster than the original training time. Our framework explains past empirical observations by clarifying how complex circuits compensate and adapt to perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Self-Organization of Spatio-Temporal Pattern Selectivity</a></h4>

              
                Spiking model neurons can be set up to respond selectively to specific spatio-temporal spike patterns by optimization of their input weights. It is unknown, however, if existing synaptic plasticity mechanisms can achieve this temporal mode of neuronal coding and computation. Here it is shown that changes of synaptic efficacies which tend to balance excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can make neurons sensitive to particular input spike patterns. Simulations demonstrate that a combination of Hebbian mechanisms, hetero-synaptic plasticity and synaptic scaling is sufficient for self-organizing sensitivity for spatio-temporal spike patterns that repeat in the input. In networks inclusion of hetero-synaptic plasticity leads to specialization and faithful representation of pattern sequences by a group of target neurons. Pattern detection is found to be robust against a range of distortions and noise. Furthermore, the resulting balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs protects the memory for a specific pattern from being overwritten during ongoing learning when the pattern is not present. These results not only provide an explanation for experimental observations of balanced excitation and inhibition in cortex but also promote the plausibility of precise temporal coding in the brain.

Author summaryNeurons communicate using action potentials, that are pulses localized in time. There is evidence that the exact timing of these so called spikes carries information. The hypothesis, however, that computations in brains are indeed based on precise patterns of spikes is debated particularly because this would require the existence of suitable detectors. While theoretically individual neurons can perform spike pattern detection when their input synapses are carefully adjusted it is not known if existing synaptic plasticity mechanisms support this coding principle. Here, a combination of basic but realistic mechanis ms is demonstrated to self-organize the synaptic input efficacies such that individual neurons become detectors of patterns repeating in the input. The proposed combination of learning mechanisms yields a balance of excitation and inhibition similar to observations in cortex, robustness of detection against perturbations and noise, and persistence of memory against ongoing plasticity without the learned patterns. It enables groups of neurons to incrementally learn sets of patterns thereby faithfully representing their  which and  when in sequences. These results suggest that computations based on spatio-temporal spike patterns might emerge without any supervision from the synaptic plasticity mechanisms present in the brain.

                The preservation of cognitive function into old age is a public health priority. Cerebral hypoperfusion is a hallmark of dementia but its impact on maintaining cognitive ability across the lifespan is less clear. We investigated the relationship between baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response during a fluid reasoning task in a population-based adult lifespan cohort (N=227, age 18-88 years). As age differences in baseline CBF could lead to non-neuronal contributions to the BOLD signal, we introduced commonality analysis to neuroimaging, in order to dissociate performance-related CBF effects from the physiological confounding effects of CBF on the BOLD response. Accounting for CBF, we confirmed that performance- and age-related differences in BOLD responses in the multiple-demand network (MDN) implicated in fluid reasoning. Differences in baseline CBF across the lifespan explained not only performance-related BOLD responses, but also performance-independent BOLD responses. Our results suggest that baseline CBF is important for maintaining cognitive function, while its non-neuronal contributions to BOLD signals reflect an age-related confound. Maintaining perfusion into old age may serve to support brain function with behavioural advantage, regulating brain health.

                The comprehensive integration of structural and functional connectivity data is required for the accurate modeling of brain functions. While resources for studying structural connectivity of non-human primate marmoset brains already exist, their integration with functional connectivity data has remained unavailable. Therefore, we present a comprehensive resource for marmoset brain mapping, which integrates the largest awake resting-state fMRI dataset to date (39 marmosets, 709 runs, and 12053 mins), cellular-level neuronal-tracing dataset (52 marmosets and 143 injections), and multi-resolution diffusion MRI dataset. The combination of these data into the same MRI space allowed us to 1). map the fine-detailed functional networks and cortical parcellations; 2). develop a deep-learning-based parcellation generator to preserve the topographical organization of functional connectivity and reflect individual variabilities; 3). investigate the structural basis underlying functional connectivity by computational modeling. Our resource will broadly model the marmoset brain architecture and facilitate future comparative and translational studies of primate brains.

                Fluorescence microscopy imaging speed is fundamentally limited by the measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To improve image SNR for a given image acquisition rate, computational denoising techniques can be used to suppress noise. However, analytical techniques to estimate a denoised image from a single frame are either computationally expensive or rely on simple noise statistical models. These models assume Poisson or Gaussian noise statistics, which are not appropriate for many fluorescence microscopy applications that contain quantum shot noise and electronic Johnson-Nyquist noise, and therefore a mixture of Poisson and Gaussian noise. In this paper, we show convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on mixed Poisson and Gaussian noise images to overcome the limitations of existing image denoising methods. The trained CNN is presented as an open-source ImageJ plugin that performs instant image denoising (within tens of milliseconds) with superior performance (~8.1 dB SNR improvement) compared to the conventional fluorescence microscopy denoising methods. The method is validated on external datasets with out-of-distribution noise and contrast from the training data and consistently achieves high performance (>8dB) denoising in less time than other fluorescence microscopy denoising methods.

                Microglial phagocytosis is rapidly emerging as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. An efficient removal of cellular debris is necessary to prevent buildup damage of neighbor neurons and the development of an inflammatory response. As the brain professional phagocytes, microglia are equipped with an array of mechanisms that enable them to recognize and degrade several types of cargo, including neurons undergoing apoptotic cell death. While microglia are very competent phagocytes of apoptotic cells under physiological conditions, here we report their dysfunction in mouse and monkey (Macaca fascicularis and Callithrix jacchus) models of stroke by transient occlusion of the medial cerebral artery (tMCAo). The impairment of both engulfment and degradation was related to energy depletion triggered by oxygen and nutrients deprivation (OND), which led to reduced process motility, lysosomal depletion, and the induction of a protective autophagy response in microglia. Basal autophagy, which is in charge of removing and recycling intracellular elements, was critical to maintain microglial physiology, including survival and phagocytosis, as we determined both in vivo and in vitro using knock-out models of autophagy genes and the autophagy inhibitor MRT68921. Notably, the autophagy inducer rapamycin partially prevented the phagocytosis impairment induced by tMCAo in vivo but not by OND in vitro. These results suggest a more complex role of microglia in stroke than previously acknowledged, classically related to the inflammatory response. In contrast, here we demonstrate the impairment of apoptotic cell phagocytosis, a microglial function critical for brain recovery. We propose that phagocytosis is a therapeutic target yet to be explored and provide evidence that it can be modulated in vivo using rapamycin, setting the stage for future therapies for stroke patients.

                Invasive tract-tracing studies in rodents implicate a direct connection between the subiculum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) as a key component of neural pathways mediating hippocampal regulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. A clear characterisation of the connections linking the subiculum and BNST in humans and non-human primates is lacking. To address this, we first delineated the projections from the subiculum to the BNST using anterograde tracers injected into macaque monkeys, revealing evidence for a monosynaptic subiculum-BNST projection involving the fornix. Second, we used in vivo diffusion MRI tractography in macaques and humans to demonstrate substantial subiculum complex connectivity to the BNST in both species. This connection was primarily mediated through the fornix, with additional connectivity via the amygdala, consistent with rodent anatomy. Third, utilising the twin-based nature of our human sample, we found that microstructural properties of these tracts are moderately heritable (h2 ~ 0.5). In a final analysis, we found no evidence of any significant association between subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure and indices of perceived stress/dispositional negativity and alcohol use, derived from principal component analysis decomposition of self-report data. We did, however, find subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure associations with BMI, age, and sex. Our findings address a key translational gap in our knowledge of the neurocircuitry regulating stress.

                We demonstrate a simple, low-cost two-photon microscope design with both galvo-galvo and resonant-galvo scanning capabilities. We quantify and compare the signal-to-noise ratios and imaging speeds of the galvo-galvo and resonant-galvo scanning modes when used for murine neurovascular imaging. The two scanning modes perform as expected under shot-noise limited detection and are found to achieve comparable signal-to-noise ratios. Resonant-galvo scanning is capable of reaching desired signal-to-noise ratios using less acquisition time when higher excitation power can be used. Given equal excitation power and total pixel dwell time between the two methods, galvo-galvo scanning outperforms resonant-galvo scanning in image quality when detection deviates from being shot-noise limited.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine depletion can be predicted by the aperiodic component of subthalamic local field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological biomarkers reflecting the pathological activities in the basal ganglia are essential to gain an etiological understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) and develop a method of diagnosing and treating the disease. Previous studies that explored electrophysiological biomarkers in PD have focused mainly on oscillatory or periodic activities such as beta and gamma oscillations. Emerging evidence has suggested that the nonoscillatory, aperiodic component reflects the firing rate and synaptic current changes corresponding to cognitive and pathological states. Nevertheless, it has never been thoroughly examined whether the aperiodic component can be used as a biomarker that reflect pathological activities in the basal ganglia in PD. In this study, we examined the parameters of the aperiodic component and tested its practicality as an electrophysiological biomarker of pathological activity in PD. We found that a set of aperiodic parameters, aperiodic offset and exponent, were significantly decreased by the nigrostriatal lesion. To further prove the usefulness of the parameters as biomarkers, acute levodopa treatment reverted the aperiodic offset. We then compared the aperiodic parameters with a previously established periodic biomarker of PD, beta frequency oscillation. We found a moderately significant negative correlation with beta power. Finally, taking the aperiodic parameters into account, we could significantly improve the beta power-based prediction of pathological activities in the basal ganglia, demonstrating the validity of these parameters as biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural brain connectivity predicts acute pain after mild traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury, mTBI, is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with acute pain manifesting as one of its most debilitating symptoms. Understanding acute post-injury pain is important since it is a strong predictor of long-term outcomes. In this study, we imaged the brains of 172 patients with mTBI, following a motorized vehicle collision and used a machine learning approach to extract white matter structural and resting state fMRI functional connectivity measures to predict acute pain. Stronger white matter tracts within the sensorimotor, thalamic-cortical, and default-mode systems predicted 20% of the variance in pain severity within 72 hours of the injury. This result generalized in two independent groups: 39 mTBI patients and 13 mTBI patients without whiplash symptoms. White matter measures collected at 6-months after the collision still predicted mTBI pain at that timepoint (n = 36). These white-matter connections were associated with two nociceptive psychophysical outcomes tested at a remote body site - namely conditioned pain modulation and magnitude of suprathreshold pain-, and with pain sensitivity questionnaire scores. Our validated findings demonstrate a stable white-matter network, the properties of which determine a significant amount of pain experienced after acute injury, pinpointing a circuitry engaged in the transformation and amplification of nociceptive inputs to pain perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse roles of MeCP2 in the specification and maintenance of midbrain dopamine phenotype.</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are associated with locomotor and psychiatric disorders. DA neuronal phenotype is specified in ancestral progenitors and maintained throughout differentiation. Here we demonstrate that premature MeCP2 expression prevents DA progenitors from acquiring DA phenotype through interfering NURR1 transactivation. By contrast, the maintenance of DA phenotype is not affected by MeCP2 overexpression in DA neurons. By analyzing the DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding to the promoter of DA phenotype gene tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) along differentiation, we show that Th expression is determined by TET1-mediated de-methylation of NURR1 binding sites within Th promoter. Premature MeCP2 dominates the DNA binding of these sites thereby blocking TET1 function in DA progenitors, whereas TET1 prevents excessive MeCP2 binding in DA neurons. Finally, we show that targeted de-methylation in DA progenitors protects phenotype specification from premature MeCP2 expression, whereas targeted methylation disturbs phenotype maintenance in MeCP2-overexpressed DA neurons. These findings demonstrate MeCP2 as a novel determining factor for DA neuronal phenotype and function.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor decline and the aggregation of -synuclein protein. Growing evidence suggests that -synuclein aggregates may spread from neurons of the digestive tract to the brain in a prion-like manner. While rodent models have recapitulated gut-to-brain -synuclein transmission, animal models that are amenable to high-throughput investigations are needed to facilitate the discovery of disease mechanisms. Here we describe the first C. elegans models in which feeding with -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) induced prion-like dopamine neuron degeneration and seeding of aggregation of human -synuclein expressed in the host. PFF acceleration of -synuclein aggregation in C. elegans muscle cells was associated with a progressive motor deficit, whereas feeding with -synuclein monomer produced much milder effects. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the C. elegans syndecan sdn-1, and enzymes involved in heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthesis, afforded protection from PFF-induced seeding of aggregation and toxicity, as well as dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work offers new models by which to investigate gut-derived -synuclein spreading and propagation of disease.

                Dynamics of excitable cells and networks depend on the membrane time constant, set by membrane resistance and capacitance. Whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of ionic conductances are routine in electrophysiology, experimental control over capacitance remains a challenge. Here, we present capacitance clamp, an approach that allows to mimic a modified capacitance in biological neurons via an unconventional application of the dynamic clamp technique. We first demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively modulate capacitance in a mathematical neuron model and then confirm the functionality of capacitance clamp in in vitro experiments in granule cells of rodent dentate gyrus with up to threefold virtual capacitance changes. Clamping of capacitance thus constitutes a novel technique to probe and decipher mechanisms of neuronal signaling in ways that were so far inaccessible to experimental electrophysiology.

                Voluntary movements are accompanied by increased oscillatory activity or synchronization in the gamma range (> 25.5 Hz) within the sensorimotor system. Despite the extensive literature about movement-related gamma synchronization, the specific role of gamma oscillations for movement control is still debated. In this study, we characterized movement-related gamma oscillatory dynamics and its relationship with movement characteristics based on 256-channels EEG recordings in 64 healthy subjects while performing fast and uncorrected reaching movements to targets located at three distances. We found that movement-related gamma synchronization occurred during both movement planning and execution, albeit with different gamma peak frequencies and topographies. Also, the amplitude of gamma synchronization in both planning and execution increased with target distance. Additional analysis of phase coherence revealed a gamma-coordinated long-range network involving occipital, frontal and central regions during movement execution. Gamma synchronization amplitude and phase coherence pattern reliably predicted peak velocity amplitude and timing, thus suggesting that cortical gamma oscillations play a significant role in the selection of appropriate kinematic parameters during planning and in their implementation during movement execution.

                Objectives: Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. Brain injury can activate the microglia and induce its directional migration towards injury sites for exerting immune functions. While extracellular ATP released from the injury site mediates the directionality of activated microglia's migration, what endows activated microglia with migration capability remains largely unexplored. Methods: In the present study, we used the larval zebrafish as an in vivo model to visualize the dynamics of both morphology and Ca2+ activity of microglia during its migration evoked by local brain injury. Results: We found that, in response to local injury, activated microglia exhibited an immediate Ca2+ transient and later elevated Ca2+ bursts frequency during its migration towards the local injury site (P < 0.01). Furthermore, suppression of Ca2+ activities significantly retarded microglial migration (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Thus, our study suggests that intracellular Ca2+ activity is required for activated microglia's migration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The use of principal component analysis to measure fundamental cognitive processes in neuropsychological data</a></h4>

              
                For years, dissociation studies on neurological single cases were the dominant method to infer fundamental cognitive functions in neuropsychology. In contrast, the association between deficits was considered to be of less epistemological value and even misleading. Still, principal component analysis (PCA), an associational method for dimensionality reduction, recently became popular for the identification of fundamental functions. The current study evaluated the ability of PCA to identify the fundamental variables underlying a battery of measures. Synthetic data were simulated to resemble typical neuropsychological data, including varying dissociation patterns. In most experiments, PCA succeeded to measure the underlying target variables with high up to almost perfect precision. However, this success relied on additional factor rotation. Unroated PCA struggled with the dependence of data and often failed. On the other hand, the performance of rotated factor solutions required single measures that anchored the rotation. When no test scores existed that primarily and precisely measured each underlying target variable, rotated solutions also failed their intended purpose. Further, the dimensionality of the simulated data was consistently underestimated. Commonly used strategies to estimate the number of meaningful factors appear to be inappropriate for neuropsychological data. Finally, simulations suggested a high potential of PCA to denoise data, with factor rotation providing an additional filter function. This can be invaluable in neuropsychology, where measures are often inherently noisy, and PCA can be superior to common compound measures - such as the arithmetic mean - in the measurement of variables with high reliability. In summary, PCA appears to be a powerful tool in neuropsychology that is well capable to infer fundamental cognitive functions with high precision, but the typical structure of neuropsychological data places clear limitations and a risk of a complete methodological failure on the method.

                Schizophrenia has a complex etiology and symptomatology that is difficult to untangle. After decades of research, important advancements towards a central biomarker are still lacking. One of the missing pieces is a better understanding of how non-linear neural dynamics are altered in this patient population. In this study, the resting-state neuromagnetic signals of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were analyzed in the framework of criticality. When biological systems like the brain are in a state of criticality, they are thought to be functioning at maximum efficiency (e.g., optimal communication and storage of information) and with maximum adaptability to incoming information. Here, we assessed the self-similarity and multifractality of resting-state brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography in patients with schizophrenia patients and in matched controls. Our analysis showed a clear ascending, rostral to caudal gradient of self-similarity values in healthy controls, and an opposite gradient for multifractality (descending values, rostral to caudal). Schizophrenia patients had similar, although attenuated, gradients of self-similarity and multifractality values. Statistical tests showed that patients had higher values of self-similarity than controls in fronto-temporal regions, indicative of more regularity and memory in the signal. In contrast, patients had less multifractality than controls in the parietal and occipital regions, indicative of less diverse singularities and reduced variability in the signal. In addition, supervised machine-learning, based on logistic regression, successfully discriminated the two groups using measures of self-similarity and multifractality as features. Our results provide new insights into the baseline cognitive functioning of schizophrenia patients by identifying key alterations of criticality properties in their resting-state brain data.

                Interoceptors, sensory neurons that monitor internal organs and states, are essential for physiological homeostasis and generating internal perceptions. Here we describe a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of interoceptors of the mouse lung, defining 10 molecular subtypes that differ in developmental origin, myelination, receptive fields, terminal morphologies, and cell contacts. Each subtype expresses a unique but overlapping combination of sensory receptors that detect diverse physiological and pathological stimuli, and each can signal to distinct sets of lung cells including immune cells, forming a local neuroimmune interaction network. Functional interrogation of two mechanosensory subtypes reveals exquisitely-specific homeostatic roles in breathing, one regulating inspiratory time and the other inspiratory flow. The results suggest that lung interoceptors encode diverse and dynamic sensory information rivaling that of canonical exteroceptors, and this information is used to drive myriad local cellular interactions and enable precision control of breathing, while providing only vague perceptions of organ states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PatchWarp: Corrections of non-uniform image distortions in two-photon calcium imaging data by patchwork affine transformations</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon microscopy has been widely used to record the activity of populations of individual neurons at high spatial resolution in behaving animals. The ability to perform imaging for an extended period of time allows the investigation of activity changes associated with behavioral states and learning. However, imaging often accompanies shifts of the imaging field, including rapid (~100ms) translation and slow, spatially non-uniform distortion. To combat this issue and obtain a stable time series of the target structures, motion correction algorithms are commonly applied. However, typical motion correction algorithms are limited to full field translation of images and are unable to correct non-uniform distortions. Here, we developed a novel algorithm, PatchWarp, to robustly correct slow image distortion for calcium imaging data. PatchWarp is a two-step algorithm with rigid and non-rigid image registrations. To correct non-uniform image distortions, it splits the imaging field and estimates the best affine transformation matrix for each of the subfields. The distortion-corrected subfields are stitched together like a patchwork to reconstruct the distortion-corrected imaging field. We show that PatchWarp robustly corrects image distortions of calcium imaging data collected from various cortical areas through glass window or GRIN lens with a higher accuracy than existing non-rigid algorithms. Furthermore, it provides a fully automated method of registering images from different imaging sessions for longitudinal neural activity analyses. PatchWarp improves the quality of neural activity analyses and would be useful as a general approach to correct image distortions in a wide range of disciplines.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to death and disability, resulting in an enormous individual and socio-economic challenges. Despite huge efforts, there are still controversies on treatment strategies and early outcome estimation. We evaluate current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TBI according to their fulfillment of the CONSORT (Consolidated Statement of Reporting Trials) statement’s criteria as a marker of transparency and the quality of study planning and realization. A PubMed search for RCTs on TBI (January 2014–December 2019) was carried out. After screening of the abstracts (n = 1.926), the suitable full text manuscripts (n = 72) were assessed for the fulfillment of the CONSORT criteria. The mean ratio of consort statement fulfillment was 59% (±13%), 31% of the included studies (n = 22) complied with less than 50% of the CONSORT criteria. Citation frequency was moderately related to ratio of CONSORT item fulfillment (r = 0.4877; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and citation frequency per year (r = 0.5249; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The ratio of CONSORT criteria fulfillment was associated with the impact factor of the publishing journal (r = 0.6428; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Essential data for study interpretation, such as sample size determination (item 7a), participant flow (item 13a) as well as losses and exclusions (item 13b), were only reported in 53%, 60% and 63%, respectively. Reporting and methodological aspects in RCTs on TBI still may be improved. Thus, the interpretation of study results may be hampered due to methodological weaknesses.</p>

	<p>One of the core problems for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is the impairment of their ability to walk, which can be severely restrictive in everyday life. Therefore, monitoring of ambulatory function is of great importance to be able to effectively counteract disease progression. An extensive gait analysis, such as the Dresden protocol for multidimensional walking assessment, covers several facets of walking impairment including a 2-min walk test, in which the distance taken by the patient in two minutes is measured by an odometer. Using this approach, it is questionable how precise the measuring methods are at recording the distance traveled. In this project, we investigate whether the current measurement can be replaced by a digital measurement method based on accelerometers (six Opal sensors from the Mobility Lab system) that are attached to the patient’s body. We developed two algorithms using these data and compared the validity of these approaches using the results from 2-min walk tests from 562 pwMS that were collected with a gold-standard odometer. In 48.4% of pwMS, we detected an average relative measurement error of less than 5%, while results from 25.8% of the pwMS showed a relative measurement error of up to 10%. The algorithm had difficulties correctly calculating the walking distances in another 25.8% of pwMS; these results showed a measurement error of more than 20%. A main reason for this moderate performance was the variety of pathologically altered gait patterns in pwMS that may complicate the step detection. Overall, both algorithms achieved favorable levels of agreement (r = 0.884 and r = 0.980) with the odometer. Finally, we present suggestions for improvement of the measurement system to be implemented in the future.</p>

	<p>One fundamental principle of the brain functional organization is the elaboration of sensory information for the specification of action plans that are most appropriate for interaction with the environment. Using an incidental go/no-go priming paradigm, we have previously shown a facilitation effect for the execution of a walking-related action in response to far vs. near objects/locations in the extrapersonal space, and this effect has been called “macro-affordance” to reflect the role of locomotion in the coverage of extrapersonal distance. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of such an effect by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from 30 human participants during the same paradigm. The results of a whole-brain analysis indicated a significant modulation of the event-related potentials (ERPs) both during prime and target stimulus presentation. Specifically, consistent with a mechanism of action anticipation and automatic activation of affordances, a stronger ERP was observed in response to prime images framing the environment from a far vs. near distance, and this modulation was localized in dorso-medial motor regions. In addition, an inversion of polarity for far vs. near conditions was observed during the subsequent target period in dorso-medial parietal regions associated with spatially directed foot-related actions. These findings were interpreted within the framework of embodied models of brain functioning as arising from a mechanism of motor-anticipation and subsequent prediction error which was guided by the preferential affordance relationship between the distant large-scale environment and locomotion. More in general, our findings reveal a sensory-motor mechanism for the processing of walking-related environmental affordances.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) changes in insulo-opercular epilepsy (IOE) and after insulo-opercular surgery. Methods: We analyzed 5-min resting HRV of IOE patients before and after surgery. Patients’ SUDEP-7 risk inventory scores were also calculated. Results were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and healthy individuals. Results: There were no differences in HRV measurements between IOE, TLE, and healthy control groups (and within each IOE group and TLE group) in preoperative and postoperative periods. In IOE patients, the SUDEP-7 score was positively correlated with pNN50 (percentage of successive RR intervals that differ by more than 50 ms) (p = 0.008) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) (p = 0.019). We stratified IOE patients into those whose preoperative RMSSD values were below (Group 1a = 7) versus above (Group 1b = 9) a cut-off threshold of 31 ms (median value of a healthy population from a previous study). In group 1a, all HRV values significantly increased after surgery. In group 1b, time-domain parameters significantly decreased postoperatively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in IOE, HRV may be either decreased in parasympathetic tone or increased globally in both sympathetic and parasympathetic tones. We found no evidence that insulo-opercular surgeries lead to major autonomic dysfunction when a good seizure outcome is reached. The increase in parasympathetic tone observed preoperatively may be of clinical concern, as it was positively correlated with the SUDEP-7 score.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Accurate Localization of Linear Probe Electrode Arrays across Multiple Brains</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recently developed probes for extracellular electrophysiological recordings have large numbers of electrodes on long linear shanks. Linear electrode arrays, such as Neuropixels probes, have hundreds of recording electrodes distributed over linear shanks that span several millimeters. Because of the length of the probes, linear probe recordings in rodents usually cover multiple brain areas. Typical studies collate recordings across several recording sessions and animals. Neurons recorded in different sessions and animals thus have to be aligned to each other and to a standardized brain coordinate system. Here, we evaluate two typical workflows for localization of individual electrodes in standardized coordinates. These workflows rely on imaging brains with fluorescent probe tracks and warping 3D image stacks to standardized brain atlases. One workflow is based on tissue clearing and selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), whereas the other workflow is based on serial block-face two-photon (SBF2P) microscopy. In both cases electrophysiological features are then used to anchor particular electrodes along the reconstructed tracks to specific locations in the brain atlas and therefore to specific brain structures. We performed groundtruth experiments, in which motor cortex outputs are labeled with ChR2 and a fluorescence protein. Light-evoked electrical activity and fluorescence can be independently localized. Recordings from brain regions targeted by the motor cortex reveal better than 0.1-mm accuracy for electrode localization, independent of workflow used.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Drug Utilization Evaluation of Vancomycin among Patients in Jafar Ibn Auf Pediatric Hospital, 2018 [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vancomycin is an antibiotic of growing importance in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections; with a particular emphasis on its value in the fight against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Increasing reports of Vancomycin resistance have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this drug. Drug utilization evaluation has an important role in controlling rational use of antibiotics to prevent the emergence of resistance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective 6-months study at Jafar Ibn Auf pediatric hospital. Data including patient's demographics, diagnosis, Dosage regimen, and treatment duration were reviewed. The concordance of practice with the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines and principles of antibiotic therapy was assessed. Results: 127 medical records were reviewed in this study. Sepsis (29%) and Pneumonia (19.6%) were the most common indications. Culture test was requested in 20.5% of patients. Monitoring of serum creatinine was carried in 81.1% of patients. Based on HICPAC guidelines vancomycin was administered appropriately in 67.7% percent of cases. Considering the infusion rate, most of patients with specific order were received vancomycin in 1 hour. Conclusions: The results showed that vancomycin was used empirically without subsequent adjustment of the antimicrobial agent according to culture and sensitivity data and lack of paying enough attention to the infusion rate and serum creatinine monitoring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding free energy decomposition and multiple unbinding paths of buried ligands in a PreQ1 riboswitch</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guodong Hu, Huan-Xiang Zhou</p>

Riboswitches are naturally occurring RNA elements that control bacterial gene expression by binding to specific small molecules. They serve as important models for RNA-small molecule recognition and have also become a novel class of targets for developing antibiotics. Here, we carried out conventional and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, totaling 153.5 μs, to characterize the determinants of binding free energies and unbinding paths for the cognate and synthetic ligands of a PreQ<sub>1</sub> riboswitch. Binding free energy analysis showed that two triplets of nucleotides U6-C15-A29 and G5-G11-C16, contribute the most to the binding of the cognate ligands, by hydrogen bonding and by base stacking, respectively. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are essential in stabilizing the binding pocket. For the synthetic ligands, the hydrogen-bonding contributions of the U6-C15-A29 triplet are significantly compromised, and the bound state resembles the apo state in several respects, including the disengagement of the C15-A14-A13 and A32-G33 base stacks. The bulkier synthetic ligands lead to significantly loosening of the binding pocket, including extrusion of the C15 nucleobase and a widening of the C15-C30 groove. Enhanced-sampling simulations further revealed that the cognate and synthetic ligands unbind in almost opposite directions. Our work offers new insight for designing riboswitch ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic divisive normalization circuits explain and predict change detection in monkey area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Udo A. Ernst, Xiao Chen, Lisa Bohnenkamp, Fingal Orlando Galashan, Detlef Wegener</p>

Sudden changes in visual scenes often indicate important events for behavior. For their quick and reliable detection, the brain must be capable to process these changes as independently as possible from its current activation state. In motion-selective area MT, neurons respond to instantaneous speed changes with pronounced transients, often far exceeding the expected response as derived from their speed tuning profile. We here show that this complex, non-linear behavior emerges from the combined temporal dynamics of excitation and divisive inhibition, and provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis. A central prediction derived from this investigation is that attention increases the steepness of the transient response irrespective of the activation state prior to a stimulus change, and irrespective of the sign of the change (i.e. irrespective of whether the stimulus is accelerating or decelerating). Extracellular recordings of attention-dependent representation of both speed increments and decrements confirmed this prediction and suggest that improved change detection derives from basic computations in a canonical cortical circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the spatial and temporal constrains of the GABAergic influence on neuronal excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aniello Lombardi, Heiko J. Luhmann, Werner Kilb</p>

GABA (γ-amino butyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that can mediate depolarizing responses during development or after neuropathological insults. Under which conditions GABAergic membrane depolarizations are sufficient to impose excitatory effects is hard to predict, as shunting inhibition and GABAergic effects on spatiotemporal filtering of excitatory inputs must be considered. To evaluate at which reversal potential a net excitatory effect was imposed by GABA (E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup>), we performed a detailed in-silico study using simple neuronal topologies and distinct spatiotemporal relations between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.
These simulations revealed for GABAergic synapses located at the soma an E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> close to action potential threshold (E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>), while with increasing dendritic distance E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> shifted to positive values. The impact of GABA on AMPA-mediated inputs revealed a complex temporal and spatial dependency. E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> depends on the temporal relation between GABA and AMPA inputs, with a striking negative shift in E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> for AMPA inputs appearing after the GABA input. The spatial dependency between GABA and AMPA inputs revealed a complex profile, with E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> being shifted to values negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup> for AMPA synapses located proximally to the GABA input, while for distally located AMPA synapses the dendritic distance had only a minor effect on E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup>. For tonic GABAergic conductances E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> was negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup> over a wide range of g<sub>GABA</sub><sup>tonic</sup> values. In summary, these results demonstrate that for several physiologically relevant situations E<sub>GABA</sub><sup>Thr</sup> is negative to E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>, suggesting that depolarizing GABAergic responses can mediate excitatory effects even if E<sub>GABA</sub> did not reach E<sub>AP</sub><sup>Thr</sup>.

Many vaccine candidates with promising results in preclinical testing fail in human trials. New complex human tissue models have the potential to improve the predictability of vaccine safety and efficacy in human clinical trials.

There is a need for better models to improve preclinical testing of vaccines. This Perspective article argues that advanced mucosal human tissue models could present a solution to this pressing problem in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">FERONIA and microtubules independently contribute to mechanical integrity in the Arabidopsis shoot</a></h4>

To survive, cells must constantly resist mechanical stress. In plants, this involves the reinforcement of cell walls, notably through microtubule-dependent cellulose deposition. How wall sensing might contribute to this response is unknown. Here, we tested whether the microtubule response to stress acts downstream of known wall sensors. Using a multistep screen with 11 mutant lines, we identify FERONIA (FER) as the primary candidate for the cell’s response to stress in the shoot. However, this does not imply that FER acts upstream of the microtubule response to stress. In fact, when performing mechanical perturbations, we instead show that the expected microtubule response to stress does not require FER. We reveal that the <i>feronia</i> phenotype can be partially rescued by reducing tensile stress levels. Conversely, in the absence of both microtubules and FER, cells appear to swell and burst. Altogether, this shows that the microtubule response to stress acts as an independent pathway to resist stress, in parallel to FER. We propose that both pathways are required to maintain the mechanical integrity of plant cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A shared transcriptional code orchestrates temporal patterning of the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andreas Sagner, Isabel Zhang, Thomas Watson, Jorge Lazaro, Manuela Melchionda, James Briscoe</p>

The molecular mechanisms that produce the full array of neuronal subtypes in the vertebrate nervous system are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence of a global temporal patterning program comprising sets of transcription factors that stratifies neurons based on the developmental time at which they are generated. This transcriptional code acts throughout the central nervous system, in parallel to spatial patterning, thereby increasing the diversity of neurons generated along the neuraxis. We further demonstrate that this temporal program operates in stem cell−derived neurons and is under the control of the TGFβ signaling pathway. Targeted perturbation of components of the temporal program, Nfia and Nfib, reveals their functional requirement for the generation of late-born neuronal subtypes. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a previously unappreciated global temporal transcriptional program of neuronal subtype identity and suggest that the integration of spatial and temporal patterning mechanisms diversifies and organizes neuronal subtypes in the vertebrate nervous system.

                Background: Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is critical to enhancing the ability to control commercial activities and results in a competitive advantage when combined with an organisation's existing competitive advantages. However, our practise review reveals that end users resist ERP implementation because the resulting changes will alter the current status quo. The implementation of an ERP system in an organisation is complex as it affects multiple areas of the business. Resistance to change is cited as a factor of ERP failure. Methods: In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review using Transfield’s five stages and established a conceptual framework for ERP system implementation in science and technology parks (STPs). Articles collected from Emerald, Science Direct, ProQuest and Scopus databases between 1st June 2021 and 15th June 2021. Two authors were assigned to check the suitability of the articles in order to avoid risk of bias. Articles were analysed based on components of a research paper and the data was tabulated using MS Excel. Results: Only eight papers (0.011% of all the papers) appeared when we searched for papers related to ERP with a focus on post ERP Implementation, end-user behaviours, organisational performance, and the accelerated SAP (system application and product) methodology. We found that there are hardly any articles on ERP post implementations in STP context particularly based on the evaluation part of accelerated SAP.   Conclusions: Results indicate the lack of studies in this field, particularly those addressing issues related to STP. This study attempted to broaden the understanding of the ERP's effectiveness, particularly in terms of an organisation's operational performance.

<p>This observational cohort study aims to quantify disease burden over time, establish disease progression rates, and identify factors that may determine the disease course of Leigh syndrome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy-two Leigh syndrome children who completed the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) at baseline at 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–7.6) and follow-up assessments at 7.5 years (IQR = 3.7–11.0) in clinics were enrolled. Eighty-two percent of this cohort had a confirmed genetic diagnosis, with pathogenic variants in the <i>MT-ATP6</i> and <i>SURF1</i> genes being the most common cause. The total NPMDS scores denoted mild (0–14), moderate (15–25), and severe (&gt;25) disease burden. Detailed clinical, neuroradiological, and molecular genetic findings were also analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median total NPMDS scores rose significantly (<i>Z</i> = −6.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of children with severe disease burden doubled (22% → 42%) over 2.6 years of follow-up. Poor function (especially mobility, self-care, communication, feeding, and education) and extrapyramidal features contributed significantly to the disease burden (<i>τ</i>
<sub>b</sub> ≈ 0.45–0.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). These children also deteriorated to wheelchair dependence (31% → 57%), exclusive enteral feeding (22% → 46%), and one-to-one assistance for self-care (25% → 43%) during the study period. Twelve children (17%) died after their last NPMDS scores were recorded. These children had higher follow-up NPMDS scores (disease burden; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and steeper increase in NPMDS score per annum (disease progression; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Other predictors of poor outcomes include <i>SURF1</i> gene variants (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and bilateral caudate changes on neuroimaging (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study has objectively defined the disease burden and progression of Leigh syndrome. Our analysis has also uncovered potential influences on the trajectory of this neurodegenerative condition. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 impact: Customised economic stimulus package recommender system using machine learning techniques [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Malaysian government reacted to the pandemic’s economic effect with the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to cushion the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) impact on households. The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled “Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,” collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques—Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.  Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HIV index testing services in urban Lusaka: a retrospective review of medical records [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As the proportions of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who do not know their HIV infection status decrease, reaching the remaining few who are asymptomatic and not in contact with the health care system becomes a critical challenge. Therefore, reaching the first 90 of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets will require effective and efficient HIV testing approaches. The number of PLHIV who know their HIV status and who receive antiretroviral therapy could increase by the expansion of index testing services. Methods: This project was a retrospective study looking at medical records of HIV positive clients who were elicited for index testing between October and December 2019. It was conducted in three high volume health facilities in Matero Urban sub-district 3 in Lusaka, Zambia. Results: The HIV test outcomes for index contacts were as follows: 452 index contacts (53.5%) tested HIV negative, 113 index contacts (13.4%) tested HIV positive, 108 index contacts (12.8%) were known HIV positive, and 172 index contacts (20.4%) were not yet tested for HIV. Of the 113 contacts who tested HIV positive, 90 index contacts started anti-retroviral therapy within 7 days (79.6%). The total number of 845 contacts were elicited from 604 index clients, giving a low elicitation ratio of 1:1.4. There was not much difference between gender for elicited contacts (423 men and 422 women). A total number of 565 index contacts were eligible for HIV test. 113 of them tested HIV positive, representing a positivity yield of 20%. Pearson Chi-Square test value was 0.498 and the p value was 0.481. This result is not significant since p value (0.481) is greater than the designated alpha level (0.05). Conclusions: HIV programs need to explore and address barriers to HIV partner testing services to avoid over-testing and maximize HIV case identification (thus, improving HIV testing positivity yield).

     alt="Microstructural profiles of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness"/>
<p>Using the fixel-based analysis, we investigated white matter abnormalities of the thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness. Altered connections were mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices and were mainly attributed to the microstructural changes in axonal density.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity are crucial for consciousness; however, their microstructural changes in patients with a disorder of consciousness (DOC) have not yet been thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we applied the novel fixel-based analysis to comprehensively investigate the thalamus-related microstructural abnormalities in 10 patients with DOC using 7-T diffusion-weighted imaging data. We found that compared to healthy controls, patients with DOC showed reduced fiber density (FD) and fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in the mediodorsal, anterior, and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei, while fiber-bundle cross-section (FC) was not significantly altered in the thalamus. Impaired thalamocortical connectivity in the DOC cohort was mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus, with predominant microstructural abnormalities in FD and FDC. Correlation analysis showed that FC of the right mediodorsal thalamus was negatively correlated with the level of consciousness. Our results suggest that microstructural abnormalities of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in DOC were mainly attributed to axonal injury. In particular, the microstructural integrity of the thalamus is a vital factor in consciousness generation.</p>

                Background: COVID-19 has shaken countries at all levels, putting public health at risk. Global efforts have allocated funding for the development of research for the development of vaccines, digital tools, epidemiologic, social, and economic studies. Although these efforts have been developed worldwide, not all countries have prioritized the same topics and may have a different impact on solving problems and containing the spread of COVID-19. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted with secondary data of "Special Projects COVID-19” in order to analyze the prioritization of proposals and projects to Peruvian needs in the face of pandemic. Two calls were made by the Peruvian research council (CONCyTec); the first with five areas and the second with seven. The global amounts financed by each call were 342,857 USD (1,200,000 soles) and 700,000 USD (1,750,000 soles), respectively. Results: A total of 1,101 research projects were presented, 600 (54.5%) in the first call. In this call, 176 (29.3%) projects were from technological development and innovation and 29 were winners (with a global budget of 1,711,907.25 USD /6,077,270.75 soles). In the second call, 120 (23.9%) projects were from the area of Social and economic research and 21 were winners (global budget of 1,284,002.25 USD/558,208.55 soles) (p=0.043). The largest proportion of winning projects in both calls was 12 (41.4%) in Technological developments and innovation, then five (17.2%) each in telehealth and mobile health, and epidemiological and social studies. Across both calls, 214 (55.8%) and 160 (51.9%) projects were of private organizations and universities, respectively. Conclusions: This research shows ~2% of rapid response "Special Projects COVID-19” were financed by the CONCyTec call with over a million dollars of funds. Although the main topics were technological innovation, detection systems, and vaccines, these priorities have not had a global impact on the epidemiological development of the pandemic in Peru.

                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely adopted affordable method for large scale gene expression profiling. However, user-friendly and versatile tools for wet-lab biologists to analyse RNA-seq data beyond standard analyses such as differential expression, are rare. Especially, the analysis of time-series data is difficult for wet-lab biologists lacking advanced computational training. Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species. With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data. RNfuzzyApp offers several methods for normalization and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, providing easy-to-use toolboxes, interactive plots and downloadable results. For time-series analysis, RNfuzzyApp presents the first web-based, fully automated pipeline for soft clustering with the Mfuzz R package, including methods to aid in cluster number selection, cluster overlap analysis, Mfuzz loop computations, as well as cluster enrichments. RNfuzzyApp is an intuitive, easy to use and interactive R shiny app for RNA-seq differential expression and time-series analysis, offering a rich selection of interactive plots, providing a quick overview of raw data and generating rapid analysis results. Furthermore, its assignment of orthologs, enrichment analysis, as well as ID conversion functions are accessible to non-model organisms.

                Increasing cases of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, requires healthcare systems to provide essential palliative care for critically ill patients and their families. With the rapid onset and often accelerated deterioration in patients with acute conditions, palliative and supportive care for these patients have different characteristics compared to those for chronic diseases. Furthermore, providing end-of life services for critically ill patients with acute diseases and their families to ensure good death for the patients, will also have its own challenges. This scoping review aims to explore the concept of palliative care and good death for acute diseases. This scoping review will be conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley's framework for scoping reviews: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data, collating, summarizing, reporting results, and conducting consultation. All original research with a focus on palliative care and good death due to acute diseases will be included. This review will include all original research designs published between the period of 2000–2021 that describe a measure of palliative care management for and good death due to acute diseases. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies will be included in order to consider different aspects of healthcare services. This review will also include guidelines and gray literature on palliative care and good deaths. The search will be conducted through PubMed, Scopus Database, and ScienceDirect using the key terms related to acute disease palliative care and the concept of good death due to acute diseases. Two authors will screen the titles and abstracts of the studies. Two authors will review the full text of selected studies independently and extract the data. All selected studies will be synthesized qualitatively, and the results will be consulted with experts through discussion and depict the current concept of palliative care and good death in acute diseases.

                In mice performing a complex decision-making task, Koay et al. find that cortical neural populations jointly encode multiple task variables from sensory to cognitive in a way that approximately cancels out time-dependent behavioral correlations between variables. They show that dynamic encoding functions are theoretically implementable with static task-input synapses.
