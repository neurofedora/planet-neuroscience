              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Examination of Diurnal Variation and Sex Differences in Hippocampal Neurophysiology and Spatial Memory</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Circadian rhythms are biological processes that cycle across 24 h and regulate many facets of neurophysiology, including learning and memory. Circadian variation in spatial memory task performance is well documented; however, the effect of sex across circadian time (CT) remains unclear. Additionally, little is known regarding the impact of time-of-day on hippocampal neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the influence of both sex and time-of-day on hippocampal neurophysiology and memory in mice. Performance on the object location memory (OLM) task depended on both circadian time and sex, with memory enhanced at night in males but during the day in females. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses was greater at night compared with day in both sexes. Next, we measured spontaneous synaptic excitation and inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Frequency and amplitude of inhibition was greater during the day compared with night, regardless of sex. Frequency and amplitude of excitation was larger in females, compared with males, independent of time-of-day, although both time-of-day and sex influenced presynaptic release probability. At night, CA1 pyramidal neurons showed enhanced excitability (action potential firing and/or baseline potential) that was dependent on synaptic excitation and inhibition, regardless of sex. This study emphasizes the importance of sex and time-of-day in hippocampal physiology, especially given that many neurologic disorders impacting the hippocampus are linked to circadian disruption and present differently in men and women. Knowledge about how sex and circadian rhythms affect hippocampal physiology can improve the translational relevancy of therapeutics and inform the appropriate timing of existing treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Exposure Dysregulates Nucleus Basalis Magnocellularis Afferents in the Basolateral Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulate the acquisition and consolidation of fear-like and anxiety-like behaviors. However, it is unclear whether the alterations in the NBM-BLA circuit promote negative affect during ethanol withdrawal (WD). Therefore, we performed <I>ex vivo</I> whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in both the NBM and the BLA of male Sprague Dawley rats following 10 d of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure and 24 h of WD. We found that CIE exposure and withdrawal enhanced the neuronal excitability of NBM putative "cholinergic" neurons. We subsequently used optogenetics to directly manipulate NBM terminal activity within the BLA and measure cholinergic modulation of glutamatergic afferents and BLA pyramidal neurons. Our findings indicate that CIE and withdrawal upregulate NBM cholinergic facilitation of glutamate release via activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Ethanol withdrawal-induced increases in NBM terminal activity also enhance BLA pyramidal neuron firing. Collectively, our results provide a novel characterization of the NBM-BLA circuit and suggest that CIE-dependent modifications to NBM afferents enhance BLA pyramidal neuron activity during ethanol withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulation of Synaptic and Developmental Transcriptomic/Proteomic Profiles upon Depletion of MUNC18-1</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Absence of presynaptic protein MUNC18-1 (gene: <I>Stxbp1</I>) leads to neuronal cell death at an immature stage before synapse formation. Here, we performed transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of immature <I>Stxbp1</I> knock-out (KO) cells to discover which cellular processes depend on MUNC18-1. Hippocampi of <I>Stxbp1</I> KO mice showed cell type-specific dysregulation of 2123 transcripts primarily related to synaptic transmission and immune response. To further investigate direct, neuron-specific effects of MUNC18-1 depletion, a proteomic screen was performed on murine neuronal cultures at two developmental timepoints before onset of neuron degeneration. 399 proteins were differentially expressed, which were primarily involved in synaptic function (especially synaptic vesicle exocytosis) and neuron development. We further show that many of the downregulated proteins on loss of MUNC18-1 are normally upregulated during this developmental stage. Thus, absence of MUNC18-1 extensively dysregulates the transcriptome and proteome, primarily affecting synaptic and developmental profiles. Lack of synaptic activity is unlikely to underlie these effects, as the changes were observed in immature neurons without functional synapses, and minimal overlap was found to activity-dependent proteins. We hypothesize that presence of MUNC18-1 is essential to advance neuron development, serving as a "checkpoint" for neurons to initiate cell death in its absence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Different levels of circadian (de)synchrony ­– where does it hurt? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A network of cellular timers ensures the maintenance of homeostasis by temporal modulation of physiological processes across the day. These so-called circadian clocks are synchronized to geophysical time by external time cues (or zeitgebers). In modern societies, natural environmental cycles are disrupted by artificial lighting, around-the-clock availability of food or shiftwork. Such contradictory zeitgeber input promotes chronodisruption, i.e., the perturbation of internal circadian rhythms, resulting in adverse health outcomes. While this phenomenon is well described, it is still poorly understood at which level of organization perturbed rhythms impact on health and wellbeing. In this review, we discuss different levels of chronodisruption and what is known about their health effects. We summarize the results of disrupted phase coherence between external and internal time vs. misalignment of tissue clocks amongst each other, i.e., internal desynchrony. Last, phase incoherence can also occur at the tissue level itself. Here, alterations in phase coordination can emerge between cellular clocks of the same tissue or between different clock genes within the single cell. A better understanding of the mechanisms of circadian misalignment and its effects on physiology will help to find effective tools to prevent or treat disorders arising from modern-day chronodisruptive environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Avian influenza (H5N1) virus, epidemiology and its effects on backyard poultry in Indonesia: a review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Avian influenza (AI) is a zoonotic viral endemic disease that affects poultry, swine, and mammals, including humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is caused by influenza type A virus subtypes H5, and H7 which are naturally carried by a wild bird and often affect domestic poultry. Avian influenza (AI) is a major problem worldwide that causes significant economic losses in the poultry sector. Since 2003, the widespread H5N1 HPAI in poultry has led to high mortalities resulting in huge economic losses in the poultry sector in Indonesia. Domestic poultry is a key source of income that contributes to economic growth, both directly and indirectly, by reducing poverty among the people living in rural communities. Furthermore, in many developing countries, including Indonesia, rural people meet a portion of their food needs through backyard poultry. Nevertheless, this sector is strongly affected by biosecurity hazards, particularly in Indonesia by HPAI infections. Avian influenza (AI), subtype H5N1 has zoonotic significance, posing major risks to public health and poultry. Due to close interaction between wild migratory birds and ducks, the domestic poultry sector in Indonesia is directly affected by this virus. This virus continues to be ubiquitous in Indonesia as a result of the unpredictable mutations produced by antigenic drift and shift, which can persist from a few days to several years. In this review, the epidemiology and impact, of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype virus infection on backyard poultry in Indonesia were discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Environmental Uncertainty as a Moderator of Entrepreneurship Orientation and Innovation Capability during the Pandemic: A Case of Written Batik SMEs in Yogyakarta [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Written batik is one of Indonesia's cultural heritages that must be preserved. During the Covid-19 pandemic, written batik producers in Indonesia experienced increasing challenges due to the uncertainty of the business environment. Innovation is a solution to the problems faced by SMEs during a pandemic to survive. This study aims to examine the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability. This study also examines the role of moderating environmental uncertainty in strengthening the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability. Methods: The research was conducted at the centre of small and medium-sized batik companies Giriloyo, Bantul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Respondents of this study were 130 small and medium companies selected by random sampling. The questionnaire is used as a primary data collection tool. WarpPLS has been used to analyze the effect between variables in this study. Results: Entrepreneurship orientation is an important aspect in improving the innovation capabilities of SMEs. Environmental uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capabilities. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that entrepreneurship orientation has a significant effect on innovation capabilities. Environmental uncertainty significantly strengthens the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability.

                <p>by Alfonso Nieto-Castanon</p>

Current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging technology is able to resolve billions of individual functional connections characterizing the human connectome. Classical statistical inferential procedures attempting to make valid inferences across this many measures from a reduced set of observations and from a limited number of subjects can be severely underpowered for any but the largest effect sizes. This manuscript discusses fc-MVPA (functional connectivity Multivariate Pattern Analysis), a novel method using multivariate pattern analysis techniques in the context of brain-wide connectome inferences. The theory behind fc-MVPA is presented, and several of its key concepts are illustrated through examples from a publicly available resting state dataset, including an analysis of gender differences across the entire functional connectome. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of this method. In addition to offering powerful whole-brain inferences, fc-MVPA also provides a meaningful characterization of the heterogeneity in functional connectivity across subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Incomplete bunyavirus particles can cooperatively support virus infection and spread</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erick Bermúdez-Méndez, Kirsten F. Bronsvoort, Mark P. Zwart, Sandra van de Water, Ingrid Cárdenas-Rey, Rianka P. M. Vloet, Constantianus J. M. Koenraadt, Gorben P. Pijlman, Jeroen Kortekaas, Paul J. Wichgers Schreur</p>

Bunyaviruses lack a specific mechanism to ensure the incorporation of a complete set of genome segments into each virion, explaining the generation of incomplete virus particles lacking one or more genome segments. Such incomplete virus particles, which may represent the majority of particles produced, are generally considered to interfere with virus infection and spread. Using the three-segmented arthropod-borne Rift Valley fever virus as a model bunyavirus, we here show that two distinct incomplete virus particle populations unable to spread autonomously are able to efficiently complement each other in both mammalian and insect cells following co-infection. We further show that complementing incomplete virus particles can co-infect mosquitoes, resulting in the reconstitution of infectious virus that is able to disseminate to the mosquito salivary glands. Computational models of infection dynamics predict that incomplete virus particles can positively impact virus spread over a wide range of conditions, with the strongest effect at intermediate multiplicities of infection. Our findings suggest that incomplete particles may play a significant role in within-host spread and between-host transmission, reminiscent of the infection cycle of multipartite viruses.

                The mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unclear. In this review, we examine potential mechanism that may explain why the sense of smell is lost or altered. Among the current hypotheses, the most plausible is that death of infected support cells in the olfactory epithelium causes – besides altered composition of the mucus – retraction of the cilia on olfactory receptor neurons, possibly because of lack of support-cell derived glucose in the mucus that powers olfactory signal transduction within the cilia.

                IFN-Is are pleiotropic cytokines enriched in the tumor microenvironment. Chen et al. show that a high IFN-I-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in CD8+ T cells correlates with poor survival and anti-PD-1 therapy resistance in patients with cancer. Mechanistically, chronic IFN-I signaling induces lipid peroxidation that drives terminal exhaustion of intratumoral CD8+ T cells.

                Oo et al. report an essential role for the lncRNA PCAT19 in the endothelial cell proliferation-quiescence switch. Endothelial cell-enriched PCAT19 is upregulated with quiescence and binds RPA2 to prevent aberrant phosphorylation of RPA2-S33 by ATR kinase. This ensures an appropriate DNA damage response for the endothelial cell-cycle state.

                Shankar et al. show that a kinesin Kif2A bearing microtubule-depolymerizing activity is recruited to the cilium basal body via the γ-TuRC subunits GCP2 and Mzt2. The γ-TuRC-Kif2A-dependent pathway promotes cilia disassembly, preventing ciliogenesis. Functional heterogeneity of γ-TuRC at the basal body facilitates microtubule nucleation and Kif2A recruitment, modulating ciliogenesis.

Contrary to the long-held belief that epididymal maturation is primarily driven by the uptake/modification of additional proteins, this work demonstrates that spermatozoa shed over half their protein composition during this process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting parental roles shape sex differences in poison frog space use but not navigational performance</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences in spatial abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Taxonium, a web-based tool for exploring large phylogenetic trees</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a step change in the scale of sequencing data, with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth. These sequences reveal key insights when represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus, and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring phylogenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for SARS-CoV-2. We have developed Taxonium, a new tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium links each node to associated metadata and supports mutation-annotated trees, which are able to capture all known genetic variation in a dataset. It can either be run entirely locally in the browser, from a serverbased backend, or as a desktop application. We describe insights that analysing a tree of five million sequences can provide into SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and provide a tool at cov2tree.org for exploring a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Taxonium can be applied to any tree, and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel cis-regulatory element drives early expression of Nkx3.2 in the gnathostome primary jaw joint</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of movable jaws was a major event during vertebrate evolution. The role of NK3 homeobox 2 (Nkx3.2) transcription factor in patterning the primary jaw joint of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) is well known, however knowledge about its regulatory mechanism is lacking. In this study, we report a proximal enhancer element of <i>Nkx3.2</i> that is deeply conserved in most gnathostomes but undetectable in the jawless hagfish and lamprey. This enhancer is active in the developing jaw joint region of the zebrafish <i>Danio rerio</i>, and was thus designated as <i>jaw joint regulatory sequence 1</i> (JRS1). We further show that JRS1 enhancer sequences from a range of gnathostome species, including a chondrichthyan and mammals, have the same activity in the jaw joint as the native zebrafish enhancer, indicating a high degree of functional conservation despite the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fish lineages or the transition of the primary jaw joint into the middle ear of mammals. Finally, we show that deletion of JRS1 from the zebrafish genome using CRISPR/Cas9 results in a significant reduction of early gene expression of <i>nkx3.2</i> and leads to a transient jaw joint deformation and partial fusion. Emergence of this <i>Nkx3.2</i> enhancer in early gnathostomes may have contributed to the origin and shaping of the articulating surfaces of vertebrate jaws.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mandrill mothers associate with infants who look like their own offspring using phenotype matching</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral discrimination of kin is a key process structuring social relationships in animals. In this study, we provide evidence for discrimination towards non-kin by third-parties through a mechanism of phenotype matching. In mandrills, we recently demonstrated increased facial resemblance among paternally related juvenile and adult females indicating adaptive opportunities for paternal kin recognition. Here, we hypothesize that mandrill mothers use offspring’s facial resemblance with other infants to guide offspring’s social opportunities towards similar-looking ones. Using deep learning for face recognition in 80 wild mandrill infants, we first show that infants sired by the same father resemble each other the most, independently of their age, sex or maternal origin, extending previous results to the youngest age class. Using long-term behavioral observations on association patterns, and controlling for matrilineal origin, maternal relatedness and infant age and sex, we then show, as predicted, that mothers are spatially closer to infants that resemble their own offspring more, and that this maternal behavior leads to similar-looking infants being spatially associated. We then discuss the different scenarios explaining this result, arguing that an adaptive maternal behavior is a likely explanation. In support of this mechanism and using theoretical modeling, we finally describe a plausible evolutionary process whereby mothers gain fitness benefits by promoting nepotism among paternally related infants. This mechanism, that we call ‘second-order kin selection’, may extend beyond mother-infant interactions and has the potential to explain cooperative behaviors among non-kin in other social species, including humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular mechanisms underlying central sensitization in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain disorders are often associated with negative emotions, including anxiety and depression. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during central pain development. Prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent development of chronic pain remains unknown. Here, we investigated the cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or chemogenetic inactivation of the somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented the chronification of pain. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that the CeA-SST neurons had increased excitatory synaptic drive and enhanced neuronal excitability in the chronic pain states. Finally, either chemogenetic inactivation of the CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of the nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to the CeA-SST neurons alleviated chronic pain and anxio-depressive symptoms. These data raise the possibility of targeting treatments to CeA-SST neurons to prevent central pain sensitization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary gain and loss of a plant pattern-recognition receptor for HAMP recognition</a></h4>

              
                As a first step in innate immunity, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize distinct pathogen and herbivore-associated molecular patterns and mediate activation of immune responses, but specific steps in the evolution of new PRR sensing functions are not well understood. We employed comparative genomic and functional analyses to define evolutionary events leading to the sensing of the herbivore-associated peptide inceptin (In11) by the PRR Inceptin Receptor (INR) in legume plant species. Existing and <i>de novo</i> genome assemblies revealed that the presence of a functional <i>INR</i> gene corresponded with ability to respond to In11 across ~53 million years (my) of evolution. In11 recognition is unique to the clade of Phaseoloid legumes, and only a single clade of INR homologues from Phaseoloids was functional in a heterologous model. The syntenic loci of several non-Phaseoloid outgroup species nonetheless contain non-functional INR-like homologues, suggesting that an ancestral gene insertion event and diversification preceded the evolution of a specific INR receptor function ~28 mya. Chimeric and ancestrally reconstructed receptors indicated that 16 amino acid differences in the C1 leucine-rich repeat domain and C2 intervening motif mediate gain of In11 recognition. Thus, high PRR diversity was likely followed by a small number of mutations to expand innate immune recognition to a novel peptide elicitor. Analysis of INR evolution provides a model for functional diversification of other germline-encoded PRRs.

                Precise synaptic connection of neurons with their targets is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A plethora of signaling pathways act in concert to mediate the precise spatial arrangement of synaptic connections. Here we show a novel role for a gap junction protein in controlling tiled synaptic arrangement in the GABAergic motor neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, in which their axons and synapses overlap minimally with their neighboring neurons within the same class. We found that while EGL-20/Wnt controls axonal tiling, their presynaptic tiling is mediated by a gap junction protein UNC-9/Innexin, that is localized at the presynaptic tiling border between neighboring dorsal D-type GABAergic motor neurons. Strikingly, the gap junction channel activity of UNC-9 is dispensable for its function in controlling tiled presynaptic patterning. While gap junctions are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system as channels, our finding uncovered the novel channel-independent role of UNC-9 in synapse patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosshair, semi-automated targeting for electron microscopy with a motorised ultramicrotome</a></h4>

              
                Volume electron microscopy (EM) is a time-consuming process – often requiring weeks or months of continuous acquisition for large samples. In order to compare the ultrastructure of a number of individuals or conditions, acquisition times must therefore be reduced. For resin-embedded samples, one solution is to selectively target smaller regions of interest by trimming with an ultramicrotome. This is a difficult and labour-intensive process, requiring manual positioning of the diamond knife and sample, and much time and training to master. Here, we have developed a semi-automated workflow for targeting with a modified ultramicrotome. We adapted two recent commercial systems to add motors for each rotational axis (and also each translational axis for one system), allowing precise and automated movement. We also developed a user-friendly software to convert X-ray images of resin-embedded samples into angles and cutting depths for the ultramicrotome. This is provided as an open-source Fiji plugin called Crosshair. This workflow is demonstrated by targeting regions of interest in a series of <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> samples.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patterns of interdivision time correlations reveal hidden cell cycle factors</a></h4>

              
                The time taken for cells to complete a round of cell division is a stochastic process controlled, in part, by intracellular factors. These factors can be inherited across cellular generations which gives rise to, often non-intuitive, correlation patterns in cell cycle timing between cells of different family relationships on lineage trees. Here, we formulate a framework of hidden inherited factors affecting the cell cycle that unifies known cell cycle control models and reveals three distinct interdivision time correlation patterns: aperiodic, alternator and oscillator. We use Bayesian inference with single-cell datasets of cell division in bacteria, mammalian and cancer cells, to identify the inheritance motifs that underlie these datasets. From our inference, we find that interdivision time correlation patterns do not identify a single cell cycle model but generally admit a broad posterior distribution of possible mechanisms. Despite this unidentifiability, we observe that the inferred patterns reveal interpretable inheritance dynamics and hidden rhythmicity of cell cycle factors. This reveals that cell cycle factors are commonly driven by circadian rhythms, but their period may differ in cancer. Our quantitative analysis thus reveals that correlation patterns are an emergent phenomenon that impact cell proliferation and these patterns may be altered in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Promoter sequence and architecture determine expression variability and confer robustness to genetic variants</a></h4>

              
                Genetic and environmental exposures cause variability in gene expression. Although most genes are affected in a population, their effect sizes vary greatly, indicating the existence of regulatory mechanisms that could amplify or attenuate expression variability. Here, we investigate the relationship between the sequence and transcription start site architectures of promoters and their expression variability across human individuals. We find that expression variability can be largely explained by a promoter's DNA sequence and its binding sites for specific transcription factors. We show that promoter expression variability reflects the biological process of a gene, demonstrating a selective trade-off between stability for metabolic genes and plasticity for responsive genes and those involved in signaling. Promoters with a rigid transcription start site architecture are more prone to have variable expression and to be associated with genetic variants with large effect sizes, while a flexible usage of transcription start sites within a promoter attenuates expression variability and limits genotypic effects. Our work provides insights into the variable nature of responsive genes and reveals a novel mechanism for supplying transcriptional and mutational robustness to essential genes through multiple transcription start site regions within a promoter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endocytic trafficking determines cellular tolerance of presynaptic opioid signaling</a></h4>

              
                Opioid tolerance is well described physiologically but its mechanistic basis remains incompletely understood. An important site of opioid action in vivo is the presynaptic terminal, where opioids inhibit transmitter release. This response characteristically resists desensitization over minutes yet becomes gradually tolerant over hours, and how this is possible remains unknown. Here we delineate a cellular mechanism underlying this longer-term form of opioid tolerance in cultured rat medium spiny neurons. Our results support a model in which presynaptic tolerance is mediated by a gradual depletion of cognate receptors from the axon surface through iterative rounds of receptor endocytosis and recycling. For the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), we show that the agonist-induced endocytic process which initiates iterative receptor cycling requires GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail, and that partial or biased agonist drugs with reduced ability to drive phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis in terminals produce correspondingly less presynaptic tolerance. We then show that the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) conforms to the same general paradigm except that presynaptic endocytosis of DOR, in contrast to MOR, does not require phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail. Further, we show that DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR in axons and, consistent with this, that DOR tolerance develops more strongly. Together, these results delineate a cellular basis for the development of presynaptic tolerance to opioids and describe a methodology useful for investigating presynaptic neuromodulation more broadly.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A guide for writing anti-racist tenure and promotion letters</a></h4>

              
                In a two-page tenure letter, senior faculty can make or break a career. This power has an outsized impact on Black academics and other scholars with marginalized identities, who are awarded tenure at lower rates than their white colleagues. We suggest that this difference in tenure rates is due to an implicit, overly narrow definition of academic excellence that does not recognize all the contributions that Black scholars make to their departments, institutions and academia in general. These unrecognized contributions include the (often invisible) burdens of mentoring and representation that these scholars bear disproportionately. Here we propose a set of practical steps for writing inclusive, anti-racist tenure letters, including what to do before writing the letter, what to include (and not include) in the letter itself, and what to do after writing the letter to further support the candidate seeking tenure. We are a group of mostly non-Black academics in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) based in the United States who are learning about and working toward Black liberation in academia; we hope these recommendations will help ongoing efforts to move toward an inclusive academia that appreciates and rewards diverse ways of doing, learning and knowing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Viewpoint-Dependence and Scene Context Effects Generalize to Depth Rotated 3D Objects.</a></h4>

              
                Viewpoint effects on object recognition interact with object-scene consistency effects. While recognition of objects seen from "accidental" viewpoints (e.g., a cup from below) is typically impeded compared to processing of objects seen from canonical viewpoints (e.g., the string- side of a guitar), this effect is reduced by meaningful scene context information. In the present study we investigated if these findings established by using photographic images, generalise to 3D models of objects. Using 3D models further allowed us to probe a broad range of viewpoints and empirically establish accidental and canonical viewpoints. In Experiment 1, we presented 3D models of objects from six different viewpoints (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300) in colour (1a) and grayscaled (1b) in a sequential matching task. Viewpoint had a significant effect on accuracy and response times. Based on the performance in Experiments 1a and 1b, we determined canonical (0-rotation) and non-canonical (120-rotation) viewpoints for the stimuli. In Experiment 2, participants again performed a sequential matching task, however now the objects were paired with scene backgrounds which could be either consistent (e.g., a cup in the kitchen) or inconsistent (e.g., a guitar in the bathroom) to the object. Viewpoint interacted significantly with scene consistency in that object recognition was less affected by viewpoint when consistent scene information was provided, compared to inconsistent information. Our results show that viewpoint-dependence and scene context effects generalize to depth rotated 3D objects. This supports the important role object-scene processing plays for object constancy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent dysregulation of locus coeruleus firing in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous feature of prodromal Alzheimers disease (AD), and LC neurons degenerate as AD progresses. Tau-mediated LC dysfunction may contribute to early neuropsychiatric symptoms, while loss of LC integrity is associated with conversion to cognitive impairment. Hyperphosphorylated tau alters firing rates in other brain regions, but its effects on LC neurons have not been described. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in firing properties of LC neurons when they are the only cells containing hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as later in disease when {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau pathology is abundant in the forebrain. Single unit LC activity was recorded from anesthetized wild-type (WT) and TgF344-AD rats, which carry the APP/PS1 transgene. Similar to human AD, these rats develop hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC (at 6 months) prior to A{beta} or tau pathology in forebrain regions (at 12-15 months). At baseline, LC neurons from TgF344-AD rats were hypoactive at both ages compared to WT littermates, but showed elevated spontaneous bursting properties, particularly in younger animals. Differences in footshock-evoked LC firing depended on age, with 6-month TgF344-AD rats demonstrating aspects of hyperactivity, and aged transgenic rats showing hypoactivity relative to WT. Tau-induced alterations in LC firing rates may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD, with early hyperactivity associated with prodromal symptoms, followed by hypoactivity contributing to cognitive impairment. These results support further investigation into disease stage-dependent noradrenergic interventions for AD.

                The disruption of cortical assembly activity has been associated with anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. However, information about the relationship between cortical assembly activity and the variations in consciousness associated with natural vigilance states is currently lacking. To address this, we performed vigilance state-specific clustering analysis on 2-photon calcium imaging data from sensorimotor cortex in combination with global EEG microstate analysis derived from multi-EEG signals obtained from widespread cortical locations. Our analysis revealed no difference in the structure of assembly activity during quiet wakefulness (QW), NREMs, or REMs, despite the latter two vigilance states being associated with significantly reduced levels of consciousness relative to QW. However, we found a significant coordination between global EEG microstate dynamics and local cortical assembly activity during periods of QW, but not sleep. These results suggest that the coordination of cortical assembly activity with global brain dynamics could be a key factor of sustained conscious experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elevated alpha-synuclein attenuates phagocytosis in SNCA triplication human iPSC-derived neuron:microglia co-cultures</a></h4>

              
                Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by pathologic production, aggregation, and cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein that results in impaired cellular function. While neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta express high levels of alpha-synuclein and are highly vulnerable to its aberrant expression or conformation, brain-resident macrophages (microglia) are also sensitive to abnormal alpha-synuclein, with recent reports indicating that elevated levels impair phagocytic ability in vivo and in vitro. To explore the impact of elevated alpha-syn on microglial function we employed a co-culture model containing iPSC-derived neurons and microglia-like cells. iPSCs from healthy control donors and a Parkinson's donor with an allelic triplication of the SNCA gene locus were differentiated into neurons and microglia-like cells. In monoculture, neurons and microglia generated from the SNCA triplication donor expressed higher levels of SNCA transcript and protein. Neurons were found to have significantly greater expression of SNCA compared to microglia, regardless of donor genotype. Co-cultures of neurons and microglia revealed that microglia cultured with SNCA triplication neurons displayed reduction in phagocytosis of fluorescent E. coli, irrespective of microglia donor genotype. SNCA mRNA and protein expression could be reduced with treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting SNCA. ASO treatment partially rescued microglia phagocytosis in SNCA triplication co-cultures and in co-cultures containing SNCA triplication neurons and healthy control microglia. Our results complement and extend previous findings of impaired microglial function in the presence of elevated alpha-synuclein in a novel patient-derived co-culture model that utilizes more disease-relevant conditions rather than the relaying on the addition of exogenous alpha-synuclein.

                Background: Obligate blood-feeding insects obtain the nutrients and water necessary to ensure survival from the vertebrate blood. The internal taste sensilla, situated in the pharynx, evaluate the suitability of the ingested food. Here, through multiple approaches, we characterized the pharyngeal organ (PO) of the hematophagous kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus to determine its role in food assessment. The PO, located antero-dorsally in the pharynx, comprises 8 taste sensilla that become bathed with the incoming blood. Results: We showed that these taste sensilla house gustatory receptor neurons projecting their axons through the labral nerves to reach the subesophageal zone in the brain. We found that these neurons are electrically activated by relevant appetitive and aversive gustatory stimuli such as NaCl, ATP and caffeine. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the expression of sensory-related gene families in the PO. We identified gustatory receptors, ionotropic receptors, transient receptor potential channels, pickpocket channels, opsins, takeouts, neuropeptide precursors, neuropeptide receptors and biogenic amine receptors. RNA interference assays demonstrated that the pickpocket channel Rproppk014276 is necessary for salt detection during feeding. Conclusion: We provide evidence of the role of the pharyngeal organ in food evaluation. This work shows the first comprehensive characterization of a pharyngeal taste organ in a hematophagous insect.

                Background: Common neural underpinning of Parkinson's Disease (PD) psychosis across different structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies remains unclear to this day with few studies and even fewer meta-analyses available. Objectives: Our meta-analysis aimed to identify and summarise studies using MRI approach to identify PD psychosis-specific brain regions and examine the relation between cortical volume loss and dopaminergic and serotonergic receptor density. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase were searched for MRI studies of PD psychosis (PDP) compared to PD patients without psychosis (PDnP). Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images was applied in the meta-analysis where coordinates were available. Multiple linear regressions to examine the relationship between grey matter volume loss in PDP and receptor gene expression density (extracted from the Allen Human Brain Atlas) were conducted in R. Results: We observed lower grey matter volume in parietal-temporo-occipital regions from our meta-analysis (N studies =10, PDP n=211, PDnP, n=298). These results remained significant after adjusting for PD medications and for cognitive scores. Grey matter volume loss in PDP was associated with local expression of 5-HT1a (b=0.109, p=0.012) and 5-HT2a receptors (b=-0.106, p=0.002) also after adjusting for PD medications (5-HT1a, p = 0.005; 5-HT2a, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Widespread cortical volume loss in the parieto-temporo-occipital regions involved in information processing and integration, as well as attention, could result in PD psychosis symptoms. Neurobiological mechanisms implicating serotonergic receptors may also contribute to this condition.

                Many bimanual activities of daily living require quick shifts between symmetric and asymmetric motor output generated by the right and left hand. Bimanual motor control has been mostly studied during continuous repetitive tasks, while little research has been carried out in experimental settings requiring dynamic changes in motor output generated by both hands. Here, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while healthy volunteers performed a visually guided, bimanual pinch force task. This enabled us to map functional activity and connectivity of premotor and motor areas during bimanual pinch force control in different task contexts, requiring mirror-symmetric or inverse-asymmetric changes in discrete pinch force exerted with the right and left hand. The bilateral dorsal premotor cortex showed increased activity and effective coupling to the ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) in the inverse-asymmetric context compared to the mirror-symmetric context of bimanual pitch force control. Compared to unilateral pinches, all bimanual pinch force conditions were characterized by an increased level of activation in the bilateral primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) and stronger coupling from SMA to the ipsilateral M1-HAND. Task-related activity of a cluster in the left caudal SMA scaled positively with the degree of synchronous initiation of bilateral pinch force adjustments, irrespectively of the task context. The results suggest that the dorsal premotor cortex mediates increasing complexity of bimanual coordination by increasing coupling to the SMA-M1 network.

                In this work, we expand the normative model repository introduced in (Rutherford, Fraza, et al., 2022) to include normative models charting lifespan trajectories of structural surface area and brain functional connectivity, measured using two unique resting-state network atlases (Yeo17 and Smith-10), and an updated online platform for transferring these models to new data sources. We showcase the value of these models with a head to head comparison between the features output by normative modeling and raw data features in several benchmarking tasks: mass univariate group difference testing (schizophrenia versus control), classification (schizophrenia versus control), and regression (predicting general cognitive ability). Across all benchmarks, we confirm the advantage (i.e., stronger effect sizes, more accurate classification and prediction) of using normative modeling features. We intend for these accessible resources to facilitate wider adoption of normative modeling across the neuroimaging community.

                The waking brain's ubiquitous alpha oscillations are thought to play an important role in managing the brain's resources, inhibiting neural activity as a function of their phase and amplitude. In accordance with this physiological excitability, perceptual and cognitive processes fluctuate with alpha oscillations. Here we demonstrate that the alpha rhythm can be manipulated with sound in a phase-dependent manner, showing that repeated phase-locked sounds alter the frequency of these oscillations in a spatially localised manner. We draw on oscillator theory to explore the origin of this frequency change, using phase-locked auditory evoked potentials to show a putative phase-reset mechanism, which is dependent on the amplitude of the endogenous alpha oscillations. Finally, we demonstrate the functional relevance of this approach by showing that we can modulate the transition to sleep, using sound, in a phase-dependent manner. Overall, we conclude that the phase of alpha oscillations can be exploited in real time, and highlight alpha phase-locked auditory stimulation as a powerful method by which to both selectively augment and investigate the brain's pertinent oscillations.

                When single cones are stimulated with spots of 543-nm light presented against a white background, subjects report percepts that vary between predominately red, white, and green. However, light of the same spectral composition viewed over a large field under normal viewing conditions looks invariably green and highly saturated. It remains unknown what stimulus parameters are most important for governing the color appearance in the transition between these two extreme cases. The current study varied the size, intensity and retinal motion of stimuli presented in an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Stimuli were either stabilized on target locations or allowed to drift across the retina with the eye's natural motion. Increasing both stimulus size and intensity led to higher likelihoods that monochromatic spots of light were perceived as green, while only higher intensities led to increases in perceived saturation. The data also show an interaction between size and intensity, suggesting that the balance between magnocellular and parvocellular activation may be critical factors for color perception. Surprisingly, under the range of conditions tested, color appearance did not depend on whether stimuli were stabilized or not. Sequential activation of many cones does not appear to drive hue and saturation perception as effectively as simultaneous activation of many cones.

                1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an important non-invasive tool for measuring brain metabolism, with numerous applications in the neuroscientific and clinical domains. In this work we present a new analysis pipeline (SLIPMAT), designed to extract high-quality, tissue-specific, spectral profiles from MR spectroscopic imaging data (MRSI). Spectral decomposition is combined with spatially dependant frequency and phase correction to yield high SNR white and grey matter spectra without partial-volume contamination. A subsequent series of spectral processing steps are applied to reduce unwanted spectral variation, such as baseline correction and linewidth matching, before direct spectral analysis with machine learning and traditional statistical methods. The method is validated using a 2D semi-LASER MRSI sequence, with a 5-minute duration, from data acquired in triplicate across 8 healthy participants. Reliable spectral profiles are confirmed with principal component analysis, revealing the importance of total-choline and scyllo-inositol levels in distinguishing between individuals - in good agreement with our previous work. Furthermore, since the method allows the simultaneous measurement of metabolites in grey and white matter, we show the strong discriminative value of these metabolites in both tissue types for the first time. In conclusion, we present a novel and time efficient MRSI acquisition and processing pipeline, capable of detecting reliable neuro-metabolic differences between healthy individuals, and suitable for the sensitive neurometabolic profiling of in-vivo brain tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-strata co-occurrence of ripples with theta-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus of foraging rats</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivation: Brain rhythms have been postulated to play central roles in animal cognition. A prominently reported dichotomy of hippocampal rhythms, driven primarily by historic single-strata recordings, assigns theta-frequency oscillations (4-12 Hz) and ripples (120-250 Hz) to be exclusively associated with preparatory and consummatory behaviors, respectively. However, due to the differential power expression of these two signals across hippocampal strata, reports of such exclusivity require validation through simultaneous multi-strata recordings and cross-strata analysis of these oscillatory patterns. Methodology: We assessed co-occurrence of theta-frequency oscillations with ripples in multi-channel recordings of extracellular potentials across hippocampal strata from foraging rats. We detected all ripple events from an identified stratum pyramidale (SP) channel based on rigorous thresholds relating to the spectro-temporal and spatial characteristics of ripples. We then defined theta epochs based on theta oscillations detected from each of the different channels spanning the SP to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) through the stratum radiatum (SR). We calculated the proportion of ripples embedded within theta epochs. Results: We found ~20% (across rats) of ripple events (in SP) to co-occur with theta epochs identified from SR/SLM channels, defined here as theta ripples. All characteristics of theta ripples were comparable with ripples that occurred in the absence of theta oscillations. Furthermore, the power of theta oscillations in the immediate vicinity of theta ripples was similar to theta power across identified theta epochs, together validating the identification process of theta ripples. Strikingly, when theta epochs were instead identified from the SP channel, such co-occurrences were significantly lower in number. The reduction in the number of theta ripples was consequent to progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis. We assessed the behavioral state of rats during ripple events and found most theta ripples to occur during immobile periods. We confirmed that across sessions and rats, the theta power observed during exploratory theta epochs was comparable with theta power during immobile theta epochs. In addition, the progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis was common to both exploratory and immobile periods. Finally, we found a strong theta-phase preference of theta ripples within the third quadrant [3{pi}/2-2{pi}] of the associated theta oscillation. Implications: Our analyses provide direct quantitative evidence for the occurrence of ripple events nested within theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus. These analyses emphasize that the prevalent dichotomy about the manifestation of theta-frequency oscillations and ripples needs to be reevaluated, after explicitly accounting for the differential stratum-dependent expression of these two oscillatory patterns. The prevalence of theta ripples expands the potential roles of ripple-frequency oscillations to span the continuum of encoding, retrieval, and consolidation, achieved through interactions with theta oscillations.

                Psilocin, the active compound in Psilocybe sp. mushrooms, is a serotonergic psychedelic that has recently gained renewed interest due to its potential as a therapeutic tool. Despite promising clinical findings, the underlying signaling mechanisms and brain region-specific effects of psilocin and other psychedelic drugs remain unclear. Psilocin, like other psychedelic compounds, is an agonist at many serotonin and other biogenic amine receptors; however, activation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is understood as the main molecular target for the psychoactive effects in animals and humans. 5-HT2ARs are abundantly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the biochemical actions of psilocin on PFC neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, we used in vitro slice electrophysiology to examine how psilocin acutely alters the activity and electrophysiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse PFC. Focal application of psilocin (10uM) onto nonspecified Layer 5 Pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic PFC of C57BL/6J mice produced variable effects on firing (increase, decrease, or no change). 5-HT2AR layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse prelimbic PFC were identified via labeling in a 5-HT2A-ERT2-Cre mouse crossed with an Ai9 tdTomato reporter. Focal application of psilocin increased firing in all identified 5-HT2AR neurons but did not result in any significant changes in synaptic transmission. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocin evokes strong firing changes in the PFC that are 5-HT2AR and Gq dependent, thereby providing valuable insights into the effects of psilocin on a brain region implicated in mediating psychedelic drug actions.

                The complex pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains elusive due to the molecular and cellular dynamics that lead to cognitive impairments and neurological disorders. These complex attributes contribute to the difficulties in the success of TBI therapeutic regimens. Previously, we showed the spatiotemporal effects of TBI as well as the ability of T4 administration to prevent the cognitive impairments induced by TBI. Here, we focus on understanding the mechanism involved in the ability of T4 to prevent the cognitive damage induced by TBI using a systems level approach. Using single cell sequencing of two tissues (hippocampus and frontal cortex) at three stages post injury, we identified astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells to be the most affected across both tissues and across timepoints after T4 treatment. We also identified key genes that were reversed after T4 treatment such as Mbp and Plp1. Oxidative phosphorylation, immune response, and nervous system related pathways were shown to be affected by T4 treatment. Our systems-level approach allows us to further understand the temporal and spatial dynamic reprogramming by T4 that prevents cognitive dysfunction induced by TBI.

                Recent work has claimed that the emergence of grid cells from trained path-integrator circuits is a more fragile phenomenon than previously reported. In this note we critically assess the main analysis and simulation results underlying this claim, within the proper context of previously published theoretical work. Our assessment reveals that the emergence of grid cells is entirely consistent with this prior theory: hexagonal grid cells robustly emerge precisely when prior theory predicts they should, and don't when prior theory predicts they should not.

                Songs of the Bengalese finch consist of variable sequences of syllables. The sequences follow probabilistic rules, and can be statistically described by partially observable Markov models (POMMs), which consist of states and probabilistic transitions between them. Each state is associated with a syllable, and one syllable can be associated with multiple states. This multiplicity of syllable to states association distinguishes a POMM from a simple Markov model, in which one syllable is associated with one state. The multiplicity indicates that syllable transitions are context-dependent. Here we present a novel method of inferring a POMM with minimal number of states from a finite number of observed sequences. We apply the method to infer POMMs for songs of six adult male Bengalese finches before and shortly after deafening. Before deafening, the models all require multiple states, but with varying degrees of state multiplicity for individual birds. Deafening reduces the state multiplicity for all birds. For three birds, the models become Markovian, while for the other three, the multiplicity persists for some syllables. These observations indicate that auditory feedback contributes to, but is not the only source of, the context dependencies of syllable transitions in Bengalese finch song.

                Functional connectivity (FC) can provide insight into cortical circuit dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, dynamic changes in FC related to locomotion with sensory feedback remain unexplored. To investigate FC dynamics in locomoting mice, we developed mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging with a virtual reality (VR) environment. We find rapid reorganization of cortical FC in response to changing behavioral states. Using machine learning classification, behavioral states are accurately decoded. We then use our VR-based imaging system to study cortical FC in a mouse model of autism and find that locomotion states are associated with altered FC dynamics. Furthermore, we identify FC patterns involving the motor area as the most distinguishing features of the autism mice from wild-type mice during behavioral transitions, which might correlate with motor clumsiness in patients with autism. Our VR-based real-time imaging system provides invaluable information to understand FC dynamics linked to a behavioral abnormality of neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Histopathological studies of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have found newly formed leaky vessels in demyelinated acute and chronic plaques, in addition to blood-brain barrier damage in existing vessels, that exacerbate disease pathology by increasing CNS infiltration of immune cells. However, which vessel subtypes and signaling pathways generate these aberrant vessels is poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo validation, we find that transcriptome signatures of neo-angiogenesis arise in venous endothelial cells in both acute and chronic EAE, and correlate with upregulation in VEGF-A signaling. These neo-angiogenic markers are also increased in human MS lesions. Treatment with a VEGF-A blocking antibody ameliorates EAE pathology by reducing neo-angiogenic transcriptomic signatures in vivo, suggesting that VEGF-A drives angiogenesis from vein ECs in EAE. Our findings suggest novel therapies targeting the vasculature that could benefit chronic MS.

                Deep learning methods trained on brain MRI data from one scanner or imaging protocol can fail catastrophically when tested on data from other sites or protocols - a problem known as domain shift. To address this, here we propose a domain adaptation method that trains a 3D CycleGAN (cycle-consistent generative adversarial network) to harmonize brain MRI data from 5 diverse sources (ADNI, WHIMS, OASIS, AIBL, and UK Biobank; total N=4,941 MRIs, age range: 46-96 years). The approach uses 2 generators and 2 discriminators to generate an image harmonized to a specific target dataset given an image from the source domain distribution and vice versa. We train the CycleGAN to jointly optimize an adversarial loss and cyclic consistency. We use a patch-based discriminator and impose identity loss to further regularize model training. To test the benefit of the harmonization, we show that brain age estimation - a common benchmarking task - is more accurate in GAN-harmonized versus raw data. t-SNE maps show the improved distributional overlap of the harmonized data in the latent space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the properties of the left angular gyrus using TMS-evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Background: The angular gyrus (AG) is involved in numerous cognitive processes, and structural alterations of the AG are reported in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Because abnormal excitability or connectivity of such cortical hubs could precede structural alterations and clinical symptoms, approaches assessing their functional state are needed. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) can provide such functional readouts by probing how the cortex responds to direct stimulation. Objective: To characterize TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) elicited by AG stimulation, determine optimal stimulation parameters, and identify TEP biomarkers of AG function. Methods: In 19 subjects, we recorded AG-TEPs using four TMS orientations and three intensities and compared their spatiotemporal features using topographic dissimilarity and microstate analyses. We also explored the link between AG-TEPs and TMS-evoked muscle activity. Results: Early AG TEP components of interest (P25, N45) showed topographic variability dependent on stimulation parameters. The P25 topography was sensitive to TMS orientation and less to intensity, whereas the N45 topography was highly dependent on both coil orientation and intensity. However, TMS-evoked muscular activity was also dependent on coil orientation and the dominant topography of N45 was strongly related to this muscular activity, indicating that the component may reflect somatosensory-evoked responses to this peripheral activation. Conclusions: The earliest AG TEP component P25 likely reflects neural processes triggered by direct AG activation and could provide an index of local excitability. N45 must be interpreted with caution as it may mostly reflect peripherally evoked activity. Coil orientation can be optimized to minimize muscular contractions.

                The preBotzinger complex of the lower brainstem generates two breathing-related rhythms: one for inspiration on a timescale of seconds, and another that produces larger amplitude sighs on the order of minutes. We hypothesize that these two disparate rhythms emerge in tandem wherein recurrent excitation gives rise to the inspiratory rhythm while a calcium oscillator generates sighs; distinct neuronal populations are not required. We present several mathematical models that instantiate our working hypothesis including: (1) an activity (firing rate) model and (2) a minimal spiking network model. Both modeling frameworks corroborate the single-population rhythmogenic hypothesis.

                Neuronal maturation is a process that plays a key role in the development and regeneration of the central nervous system. Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal neuronal maturation are less understood. Among the mechanisms influencing such neuronal maturation process, apoptosis plays a key role. Several regulators have been described to modulate apoptosis, including post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs. This study aimed to assess whether the strikingly induced miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation contributes to avoiding the neuronal death induced by apoptosis. Our results point out that the observed opposite expression of miR-138-5p and its target Caspase3 might modulate apoptosis favouring neuronal survival at distinct maturation stages. The unchanged expression of miR-138-5p in mature neurons contrasts with the significant downregulation in immature neurons upon apoptotic stimulation. Similarly, immunoblot and individual cellular assays confirmed that during maturation, not only the expression but processing of CASP-3 and caspase activity is reduced after apoptotic stimulation which resulted in a reduction of neuronal death. For all this data, we suggest that the upregulation of miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation is crucial in neuronal survival in pathological or traumatic conditions. Further studies would be needed to determine a more detailed role of miR-138-5p in apoptosis during neuronal maturation and the synergistic action of several microRNAs acting cooperatively on Caspase3 or other apoptotic targets.

                Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), also known as cavernous angiomas, are blood vessel abnormalities comprised of clusters of grossly enlarged and hemorrhage-prone capillaries. The prevalence in the general population, including asymptomatic cases, is estimated to be 0.5%. Some patients develop severe symptoms, including seizures and focal neurologic deficits, while others have no symptoms. The causes of this remarkable presentation heterogeneity within a primarily monogenic disease remain poorly understood. To address this problem, we have established a chronic mouse model of CCM, induced by postnatal ablation of Krit1 with Pdgfb-CreERT. These mice develop CCM lesions gradually over 4-6 months of age throughout of the brain. We examined lesion progression in these mice with T2-weighted 7T MRI protocols. Precise volumetric analysis of individual lesions revealed non-monotonous behavior, with some lesions temporarily growing smaller. However, the cumulative lesional volume invariably increased over time and accelerated after about 3 months. Next, we established a modified protocol for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR imaging and produced quantitative maps of gadolinium tracer MultiHance in the lesions, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity in lesional permeability. Multivariate comparisons of MRI properties of the lesions with cellular markers for endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia revealed that increased cell density surrounding lesions correlates with stability, while increased vasculature within and surrounding lesions may correlate with instability. Our results lay a foundation for better understanding individual lesion properties and provide a comprehensive pre-clinical platform for testing new drug and gene therapies for controlling CCM.

                Schizophrenia disease mechanisms remain poorly understood, in large part due to a lack of valid animal models. Rare heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, encoding a subunit of the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor, greatly increase the risk of schizophrenia. By transcriptomic, proteomic, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and behavioral analysis, we report that heterozygous Grin2a mutant mice show: (i) large-scale gene expression changes across multiple brain regions and in neuronal (excitatory and inhibitory) and non-neuronal cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes); (ii) evidence of reduced activity in prefrontal cortex and increased activity in hippocampus and striatum; (iii) elevated dopamine signaling in striatum; (iv) altered cholesterol biosynthesis in astrocytes; (v) reduction of glutamatergic receptor signaling proteins in the synapse; (iv) heightened gamma oscillation power in EEG; (vi) aberrant locomotor behavioral pattern opposite of that induced by antipsychotic drugs. These findings reveal potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, provide support for both the hypo-glutamate and hyper-dopamine hypotheses of schizophrenia, and underscore the utility of Grin2a-deficient mice as a new genetic model of schizophrenia.

                Predictive processing is quickly gaining ground as a theory of perception and attention. From this perspective the brain is cast as an organism's predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future. However, research on the brain's predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement. The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants' increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power. We discuss the limitations of our study preventing us from replicating previous research, and ways to remedy these shortcomings in future studies.

                We developed a new analytic tool based on visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF) to longitudinally track individual axon bundle transformation following acute optic nerve crush injury (ONC) in mice. We analyzed four parameters: lateral bundle width, axial bundle height, cross-sectional area, and the shape of individual bundles. We showed that axon bundles became wider and thicker at 3-days post ONC. The bundle swelling at 3-days post-ONC has correlated with about 15% retinal ganglion cell (RGC) soma loss. At 6-days post-ONC, axon bundles showed a significant reduction in lateral width and cross-sectional area, followed by a reduction in bundle height at 9-days post-ONC. Bundle shrinking at 9-days post-ONC has correlated with about 68% RGC soma loss. Both experimental and simulated results suggested that the cross-sectional area of individual RGC axon bundles is more sensitive than the bundle width and height to indicate RGC soma loss. This study is the first to track and quantify individual RGC axon bundles in vivo following ONC injury and establish the correlation between the morphological changes of RGC axon bundles and RGC soma loss.

                Conscious perception is thought to depend on global amplification of sensory input. In recent years, the basal ganglia have been implicated in gating conscious access due to their consistent involvement in thalamocortical loops. However, much of the evidence implicating the basal ganglia in these processes in humans is correlational. The current study is a preliminary investigation in four patients to explore whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the basal ganglia might improve conscious perception. In our study, treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients with a striatal DBS implant completed two canonical conscious perception tasks: emotion-induced blindness and backward masking. We found preliminary evidence in support of a role played by the basal ganglia in conscious perception at the behavioral level: patients performed better when stimulation was active, but we could not establish neural effects corresponding to these behavioral findings, possibly due to our small sample size. We discuss the potential implications and limitations of our study and delineate avenues for future research.

                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) represents a promising non-invasive treatment for an increasingly wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The ability to use periodically oscillating electric fields to non-invasively engage neural dynamics opens up the possibility of recruiting synaptic plasticity and to modulate brain function. However, despite consistent reports about tACS clinical effectiveness, strong state-dependence combined with the ubiquitous heterogeneity of cortical networks collectively results in high outcome variability. Introducing variations in intrinsic neuronal timescales, we explored how such heterogeneity influences stimulation-induced change in synaptic connectivity. We examined how spike timing dependent plasticity, at the level of cells, intra- and inter-laminar cortical networks, can be selectively and preferentially engaged by periodic stimulation. Using computational simulations informed by human experimental data, we analyzed cortical circuits comprised of multiple cell-types, alongside superficial multi-layered networks expressing distinct layer-specific timescales. Our results show that mismatch in neuronal timescales within and/or between cells - and the resulting variability in excitability, temporal integration properties and frequency tuning - enables selective and directional control on synaptic connectivity by tACS. Our work provides new vistas on how to recruit neural heterogeneity to guide brain plasticity using non-invasive stimulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Test-Retest Reliability of Dynamic Functional Connectivity Parameters for a Two-State Model</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) metrics derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) that measure dynamic features of brain communications that change over time are gaining more and more attention. A key concern is the reliability of DFC parameters, especially given the many methodological options. The DFC parameters mean dwell time (MDT), prevalence (Prev.), inter-transition interval (ITI) and state variability (Var.) were computed in 23 participants using a two-state model, sliding window analysis, and two imaging sessions. Reliability of the connectivity states, test-retest reliability of the parameters as well as correlations between DFC parameters were investigated for different scan lengths (i.e., 16 vs 8 min.), atlases (i.e., 116 vs. 442 regions of interest) and with/without within-subject centering of DFC matrices. The results showed an integrated (I) and a segregated (S) brain state with high intra-class correlation (ICC) values of the states between sessions (0.67 [&ge;] ICC [&ge;] 0.99). Reliability of the DFC parameters is, at best, intermediate with an ICC = 0.51 for prevalence for not-centered, 16 min. data and the coarse atlas. Moreover, MDTs of both states were positively correlated for centered data. Prevalence of one state was positively correlated with MDT of the same state and frequently negatively correlated with MDT of the other state. Var was positively correlated with MDT and Prev for the same state and negatively correlated for the other state for not-centered data. This study suggests that prevalence is the most reliable DFC parameter with lower reliability for shorter scans, more atlas regions and centering. Thus, it is advantageous to formulate hypotheses related to brain dynamics in terms of prevalence, especially in small-scale studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of fasting on ischemic infarcts in the rat</a></h4>

              
                Background: Inflammation has been found to be largely detrimental early in the acute phase of stroke but beneficial at more chronic stages. Fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation acutely. We aimed to determine whether post-ischemic fasting improves stroke outcomes through attenuated inflammation. Methods: After an endothelin-1 lesion was created in the striatum, animals were subjected to either normal feeding or water-only fasting for 24 hours. Results: It was found that at 24 hours, fasting reduced infarct volume and BBB breakdown and lowered both circulating and brain neutrophils. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fasting is a potentially beneficial non-pharmacological additive therapeutic option for cerebral ischemia, which might act by reducing inflammation in the acute disease stage.

	<p>The premutation expansion of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome has been linked to a range of clinical and subclinical features. Nearly half of men with FMR1 premutation develop a neurodegenerative disorder; Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). In this syndrome, cognitive executive decline and psychiatric changes may co-occur with major motor features, and in this study, we explored the interrelationships between these three domains in a sample of adult males affected with FXTAS. A sample of 23 adult males aged between 48 and 80 years (mean = 62.3; SD = 8.8), carrying premutation expansions between 45 and 118 CGG repeats, and affected with FXTAS, were included in this study. We employed a battery of cognitive assessments, two standard motor rating scales, and two self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms. When controlling for age and/or educational level, where appropriate, there were highly significant correlations between motor rating score for ICARS gait domain, and the scores representing global cognitive decline (ACE-III), processing speed (SDMT), immediate memory (Digit Span), and depression and anxiety scores derived from both SCL90 and DASS instruments. Remarkably, close relationships of UPDRS scores, representing the contribution of Parkinsonism to FXTAS phenotypes, were exclusive to psychiatric scores. Highly significant relationships between CGG repeat size and most scores for three phenotypic domains suggest a close tracking with genetic liability. These findings of relationships between a constellation of phenotypic domains in male PM carriers with FXTAS are reminiscent of other conditions associated with disruption to cerebro-cerebellar circuits.</p>

	<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation is a novel non-invasive technique for applying repetitive magnetic stimulation to the peripheral nerves and muscles. Contrarily, a person imagines that he/she is exercising during motor imagery. Resting-state electroencephalography can evaluate the ability of motor imagery; however, the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on resting-state electroencephalography are unknown. We examined the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography. The participants were divided into a motor imagery group and motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group. They performed 60 motor imagery tasks involving wrist dorsiflexion movement. In the motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group, we applied repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation to the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle during motor imagery. We measured the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography before and after the task. Both groups displayed a significant increase in the vividness of motor imagery. The motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group exhibited increased &amp;amp;beta; activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by source localization for electroencephalography. Hence, combined motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation changes the resting-state electroencephalography activity and may promote motor imagery.</p>

	<p>Cue reactivity (CR) among smokers exposed to smoking-related stimuli, both proximal (e.g., cigarettes, lighter) and distal (environments, people), has been well-demonstrated. Furthermore, past work has shown that combining proximal smoking cues with smoking environment cues increases cue-provoked craving and smoking behavior above that elicited by either cue type alone. In this pilot study, we examined the impact of combining three personal cues, proximal + environment + people, on subjective and behavioral cue reactivity among smokers. To further understand the impact of this method, we also tested reactivity under the conditions of both smoking satiety and deprivation. In addition, we examined the extent to which cue-induced craving predicted immediate subsequent smoking. Fifteen smokers completed six sessions, of which two focused on the intake and development of personal cues and four involved personal cue reactivity sessions: (1) deprived, smoking cue combination, (2) deprived, nonsmoking cue combination, (3) sated, smoking combination, and (4) sated, nonsmoking cue combination. Cue-provoked craving was greater and smokers were quicker to light a cigarette and smoked more during their exposure to smoking rather than nonsmoking cues and in deprived compared to sated conditions, with no interaction between these variables. While deprived, greater cue-provoked craving in response to smoking cues was correlated with a quicker latency to light a cigarette. This work supports the feasibility of presenting three personal smoking-related combinations of cues within a cue reactivity paradigm and highlights the robust reactivity that this methodology can evoke in smokers.</p>

	<p>For patients with disorders of consciousness, such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients and minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, their long treatment cycle and high cost commonly put a heavy burden on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s family and society. Therefore, it is vital to accurately diagnose and predict consciousness recovery for such patients. In this paper, we explored the role of the P300 signal based on an audiovisual BCI in the classification and prognosis prediction of patients with disorders of consciousness. This experiment included 18 patients: 10 UWS patients and 8 MCS- patients. At the three-month follow-up, we defined patients with an improved prognosis (from UWS to MCS-, from UWS to MCS+, or from MCS- to MCS+) as &amp;amp;ldquo;improved patients&amp;amp;rdquo; and those who stayed in UWS/MCS as &amp;amp;ldquo;not improved patients&amp;amp;rdquo;. First, we compared and analyzed different types of patients, and the results showed that the P300 detection accuracy rate of &amp;amp;ldquo;improved&amp;amp;rdquo; patients was significantly higher than that of &amp;amp;ldquo;not improved&amp;amp;rdquo; patients. Furthermore, the P300 detection accuracy of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients was significantly higher than that of non-traumatic brain injury (NTBI, including acquired brain injury and cerebrovascular disease) patients. We also found that there was a positive linear correlation between P300 detection accuracy and CRS-R score, and patients with higher P300 detection accuracy were likely to achieve higher CRS-R scores. In addition, we found that the patients with higher P300 detection accuracies tend to have better prognosis in this audiovisual BCI. These findings indicate that the detection accuracy of P300 is significantly correlated with the level of consciousness, etiology, and prognosis of patients. P300 can be used to represent the preservation level of consciousness in clinical neurophysiology and predict the possibility of recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), an age-progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive function, causes changes in the functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN). However, the question of whether AD-related changes occur in the functional connectivity of the basal ganglia has rarely been specifically analyzed. This study aimed to measure the changes in basal ganglia functional connectivity among patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in their resting state using the functional connectivity density (FCD) value, the functional connectivity (FC) intensity, and the graph theory index, and to confirm their influence on clinical manifestations. (2) Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological data from 48 participants in the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used for analyses. The 48 ADNI participants comprised 16 patients with AD, 16 patients with MCI, and 16 normal controls (NCs). The functional connectivity of basal ganglia was evaluated by FCDs, FC strength, and graph theory index. We compared voxel-based FCD values between groups to show specific regions with significant variation and significant connectivity from ROI conduction to ROI analysis. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analyses between functional connectivity and several simultaneous clinical variables were also conducted. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses associated with classification were conducted for both FCD values and graph theory indices. (3) Results: The level of FCD in patients with cognitive impairment showed obvious abnormalities (including short-range and long-range FCD). In addition to DMN-related regions, aberrant functional connectivity was also found to be present in the basal ganglia, especially in the caudate and amygdala. The FCD values of the basal ganglia (involving the caudate and amygdala) were closely related to scores from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ); meanwhile, the graph theory indices (involving global efficiency and degree) of the basal ganglia (involving the caudate, amygdala, and putamen) were also found to be closely correlated with MMSE scores. In ROC analyses of both FCD and graph theory, the amygdala was of the utmost importance in the early-stage detection of MCI; additionally, the caudate nucleus was found to be crucial in the progression of cognitive decline and AD diagnosis. (4) Conclusions: It was systematically confirmed that there is a phenomenon of change in the functional connections in the basal ganglia during cognitive decline. The findings of this study could improve our understanding of AD and MCI pathology in the basal ganglia and make it possible to propose new targets for AD treatment in further studies.</p>

	<p>Trait-related impulsiveness is highly prevalent in patients with mood disorders, being associated with negative outcomes. The predictive role of affective temperaments on trait-related impulsivity is still understudied. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between impulsivity and affective temperaments in a sample of euthymic patients with mood disorders. This is a real-world multicentric observational study, carried out at the outpatient units of seven university sites in Italy. All patients filled in the short version of Munster Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. The study sample included 653 participants, mainly female (58.2%), with a mean age of 46.9 (&amp;amp;plusmn;14.1). Regression analyses showed that higher levels of trait-related impulsivity were associated to suicide attempts (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.000), the presence of psychotic symptoms during acute phases (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), a seasonal pattern (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), a lower age at onset of the disorder (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), cyclothymic (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and irritable temperaments (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The results of our study highlight the importance to screen patients with mood disorders for impulsivity and affective temperaments in order to identify patients who are more likely to present a worse outcome and to develop personalized and integrated early pharmacological and psychosocial treatment plans. Novelties of the present paper include the recruitment of patients in a stable phase, which reduced possible bias in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; self-reports, and the multicentric nature of the study, resulting in the recruitment of a large sample of patients with mood disorders, geographically distributed across Italy, thus improving the generalizability of study results.</p>

	<p>The functioning of the brain has been a complex and enigmatic phenomenon. From the first approaches made by Descartes about this organism as the vehicle of the mind to contemporary studies that consider the brain as an organism with emergent activities of primary and higher order, this organism has been the object of continuous exploration. It has been possible to develop a more profound study of brain functions through imaging techniques, the implementation of digital platforms or simulators through different programming languages and the use of multiple processors to emulate the speed at which synaptic processes are executed in the brain. The use of various computational architectures raises innumerable questions about the possible scope of disciplines such as computational neurosciences in the study of the brain and the possibility of deep knowledge into different devices with the support that information technology (IT) brings. One of the main interests of cognitive science is the opportunity to develop human intelligence in a system or mechanism. This paper takes the principal articles of three databases oriented to computational sciences (EbscoHost Web, IEEE Xplore and Compendex Engineering Village) to understand the current objectives of neural networks in studying the brain. The possible use of this kind of technology is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can replicate more complex human brain tasks (such as those involving consciousness). The results show the principal findings in research and topics in developing studies about neural networks in computational neurosciences. One of the principal developments is the use of neural networks as the basis of much computational architecture using multiple techniques such as computational neuromorphic chips, MRI images and brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCI) to enhance the capacity to simulate brain activities. This article aims to review and analyze those studies carried out on the development of different computational architectures that focus on affecting various brain activities through neural networks. The aim is to determine the orientation and the main lines of research on this topic and work in routes that allow interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

	<p>In the post-COVID-19 era, significant changes have taken place regarding the epidemic, the economy, family and social life. However, it remains unclear how these changes encompass the psychological symptoms of college students. We carried out a cross-sectional study to investigate anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students from 10 November 2020, to 16 November 2020. The questionnaire included a self-designed canvas, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). Factors associated with psychological symptoms were estimated by ordered and non-conditional logistic regression analysis. Of 4754 participants, 25.0%, 29.7%, 3.4%, 15.3%, 17.1%, and 2.9% reported anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, one, any two, and all three, respectively. In cases with anxiety or depression symptoms, there was a 9.11% comorbidity with PTSD. Factors associated with fears of being infected, social, family, and economic changes increased the risk of psychological symptoms in college students caused by COVID-19. Female college students, identified with anxiety or depression symptoms, were at a lower risk of developing PTSD symptoms (OR, 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43&amp;amp;ndash;0.86). Non-medical majors at university, rural residence, higher educational background, fear of taking public transport, and deterioration of family relationships increased the risk for PTSD symptoms among male respondents with anxiety or depression symptoms due to COVID-19. Factors correlated with psychological symptoms had expanded from the fear of being infected to extensive social, family, and economic changes caused by COVID-19. Therefore, screening and interventions for psychological symptoms should be consistently strengthened and more targeted to college students in the post-COVID-19 era.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have found that statins may play a potential role in the age at onset (AAO) of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD). We performed this Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the association between genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with age at onset of HD. Methods: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMG-CoA reductase associated with LDL cholesterol in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis were used. The summary data of residual AAO of HD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis (n = 9064 HD patients). MR estimates representing lifelong inhibition of drug targets were generated using random-effects inverse-variance weighted analysis. Results: Genetically proxied plasma LDL cholesterol (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.039, 95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.454 to 0.531) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;2.228, 95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;4.830 to 0.374) were not associated with age at onset of HD. Conclusion: The plasma LDL cholesterol levels and the reduction of plasma LDL cholesterol levels by the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (i.e., statins) were not associated with the age of HD onset.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the age of children entering puberty is getting lower and the incidence of central precocious puberty is increasing. It is known that melatonin plays an increasingly important role in regulating animal reproduction, but the specific role and mechanism of melatonin in regulating the initiation of puberty remain unclear. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of subcutaneous melatonin injection on pubertal development in female mice and its mechanism of action. Female mice that were 22 days old received 1 mg/kg doses of melatonin subcutaneously every day for 10, 15 and 20 days. The vaginal opening was checked daily. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain was used to determine the growth of the uterus and ovaries. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone (GnIH), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in serum. By using RT-PCR and Western blotting, the mRNA and protein expression of the hypothalamus GnRH, GnIH, Kisspeptin (Kp), Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), Neuropeptide Y (NPY), as well as G protein-coupled receptor 147 (GPR147) were identified. The findings demonstrated that melatonin could suppress ovarian follicle and uterine wall growth as well as delay vaginal opening, decrease serum levels of GnRH and FSH and increase levels of GnIH. Melatonin increased GnIH and GPR147 expression in the hypothalamus in comparison to the saline group, while decreasing the expression of GnRH, Kisspeptin, POMC, and NPY. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin can inhibit the onset of puberty in female mice by modulating the expression of hypothalamic GnRH, GnIH, Kisspeptin, POMC and NPY neurons and suppressing the hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;gonadal axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Prospective Study of the Impact of Severe Childhood Deprivation on Brain White Matter in Adult Adoptees: Widespread Localized Reductions in Volume But Unaffected Microstructural Organization</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Early childhood neglect can impact brain development across the lifespan. Using voxel-based approaches we recently reported that severe and time-limited institutional deprivation in early childhood was linked to substantial reductions in total brain volume in adulthood, &gt;20 years later. Here, we extend this analysis to explore deprivation-related regional white matter volume and microstructural organization using diffusion-based techniques. A combination of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) analysis and tractography was conducted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from 59 young adults who spent between 3 and 41 months in the severely depriving Romanian institutions of the 1980s before being adopted into United Kingdom families, and 20 nondeprived age-matched United Kingdom controls. Independent of total volume, institutional deprivation was associated with smaller volumes in localized regions across a range of white matter tracts including (1) long-ranging association fibers such as bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), left superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLFs), and left arcuate fasciculus; (2) tracts of the limbic circuitry including fornix and cingulum; and (3) projection fibers with the corticospinal tract particularly affected. Tractographic analysis found no evidence of altered microstructural organization of any tract in terms of hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA), fractional anisotropy (FA), or mean diffusivity (MD). We provide further evidence for the effects of early neglect on brain development and their persistence in adulthood despite many years of environmental enrichment associated with successful adoption. Localized white matter effects appear limited to volumetric changes with microstructural organization unaffected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and Functional MRI Data Differentially Predict Chronological Age and Behavioral Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human cognitive abilities decline with increasing chronological age, with decreased explicit memory performance being most strongly affected. However, some older adults show "successful aging," that is, relatively preserved cognitive ability in old age. One explanation for this could be higher brain-structural integrity in these individuals. Alternatively, the brain might recruit existing resources more efficiently or employ compensatory cognitive strategies. Here, we approached this question by testing multiple candidate variables from structural and functional neuroimaging for their ability to predict chronological age and memory performance, respectively. Prediction was performed using support vector machine (SVM) classification and regression across and within two samples of young (<I>N</I> = 106) and older (<I>N</I> = 153) adults. The candidate variables were (1) behavioral response frequencies in an episodic memory test; (2) recently described functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scores reflecting preservation of functional memory networks; (3) whole-brain fMRI contrasts for novelty processing and subsequent memory; (4) resting-state fMRI maps quantifying voxel-wise signal fluctuation; and (5) gray matter volume estimated from structural MRIs. While age group could be reliably decoded from all variables, chronological age within young and older subjects was best predicted from gray matter volume. In contrast, memory performance was best predicted from task-based fMRI contrasts and particularly single-value fMRI scores, whereas gray matter volume has no predictive power with respect to memory performance in healthy adults. Our results suggest that superior memory performance in healthy older adults is better explained by efficient recruitment of memory networks rather than by preserved brain structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">P2X7 Receptor and Purinergic Signaling: Orchestrating Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the basic hallmarks of cellular pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Since the metabolic activity of neurons is highly dependent on energy supply, nerve cells are especially vulnerable to impaired mitochondrial function. Besides providing oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are also involved in controlling levels of second messengers such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, the critical role of mitochondria as producers of ROS is closely related to P2XR purinergic receptors, the activity of which is modulated by free radicals. Here, we review the relationships between the purinergic signaling system and affected mitochondrial function. Purinergic signaling regulates numerous vital biological processes in the CNS. The two main purines, ATP and adenosine, act as excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, respectively. Current evidence suggests that purinergic signaling best explains how neuronal activity is related to neuronal electrical activity and energy homeostasis, especially in the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s diseases. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the involvement of the P2RX7 purinoreceptor in triggering mitochondrial dysfunction during the development of neurodegenerative disorders. We also summarize various avenues by which the purine signaling pathway may trigger metabolic dysfunction contributing to neuronal death and the inflammatory activation of glial cells. Finally, we discuss the potential role of the purinergic system in the search for new therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Columnar Lesions in Barrel Cortex Persistently Degrade Object Location Discrimination Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Primary sensory cortices display functional topography, suggesting that even small cortical volumes may underpin perception of specific stimuli. Traditional loss-of-function approaches have a relatively large radius of effect (&gt;1 mm), and few studies track recovery following loss-of-function perturbations. Consequently, the behavioral necessity of smaller cortical volumes remains unclear. In the mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1), "barrels" with a radius of ~150 &mu;m receive input predominantly from a single whisker, partitioning vS1 into a topographic map of well defined columns. Here, we train animals implanted with a cranial window over vS1 to perform single-whisker perceptual tasks. We then use high-power laser exposure centered on the barrel representing the spared whisker to produce lesions with a typical volume of one to two barrels. These columnar-scale lesions impair performance in an object location discrimination task for multiple days without disrupting vibrissal kinematics. Animals with degraded location discrimination performance can immediately perform a whisker touch detection task with high accuracy. Animals trained <I>de novo</I> on both simple and complex whisker touch detection tasks showed no permanent behavioral deficits following columnar-scale lesions. Thus, columnar-scale lesions permanently degrade performance in object location discrimination tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 third wave in Myanmar following the military coup [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 seriously hit Myanmar between June and August 2021, a few months after the military coup, though the first and second waves in 2020 were managed effectively by the government. People in Myanmar experienced serious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated by the disorganized health system under the military junta. This study aimed to analyse the situation of COVID-19 occurrence and death proportions during its third wave in Myanmar. Methods: An online survey was conducted using a Google form. People with the symptoms of COVID-19 and those who died from COVID-19 between June and August 2021 were eligible to participate. The Google form was extracted into an Excel datasheet and analysed using Stata v16.1. Results: Among the 29,171 participants, 76.7% were over 30 years old and 56.4% were female. A majority of participants were from highly populated regions: Yangon (17,220; 59%) (Business capital), Mandalay (3,740; 12.8%) and Sagaing (1,546; 5.3%). Participants sought health care from telegram/other online services (34%), home care by health care providers (22%), private clinics (13%) and public hospitals run under the military junta (5%). Overall, 15% of participants died, of which, 72% occurred at home and 17% at public hospitals. Significantly higher proportions of deaths were seen among participants over 60 years than other age groups and males (p<0.001). Death proportions at different weeks from June to August 2021 ranged from 12.4% to 17.3%, much higher than the military junta’s reports. Overall, 25% of participants received oxygen therapy. Conclusions: Death proportions in different weeks were consistently over 12%. The majority of participants received tele/online and home treatment services. Most deaths occurred at home. Findings indicated the high COVID-19 case fatality rates with limited access to public hospital care during the third wave. The data suggests that the outcomes were adversely impacted by the military coup.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Antenatal care visits performance among unmarried women in Indonesia: Does unintended pregnancy matter? A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Unmarried women who experience unintended pregnancy tend to hide their pregnancy and not perform pregnancy care. The study analyzed the effect of unintended pregnancy on antenatal care (ANC) visits among unmarried women in Indonesia. Methods: The study employed secondary data from the 2017 IDHS. This cross-sectional study involved unmarried women aged 15-49 who gave birth in the last five years. The 2017 IDHS used stratification and multistage random sampling, and the task got 508 as weighted samples. The variables analyzed included ANC, unintended pregnancy, residence, age, marital, education, employment, wealth, and health insurance. The study used the binary logistic regression test at the final stage. Results: The results show that the proportion of unmarried women who have experienced an unintended pregnancy in the last five years in Indonesia is 26.0%. Unmarried women who had an unintended pregnancy were 0.588 times less likely than those who did not have an unintended pregnancy to have ANC visits ≥ four times (AOR 0.588; 95% CI 0.587-0.588). The analysis indicates that unmarried women who have unintended pregnancies in Indonesia are less likely to complete ANC visits. Conclusion: The study concluded that unmarried women who experienced unintended pregnancies in Indonesia were less likely to complete ANC visits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Takotsubo syndrome in a postoperative patient without cardiological disease [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is characterized by a clinical presentation that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is reversible. Alterations of Takotsubo in patients without previous heart disease remain a challenge for diagnosis. Case report: We present a case of an 80-year-old patient from Peru. The patient underwent surgery, with the diagnosis of Chilaiditi’s syndrome. One day after surgery, she presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and electrocardiographic changes (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and infrequent ventricular extrasystoles without abnormalities in the ST-segment). The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome with cardiogenic shock was made. She was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and was managed with vasopressors and nitroglycerin. There was no cardiac lesion in the cineangiogram or occlusion of arteries. The patient was extubated and received daily dialysis until discharge. Conclusions: Takotsubo is an emotional, non-cardiac, or post-traumatic stressful event that triggers myocardial injury with segmental anomalous, the possible etiology of which is the release of an endothelial neurotransmitter caused by stress. Emergency physicians should be aware of this as even patients without previous cardiac pathologies when exposed to stressors (such as surgeries) develop emergency symptomatology similar to myocardial infarction. Thus, emergency physicians should identify any cardiac abnormalities after a stressor, as well as be prepared for the diagnosis of TS.

                Introduction: CausalPath compares experimentally measured changes in molecular profiles against curated biological pathways and infers causality between changes in measured features from profiling experiments (e.g., RNA-seq or proteomics from total or phospho-protein levels). Methods: We developed the CausalPath Cytoscape App, an app (i.e., plugin) for visualizing results from the CausalPath method within the Cytoscape Java-based desktop network analysis and visualization platform. Use Cases:  Users are given instruction that represents use cases in multiple cancer research areas through the visualization of CausalPath analysis results generated from data by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. Discussion: The CausalPath Cytoscape App visualizes the set of known interactions that are supported by molecular profiling data via the CausalPath method. This integration of CausalPath and Cytoscape benefits users interested in performing secondary analyses (e.g., module detection) on the sub-networks that result from CausalPath analysis by utilizing the many analytical features available in the Cytoscape software ecosystem.

                Background: This study focused on evaluating the diversity and richness of the edaphic macrofauna in eight banana farms in the western zone of Nicaragua. Methods: The sampling design was random and descriptive, it was divided into two phases, the first was the collection of the sample, and the second was the classification, coding, and storage of the extracted macrofauna populations. Subsequently, the indices of diversity and species richness, relative abundance, by functional groups were estimated. Results: The results showed that the relative abundance of biodiversity was higher in the 0–20 cm soil depth stratum than in the branch and leaf biomass strata. The values ​​of the diversity indices of Dominion, Simpson, Shanon, Margalef, and Equity were in the normal range, with a tendency towards low diversity. Likewise, in the richness of species, the Dominant or most abundant genus were earthworms (Oligochaeta) and Hymenoptera (Solenopsis, Leptothorax, Camponotus, Pheidole), indicating the directly proportional relationship, that is to say, that the greater the number of earthworms the production increases and the greater the number of Hymenoptera it decreases, confirmed with the Pearson correlation coefficient with a reliability of 95%. Conclusions: It was concluded that based on the estimates of the diversity indicators, two detritivore genus (earthworms and Hymenoptera) were the ones with the greatest presence, being important in the production of the banana agrosystem due to the decomposition of organic matter and its nutritional contribution to the plant. We observed a direct correlation with earthworms and an indirect relationship with Hymenoptera.

                Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the leading health challenges worldwide that influences the provision of quality patient care. Stigma and discrimination around this condition and the health care needs affect the health care provision. This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of theatre nurses’ experiences in providing perioperative to patients living with HIV at a tertiary hospital in South Africa. Methods: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Tshwane district, South Africa. The study was underpinned by an interpretative phenomenological analysis design. Data were collected from 10 criterion purposively selected theatre nurses using in-depth individual interviews. Data were thematically analyzed and guided by an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework for data analysis. Results: The study revealed that theatre nurses work in an under-resourced environment. The resources highlighted are human, materials, including personal protective equipment and life support. The situation negatively affects the perioperative care of HIV-positive patients, who are always prone to perioperative complications, such as profuse bleeding, and even death. The situation increases the occupational risk to the nurses. Conclusions: The researchers proposed several recommendations targeted at improving the resources needed by theatre nurses when caring for people living with HIV perioperatively at South African tertiary hospitals. Findings will add to the body of knowledge of the Nursing profession about offering perioperative care to persons living with HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Frontline War: A Case-control study of risk factors for COVID-19 among health care workers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected several people worldwide. World Health Organization(WHO) has reported that an alarming number of health care workers (HCWs) have been affected and have also succumbed to this disease. Though health infrastructure can be boosted in a short period, the number of HCWs cannot. Hence understanding the risk factors that the HCWs are exposed to and strategically protecting them is of paramount importance. Methods: A case-control retrospective study was carried out on 116 HCWs at a tertiary care hospital treating COVID-19 patients in South India. We attempted to investigate and stratify the specific risk factors for COVID-19 transmission among HCWs. Data was collected regarding their exposure to COVID-19 patients, infection control precautions used, possible breaches in the protocol, and details of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis. Results: The demographics were equally distributed among the cases and controls. Exposure to surgical procedures on suspected/positive COVID patients was also found to affect contracting the COVID-19 illness. HCWs who wore face shields instead of eye goggles along with the use of scrubs and hospital gowns were found to have a lesser incidence of COVID-19 illness. Conclusion: This study helped us understand the varied risk factors that health care workers are exposed to while treating COVID-19 patients. It helped us contextualize and strategize our infection control practices to prevent further morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dosing time optimization of antihypertensive medications by including the circadian rhythm in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Javiera Cortés-Ríos, Ramón C. Hermida, Maria Rodriguez-Fernandez</p>

Blood pressure (BP) follows a circadian variation, increasing during active hours, showing a small postprandial valley and a deeper decrease during sleep. Nighttime reduction of 10–20% relative to daytime BP is defined as a dipper pattern, and a reduction of less than 10%, as a non-dipper pattern. Despite this BP variability, hypertension’s diagnostic criteria and therapeutic objectives are usually based on BP average values. Indeed, studies have shown that chrono-pharmacological optimization significantly reduces long-term cardiovascular risk if a BP dipper pattern is maintained. Changes in the effect of antihypertensive medications can be explained by circadian variations in their pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Nevertheless, BP circadian variation has been scarcely included in PK-PD models of antihypertensive medications to date. In this work, we developed PK-PD models that include circadian rhythm to find the optimal dosing time (<i>Ta</i>) of first-line antihypertensive medications for dipper and non-dipper patterns. The parameters of the PK-PD models were estimated using global optimization, and models were selected according to the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion value. Simultaneously, sensitivity and identifiability analysis were performed to determine the relevance of the parameters and establish those that can be estimated. Subsequently, <i>Ta</i> parameters were optimized to maximize the effect on BP average, BP peaks, and sleep-time dip. As a result, all selected models included at least one circadian PK component, and circadian parameters had the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, <i>Ta</i> with which BP>130/80 mmHg and a dip of 10–20% are achieved were proposed when possible. We show that the optimal <i>Ta</i> depends on the therapeutic objective, the medication, and the BP profile. Therefore, our results suggest making chrono-pharmacological recommendations in a personalized way.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Statistical perspective on functional and causal neural connectomics: The Time-Aware PC algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rahul Biswas, Eli Shlizerman</p>

The representation of the flow of information between neurons in the brain based on their activity is termed the <i>causal functional connectome</i>. Such representation incorporates the dynamic nature of neuronal activity and causal interactions between them. In contrast to connectome, the causal functional connectome is not directly observed and needs to be inferred from neural time series. A popular statistical framework for inferring causal connectivity from observations is the <i>directed probabilistic graphical modeling</i>. Its common formulation is not suitable for neural time series since it was developed for variables with independent and identically distributed static samples. In this work, we propose to model and estimate the causal functional connectivity from neural time series using a novel approach that adapts directed probabilistic graphical modeling to the time series scenario. In particular, we develop the <i>Time-Aware PC</i> (TPC) algorithm for estimating the causal functional connectivity, which adapts the PC algorithm—a state-of-the-art method for statistical causal inference. We show that the model outcome of TPC has the properties of reflecting causality of neural interactions such as being non-parametric, exhibits the <i>directed Markov</i> property in a time-series setting, and is predictive of the consequence of counterfactual interventions on the time series. We demonstrate the utility of the methodology to obtain the causal functional connectome for several datasets including simulations, benchmark datasets, and recent multi-array electro-physiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SyBLaRS: A web service for laying out, rendering and mining biological maps in SBGN, SBML and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hasan Balci, Ugur Dogrusoz, Yusuf Ziya Ozgul, Perman Atayev</p>

Visualization is a key recurring requirement for effective analysis of relational data. Biology is no exception. It is imperative to annotate and render biological models in standard, widely accepted formats. Finding graph-theoretical properties of pathways as well as identifying certain paths or subgraphs of interest in a pathway are also essential for effective analysis of pathway data. Given the size of available biological pathway data nowadays, automatic layout is crucial in understanding the graphical representations of such data. Even though there are many available software tools that support graphical display of biological pathways in various formats, there is none available as a service for on-demand or batch processing of biological pathways for automatic layout, customized rendering and mining paths or subgraphs of interest. In addition, there are many tools with fine rendering capabilities lacking decent automatic layout support.
To fill this void, we developed a web service named SyBLaRS (Systems Biology Layout and Rendering Service) for automatic layout of biological data in various standard formats as well as construction of customized images in both raster image and scalable vector formats of these maps. Some of the supported standards are more generic such as GraphML and JSON, whereas others are specialized to biology such as SBGNML (The Systems Biology Graphical Notation Markup Language) and SBML (The Systems Biology Markup Language). In addition, SyBLaRS supports calculation and highlighting of a number of well-known graph-theoretical properties as well as some novel graph algorithms turning a specified set of objects of interest to a minimal pathway of interest.
We demonstrate that SyBLaRS can be used both as an offline layout and rendering service to construct customized and annotated pictures of pathway models and as an online service to provide layout and rendering capabilities for systems biology software tools.
SyBLaRS is open source and publicly available on GitHub and freely distributed under the MIT license. In addition, a sample deployment is available here for public consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive multi-objective control explains how humans make lateral maneuvers while walking</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David M. Desmet, Joseph P. Cusumano, Jonathan B. Dingwell</p>

To successfully traverse their environment, humans often perform maneuvers to achieve desired task goals while simultaneously maintaining balance. Humans accomplish these tasks primarily by modulating their foot placements. As humans are more unstable laterally, we must better understand how humans modulate lateral foot placement. We previously developed a theoretical framework and corresponding computational models to describe how humans regulate lateral stepping during straight-ahead continuous walking. We identified goal functions for step width and lateral body position that define the walking task and determine the set of all possible task solutions as Goal Equivalent Manifolds (GEMs). Here, we used this framework to determine if humans can regulate lateral stepping during <i>non</i>-steady-state lateral maneuvers by minimizing errors consistent with these goal functions. Twenty young healthy adults each performed four lateral lane-change maneuvers in a virtual reality environment. Extending our general lateral stepping regulation framework, we first re-examined the requirements of such transient walking tasks. Doing so yielded new theoretical predictions regarding how steps during any such maneuver should be regulated to minimize error costs, consistent with the goals required at each step and with how these costs are adapted at each step during the maneuver. Humans performed the experimental lateral maneuvers in a manner consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, their stepping behavior was well modeled by allowing the parameters of our previous lateral stepping models to adapt from step to step. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate humans might use evolving cost landscapes in real time to perform such an adaptive motor task and, furthermore, that such adaptation can occur quickly–over only one step. Thus, the predictive capabilities of our general stepping regulation framework extend to a much greater range of walking tasks beyond just normal, straight-ahead walking.

                Background: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are more error-resistant than other forward error-correcting codes. Existing circuits give high power dissipation, less speed, and more occupying area. This work aimed to propose a better design and performance circuit, even in the presence of noise in the channel. Methods: In this research, the design of the multiplexer and demultiplexer were achieved using pass transistor logic. The target parameters were low power dissipation, improved throughput, and more negligible delay with a minimum area. One of the essential connecting circuits in a decoShder architecture is a multiplexer (MUX) and a demultiplexer (DEMUX) circuit. The design of the MUX and DEMUX contributes significantly to the performance of the decoder. The aim of this paper was the design of a 4 × 1 MUX to route the data bits received from the bit update blocks to the parallel adder circuits and a 1 × 4 DEMUX to receive the input bits from the parallel adder and distribute the output to the bit update blocks in a layered architecture LDPC decoder. The design uses pass transistor logic and achieves the reduction of the number of transistors used. The proposed circuit was designed using the Mentor Graphics CAD tool for 180 nm technology. Results: The parameters of power dissipation, area, and delay were considered crucial parameters for a low power decoder. The circuits were simulated using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the results depicted a significantly low power dissipation of 7.06 nW and 5.16 nW for the multiplexer and demultiplexer, respectively. The delay was found to be 100.5 ns (MUX) and 80 ns (DEMUX). Conclusion: This decoder’s potential use may be in low-power communication circuits such as handheld devices and Internet of Things (IoT) circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Plasma metabolites link dietary patterns to stroke risk</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>While dietary intake is linked to stroke risk, surrogate markers that could inform personalized dietary interventions are lacking. We identified metabolites associated with diet patterns and incident stroke in a nested cohort from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of 162 metabolites were measured in baseline plasma from stroke cases (n=1,198) and random controls (n=904). We examined associations between metabolites and a plant-based diet pattern previously linked to reduced stroke risk in REGARDS. Secondary analyses included three additional stroke-associated diet patterns: a Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Southern diet. Metabolites were tested using Cox proportional hazards models with incident stroke as the outcome. Replication was performed in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Inverse odds ratio-weighted mediation was used to determine whether metabolites mediated the association between a plant-based diet and stroke risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Metabolites associated with a plant-based diet included the gut metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (β=0.23, 95% CI [0.14, 0.33], p=1.14x10<sup>-6</sup>), guanosine (β=-0.13, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.07], p=6.48x10<sup>-5</sup>), gluconic acid (β=-0.11, 95% CI [-0.18, -0.04], p=2.06x10<sup>-3</sup>), and C7 carnitine (β=-0.16, 95% CI [-0.24, -0.09], p=4.14x10<sup>-5</sup>). All of these metabolites were associated with both additional diet patterns and altered stroke risk. Mediation analyses identified guanosine (32.6% mediation, p=1.51x10<sup>-3</sup>), gluconic acid (35.7%, p=2.28x10<sup>-3</sup>), and C7 carnitine (26.2%, p=1.88x10<sup>-2</sup>) as mediators linking a plant-based diet to reduced stroke risk.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A subset of diet-related metabolites are associated with risk of stroke. These metabolites could serve as surrogate markers that inform dietary interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Environmental enrichment and social isolation modulate inhibitory transmission and plasticity in hippocampal area CA2</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental factors are well-accepted to play a complex and interdependent role with genetic factors in learning and memory. The goal of this study was to examine how environmental conditions altered synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area CA2. To do this, we housed adult mice for 3 weeks in an enriched environment (EE) consisting of a larger cage with running wheel, and regularly changed toys, tunnels and treats. We then performed whole-cell or extracellular field recordings in hippocampal area CA2 and compared the synaptic plasticity from EE-housed mice with slices from littermate controls housed in standard environment (SE). We found that the inhibitory transmission recruited by CA3 input stimulation in CA2 was significantly less plastic in EE conditions as compared to SE following an electrical tetanus. We demonstrate that delta-opioid receptor (DOR) mediated plasticity is reduced in EE conditions by direct application of DOR agonist. We show that in EE conditions the overall levels of GABA transmission is reduced in CA2 cells by analyzing inhibition of ErbB4 receptor, spontaneous inhibitory currents and paired-pulse ratio. Furthermore, we report that the effect of EE of synaptic plasticity can be rapidly reversed by social isolation. These results demonstrate how the neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are sensitive to environment and may lead to promising therapeutic targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A subpopulation of spikes predicts successful epilepsy surgery outcome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epileptic spikes are the traditional interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker for epilepsy. Given their low specificity for identifying the epileptogenic zone (EZ), they are attributed only moderate attention in presurgical evaluation. This study aims to demonstrate that it is possible to identify specific spike features in intracranial EEG that optimally define the EZ and predict surgical outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed spike features on stereo-EEG segments from 83 operated patients from two epilepsy centers (37 Engel IA) in wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. After automated spike detection, we investigated 135 spike features based on rate, morphology, propagation, and energy to determine the best feature or feature combination to discriminate the EZ in seizure-free and non-seizure-free patients by applying 4-fold cross-validation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The rate of spikes with preceding gamma activity in wakefulness performed better for surgical outcome classification (4-fold area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC): 0.755±0.07) than the seizure-onset zone, the current gold standard (AUC:0.563±0.05, <i>p</i>=0.015) and the ripple rate, an emerging seizure-independent biomarker (AUC:0.537±0.07, <i>p</i>=0.006). Channels with a spike-gamma rate exceeding 1.9/minute had an 80% probability of being in the EZ. Combining features did not improve the results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Resection of brain regions with high spike-gamma rates in wakefulness is associated with a high probability of achieving seizure freedom. This rate could be applied to determine the minimal number of spiking channels requiring resection. In addition to quantitative analysis, this feature is easily accessible to visual analysis, which could aid clinicians during presurgical evaluation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Atrial Fibrillation Risk Assessment after Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Around 20% of strokes are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause. Yet, oral anticoagulation in unselected ESUS patients failed in secondary stroke prevention. Guidance on effective AF-detection is lacking. Here, we introduce a novel, non-invasive AF-risk assessment after ESUS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Catch-Up ESUS is an investigator-initiated, observational cohort study conducted between 2018-2019 at the Munich University Hospital. Besides clinical characteristics, patients received ≥72h digital electrocardiogram recordings to generate the rhythm irregularity burden. Uni- and multivariable regression models predicted the primary endpoint of incident AF, ascertained by standardized follow-up including implantable cardiac monitors. Predictors included the novel rhythm irregularity burden constructed from digital electrocardiogram recordings. We independently validated our model in ESUS patients from the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>297 ESUS patients were followed for 15.6±7.6 months. Incident AF (46 patients, 15.4%) occurred after a median of 105 [25<sup>th</sup>; 75<sup>th</sup> percentile 31;338] days. Secondary outcomes were recurrent stroke in 7.7% and death in 6.1%. Multivariable-adjusted analyses identified the rhythm irregularity burden as the strongest AF-predictor (hazard ratio 3.12; 95% confidence interval 1.62-5.80; p&lt;0001) while accounting for the known risk factors age, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-Score, and NT-proBNP. Independent validation confirmed the rhythm irregularity burden as the most significant AF-predictor (hazard ratio 2.20; 95% confidence interval 1.45-3.33; p&lt;0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The novel, non-invasive, ECG-based rhythm irregularity burden may help adjudicating AF-risk after ESUS and subsequently guide AF-detection after ESUS. Clinical trials need to clarify if high AF-risk patients benefit from tailored secondary stroke prevention.</p>

                <p>Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-antibody-associated-disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n=15[79%]), seizures (n=13[68%]) and encephalopathy (n=12[63%]) were frequent. MRI revealed unilateral (n=12[63%]) or bilateral (n=7[37%]) cortical T2-hyperintensity and leptomeningeal-enhancement (n=17[89%]). NMDA-receptor autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n=2) showed extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n=2), microglial reactivity (n=2) and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, 1; meningeal, 1). Most received high-dose steroids (n=17[90%]) and all improved but 3 had CCE relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its pathogenesis.</p>

                Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share genetic risks as well as clinical manifestations. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether, and how, common neurobiological pathways translate their shared polygenic risks into shared clinical manifestations. We present the miR-124-AMPAR pathway as a key neurobiological pathway that connects their shared polygenic risks with behavioral changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Nse5/6-like SIMC1-SLF2 complex localizes SMC5/6 to viral replication centers</a></h4>

              
                The human SMC5/6 complex is a conserved guardian of genome stability and an emerging component of antiviral responses. These disparate functions likely require distinct mechanisms of SMC5/6 regulation. In yeast, Smc5/6 is regulated by its Nse5/6 subunits, but such regulatory subunits for human SMC5/6 are poorly defined. Here, we identify a novel SMC5/6 subunit called SIMC1 that contains SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) and an Nse5-like domain. We isolated SIMC1 from the proteomic environment of SMC5/6 within polyomavirus large T antigen (LT)-induced subnuclear compartments. SIMC1 uses its SIMs and Nse5-like domain to localize SMC5/6 to polyomavirus replication centers (PyVRCs) at SUMO-rich PML nuclear bodies. SIMC1's Nse5-like domain binds to the putative Nse6 orthologue SLF2 to form an anti-parallel helical dimer resembling the yeast Nse5/6 structure. SIMC1-SLF2 structure-based mutagenesis defines a conserved surface region containing the N-terminus of SIMC1's helical domain that regulates SMC5/6 localization to PyVRCs. Furthermore, SLF1, which recruits SMC5/6 to DNA lesions via its BRCT and ARD motifs, binds SLF2 analogously to SIMC1 and forms a separate Nse5/6-like complex. Thus, two Nse5/6-like complexes with distinct recruitment domains control human SMC5/6 localization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast rule switching and slow rule updating in a perceptual categorization task</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to a changing world, we must be able to switch between rules already learned and, at other times, learn rules anew. Often we must do both at the same time, switching between known rules while also constantly re-estimating them. Here, we show these two processes, rule switching and rule learning, rely on distinct but intertwined computations, namely fast inference and slower incremental learning. To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (<i>rule switching</i>) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (<i>rule learning</i>). Our results shed light on the computational interactions between rule switching and rule learning, and make testable neural predictions for these interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Acetylation of a fungal effector that translocates host PR1 facilitates virulence</a></h4>

              
                Pathogens utilize a panoply of effectors to manipulate plant defense. However, despite their importance, relatively little is actually known about regulation of these virulence factors. Here, we show that the effector FolSvp1, secreted from fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (<i>Fol</i>) directly binds and translocates the tomato pathogenesis-related protein1, SlPR1, from the apoplast outside the plasma membrane to the host nucleus via its nuclear localization signal. Relocation of SlPR1 abolishes generation of the defense signaling peptide, CAPE1, from its C-terminus, and as a consequence, facilitates pathogen invasion of plants. The action of FolSvp1 requires covalent modification by acetylation for full virulence in host tomato tissues. The modification is catalyzed by the <i>Fol</i> FolArd1 lysine acetyltransferase prior to secretion. Addition of an acetyl group to one residue, K167, prevents ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in both <i>Fol</i> and plant cells with different mechanisms, allowing it to function normally in fungal invasion. Either inactivation of FolSvp1 or removal of the acetyl group on K167 leads to impaired pathogenicity of <i>Fol</i>. These findings indicate that acetylation can regulate the stability of effectors of fungal plant pathogens with impact on virulence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular basis of the PIP2-dependent regulation of CaV2.2 channel and its modulation by CaV β subunits</a></h4>

              
                High-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels that adjust Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon membrane depolarization are differentially regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in an auxiliary Ca<sub>V</sub> β subunit-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism by which the β subunits control the PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels remains unclear. By engineering various α1B and β constructs in tsA-201 cells, we reported that at least two PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites, including the polybasic residues at the C-terminal end of I–II loop and the binding pocket in S4<sub>II</sub> domain, exist in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. Moreover, they were distinctly engaged in the regulation of channel gating depending on the coupled Ca<sub>V</sub> β2 subunits. The membrane-anchored β subunit abolished the PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction of the phospholipid-binding site in the I–II loop, leading to lower PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. By contrast, PIP<sub>2</sub> interacted with the basic residues in the S4<sub>II</sub> domain of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels regardless of β2 isotype. Our data demonstrated that the anchoring properties of Ca<sub>V</sub> β2 subunits to the plasma membrane determine the biophysical states of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels by regulating PIP<sub>2</sub> coupling to the nonspecific phospholipid-binding site in the I–II loop.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-configuring feedback loops for sensorimotor control</a></h4>

              
                How dynamic interactions between nervous system regions in mammals performs online motor control remains an unsolved problem. In this paper we show that feedback control is a simple, yet powerful way to understand the neural dynamics of sensorimotor control. We make our case using a minimal model comprising spinal cord, sensory and motor cortex, coupled by long connections that are plastic. It succeeds in learning how to perform reaching movements of a planar arm with 6 muscles in several directions from scratch. The model satisfies biological plausibility constraints, like neural implementation, transmission delays, local synaptic learning and continuous online learning. Using differential Hebbian plasticity the model can go from motor babbling to reaching arbitrary targets in less than 10 minutes of in silico time. Moreover, independently of the learning mechanism, properly configured feedback control has many emergent properties: neural populations in motor cortex show directional tuning and oscillatory dynamics, the spinal cord creates convergent force fields that add linearly, and movements are ataxic (as in a motor system without a cerebellum).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural and functional insights of the human peroxisomal ABC transporter ALDP</a></h4>

              
                Adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) is responsible for the transport of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and corresponding CoA-esters across the peroxisomal membrane. Dysfunction of ALDP leads to peroxisomal metabolic disorder exemplified by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Hundreds of ALD-causing mutations have been identified on ALDP. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are restricted to clinical description due to limited structural and biochemical characterization. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ALDP with nominal resolution at 3.4 Å. ALDP exhibits a cytosolic-facing conformation. Compared to other lipid ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ALDP has two substrate binding cavities formed by the transmembrane domains (TMD). Such structural organization may be suitable for the coordination of VLCFAs. Based on the structure, we performed integrative analysis of the cellular trafficking, protein thermostability, ATP hydrolysis and the transport activity of representative mutations. These results provide a framework for understanding the working mechanism of ALDP and pathogenic roles of disease-associated mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the GOLD-domain seven-transmembrane helix protein family member TMEM87A</a></h4>

              
                TMEM87s are eukaryotic transmembrane proteins with two members (TMEM87A and TMEM87B) in humans. TMEM87s have proposed roles in protein transport to and from the Golgi, as mechanosensitive ion channels, and in developmental signaling. TMEM87 disruption has been implicated in cancers and developmental disorders. To better understand TMEM87 structure and function, we determined a cryo-EM structure of human TMEM87A in lipid nanodiscs. TMEM87A consists of a Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain atop a membrane spanning seven-transmembrane helix domain with a large cavity open to solution and the membrane outer leaflet. Structural and functional analyses suggest TMEM87A may not function as an ion channel or G-protein coupled receptor. We find TMEM87A shares its characteristic domain arrangement with seven other proteins in humans; three that had been identified as evolutionary related (TMEM87B, GPR107, and GPR108) and four previously unrecognized homologs (GPR180, TMEM145, TMEM181, and WLS)). Among these structurally related GOLD domain seven-transmembrane helix (GOST) proteins, WLS is best characterized as a membrane trafficking and secretion chaperone for lipidated Wnt signaling proteins. We find key structural determinants for WLS function are conserved in TMEM87A. We propose TMEM87A and structurally homologous GOST proteins could serve a common role in trafficking membrane-associated cargo.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sublytic gasdermin-D pores captured in atomistic molecular simulations</a></h4>

              
                Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) is the ultimate effector of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with pathogen invasion and inflammation. After proteolytic cleavage by caspases, the GSDMD N-terminal domain (GSDMD<sup>NT</sup>) assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and induces the formation of membrane pores. We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> monomers, oligomers, and rings in an asymmetric plasma membrane mimetic. We identify distinct interaction motifs of GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylserine (PS) headgroups and describe their conformational dependence. Oligomers are stabilized by shared lipid binding sites between neighboring monomers acting akin to double-sided tape. We show that already small GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> oligomers support stable, water-filled and ion-conducting membrane pores bounded by curled beta-sheets. In large-scale simulations, we resolve the process of pore formation from GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> arcs and lipid efflux from partial rings. We find that high-order GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> oligomers can crack under the line tension of 86 pN created by an open membrane edge to form the slit pores or closed GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> rings seen in experiment. Our simulations provide a detailed view of key steps in GSDMD<sup>NT</sup>-induced plasma membrane pore formation, including sublytic pores that explain nonselective ion flux during early pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brown adipocytes local response to thyroid hormone is required for adaptive thermogenesis in adult male mice</a></h4>

              
                Thyroid hormone (T3) and its nuclear receptors (TR) are important regulators of energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis, notably through their action in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, T3 acts in many other peripheral and central tissues which are also involved in energy expenditure. The general picture of how T3 regulates BAT thermogenesis is currently not fully established, notably due to the absence of extensive omics analyses and the lack of specific mice model. Here, we first used transcriptome and cistrome analyses to establish the list of T3/TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes. We then developed a novel model of transgenic mice, in which T3 signaling is specifically suppressed in brown adipocytes at adult stage. We addressed the capacity of these mice to mount a thermogenic response when challenged by either a cold exposure or a high-fat diet, and analyzed the associated changes in BAT transcriptome. We conclude that T3 plays a crucial role in the thermogenic response of the BAT, controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and regulating BAT proliferation. The resulting picture provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure through an efficient adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-throughput imaging and quantitative analysis uncovers the nature of plasmid positioning by ParABS</a></h4>

              
                The faithful segregation and inheritance of bacterial chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids requires dedicated partitioning systems. The most common of these, ParABS, consists of ParA, a DNA-binding ATPase and ParB, a protein that binds to centromeric-like <i>parS</i> sequences on the DNA cargo. The resulting nucleoprotein complexes are believed to move up a self-generated gradient of nucleoid-associated ParA. However, it remains unclear how this leads to the observed cargo positioning and dynamics. In particular, the evaluation of models of plasmid positioning has been hindered by the lack of quantitative measurements of plasmid dynamics. Here, we use high-throughput imaging, analysis and modelling to determine the dynamical nature of these systems. We find that F plasmid is actively brought to specific subcellular home positions within the cell with dynamics akin to an over-damped spring. We develop a unified stochastic model that quantitatively explains this behaviour and predicts that cells with the lowest plasmid concentration transition to oscillatory dynamics. We confirm this prediction for F plasmid as well as a distantly-related ParABS system. Our results indicate that ParABS regularly positions plasmids across the nucleoid but operates just below the threshold of an oscillatory instability, which according to our model, minimises ATP consumption. Our work also clarifies how various plasmid dynamics are achievable in a single unified stochastic model. Overall, this work uncovers the dynamical nature of plasmid positioning by ParABS and provides insights relevant for chromosome-based systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulatory imbalance between LRRK2 kinase, PPM1H phosphatase, and ARF6 GTPase disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing phosphorylation of RAB GTPases through hyperactive kinase activity. We found that LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs disrupt the axonal transport of autophagosomes by perturbing the coordinated regulation of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors. In iPSC-derived human neurons, knock-in of the strongly-hyperactive LRRK2-p.R1441H mutation caused striking impairments in autophagosome transport, inducing frequent directional reversals and pauses. Knock-out of the opposing Protein Phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) phenocopied the effect of hyperactive LRRK2. Overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a GTPase that acts as a switch for selective activation of dynein or kinesin, attenuated transport defects in both p.R1441H knock-in and PPM1H knock-out neurons. Together, these findings support a model where a regulatory imbalance between LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs and ARF6 induces an unproductive "tug-of-war" between dynein and kinesin, disrupting processive autophagosome transport. This disruption may contribute to PD pathogenesis by impairing the essential homeostatic functions of axonal autophagy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic age acceleration predicts subject-specific white matter degeneration in the human brain.</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic clocks provide powerful tools for estimating health and lifespan but their ability to predict brain degeneration and neuronal damage during the aging process is unknown. In this study, we use GrimAge, an epigenetic clock correlated to several blood plasma proteins, to longitudinally investigate brain cellular microstructure in axonal white matter from a cohort of healthy aging individuals. Given the blood plasma correlations used to develop GrimAge, a specific focus was made on white matter hyperintensities, a visible neurological manifestation of small vessel disease, and the axonal pathways throughout each individual's brain affected by their unique white matter hyperintensity location and volume. 98 subjects over 55 years of age were scanned at baseline with 41 returning for a follow-up scan 2 years later. Using diffusion MRI lesionometry, we reconstructed subject-specific networks of affected axonal tracts and examined the diffusion cellular microstructure composition of these areas, both at baseline and longitudinally, for evidence of cellular degeneration. A chronological age adjusted version of GrimAge was significantly correlated with baseline WMH volume and markers of neuronal decline, indicated by increased extracellular free water, increased intracellular signal, and decreased axonal signal within WMH. By isolating subject-specific axonal regions 'lesioned' by crossing through a WMH, age-adjusted GrimAge was also able to predict longitudinal development of similar patterns of neuronal decline throughout the brain. This study is the first to establish a relationship between accelerated epigenetic GrimAge and brain cellular microstructure in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rate of neuronal turnover in the healthy adult murine myenteric ganglia varies with ganglia size</a></h4>

              
                Major gastrointestinal and systemic functions are regulated by the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), whose cells are organized in interconnected clusters or ganglia to form plexuses in the gut wall. Previously, we showed that neuronal turnover, driven by overall equal rates of neurogenesis and neuronal loss, is an important homeostatic mechanism that maintains the larger myenteric plexus of the healthy adult ENS. While this process maintains neuronal numbers, whether it occurs at the same rate across the two sexes, in different regions and within ganglia that contain a diversity of neuronal numbers remains unknown. Here, by using antibodies against the DNA replication marker phospho-Histone H3 and against the pan-neuronal marker Hu to detect new-born neurons, we observe that while the proportions of new-born myenteric neurons are conserved irrespective of the region or sex in the healthy small intestine, they are inversely correlated with ganglia size. In contrast, by using antibodies against the apoptosis marker Cleaved Caspase 3 and Hu, we found that proportions of apoptotic neurons were directly correlated with ganglia size. Our observations on the unequal rate of neuronal turnover across ganglia, where smaller ganglia are more neurogenic and larger ganglia are more apoptotic, suggests that the myenteric ganglia are plastic in nature. These results provide further insight into the dynamic nature of the adult ENS.

                Hippocampal network activity at theta frequencies (5-10Hz) is important for behavior. However, it remains unclear how behaviorally-relevant network theta rhythms arise and interact with cellular dynamics to dictate spike timing. We performed membrane voltage (Vm) imaging of individual CA1 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons with simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings in mice during locomotion. We found that Vm theta rhythms organize spike timing in both cell types regardless of behavioral conditions, but the Vm of parvalbumin interneurons is better synchronized with LFP. The temporal relationships between spikes and LFP theta reliably reflect the Vm-LFP relationships in parvalbumin cells, but not in pyramidal cells. Thus, cellular theta rhythms broadly organize spike timing in CA1 neurons, and parvalbumin interneurons are critical in coordinating network theta rhythms.

                Transcranial focused ultrasound has the potential to noninvasively and systematically modulate deep brain circuits and impart sustained, neuroplastic effects in awake subjects. The intersection of these key properties is critical for effective treatments of brain disorders, yet remains to be shown. Harnessing the full potential of transcranial ultrasound, we delivered 30-second stimuli to deep brain targets (left/right lateral geniculate nucleus) in non-human primates while they performed a visual discrimination task. This brief sonication induced a sustained bias in choice behavior that persisted up to 15 minutes following the ultrasound offset. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an increase in gamma activity with dynamics that matched the effects on behavior. Moreover, the ultrasound was delivered into the targets daily for a period of more than 6 months. There were no detrimental effects on the animals' discrimination accuracy over the course of this stimulation regimen, even though the stimuli exceeded the FDA 510(k) Track 3 intensity values. This study highlights ultrasound's capacity to modify deep brain activity in a safe and therapeutically relevant way in awake subjects, thus bringing the approach closer to therapeutic options for patients suffering from treatment-resistant disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Online decoding of covert speech based on the passive perception of speech</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can offer solutions to communicative impairments induced by conditions such as locked-in syndrome. While covert speech-based BCIs have garnered interest, a major issue facing their clinical translation is the collection of sufficient volumes of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) examples of covert speech signals which can typically induce fatigue in users. Fortuitously, investigations into the linkage between covert speech and speech perception have revealed spatiotemporal similarities suggestive of shared encoding mechanisms. Here, we sought to demonstrate that an electroencephalographic cross-condition machine learning model of speech perception and covert speech can successfully decode neural speech patterns during online BCI scenarios. Methods: In the current study, ten participants underwent a dyadic protocol whereby participants perceived the audio of a randomly chosen word and then subsequently mentally rehearsed it. Eight words were used during the offline sessions and subsequently narrowed down to three classes for the online session (two words, rest). The modelling was achieved by estimating a functional mapping derived from speech perception and covert speech signals of the same speech token (features were extracted via a Riemannian approach). Results: While most covert speech BCIs deal with binary and offline classifications, we report an average ternary and online BCI accuracy of 75.3% (60% chance-level), reaching up to 93% in select participants. Moreover, we found that perception-covert modelling effectively enhanced the SNR of covert speech signals correlatively to their high-frequency correspondences. Conclusions: These findings may pave the way to efficient and more user-friendly data collection for passively training such BCIs. Future iterations of this BCI can lead to a combination of audiobooks and unsupervised learning to train a non-trivial vocabulary that can support proto-naturalistic communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience drives the development of novel, reliable cortical sensory representations from endogenously structured networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits embody remarkably reliable neural representations of sensory stimuli that are critical for perception and action. The fundamental structure of these network representations is thought to arise early in development prior to the onset of sensory experience. However, how these endogenously generated networks respond to the onset of sensory experience, and the extent to which they reorganize with experience remains unclear. Here we examine this 'nature-nurture transform' using chronic in vivo calcium imaging to probe the developmental emergence of the representation of orientation in visual cortex of the ferret, a species with a well-defined modular network of orientation-selective responses. At eye opening, visual stimulation of endogenous networks evokes robust modular patterns of cortical activity. However, these initial evoked activity patterns are strikingly different from those in experienced animals, exhibiting a high degree of variability both within and across trials that severely limits stimulus discriminability. In addition, visual experience is accompanied by a number of changes in the structure of the early evoked modular patterns including a reduction in dimensionality and a shift in the leading pattern dimensions indicating significant network reorganization. Moreover, these early evoked patterns and their changes are only loosely constrained by the endogenous network structure of spontaneous activity, and spontaneous activity itself reorganizes considerably to align with the novel evoked patterns. Based on a computational network model, we propose that the initial evoked activity patterns reflect novel visual input that is only poorly aligned with the endogenous networks and that highly reliable visual representations emerge from a realignment of feedforward and recurrent networks that is optimal for these novel patterns of visually driven activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic degeneration and altered synaptic innervation of a central auditory neuron during age-related hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Cellular morphology and synaptic configuration are key determinants of neuronal function and are often modified under pathological conditions. In the first nucleus of the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus (CN), principal bushy neurons specialize in processing temporal information of sound critical for hearing. These neurons alter their physiological properties during aging that contribute to age-related hearing loss (ARHL). The structural basis of such changes remains unclear, especially age-related modifications in their dendritic morphology and the innervating auditory nerve (AN) synapses. Using young (2-5 months) and aged (28-33 months) CBA/CaJ mice of either sex, we filled individual bushy neurons with fluorescent dye in acute brain slices to characterize their dendritic morphology, followed by immunostaining against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and calretinin (CR) to identify innervating AN synapses. We found that the dendritic morphology of aged bushy neurons had significantly reduced complexity, suggesting age-dependent dendritic degeneration, especially in neurons with predominantly non-CR-expressing synapses on the soma. These dendrites were innervated by AN bouton synapses, which were predominantly non-CR-expressing in young mice but had an increased proportion of CR-expressing synapses in old mice. While somatic AN synapses degenerated substantially with age, as quantified by VGluT1-labeled puncta volume, no significant difference was observed in the total volume of dendritic synapses between young and old mice. Consequently, synaptic density on dendrites was significantly higher in old mice. The findings suggest that dendritic degeneration and altered synaptic innervation in bushy neurons during aging may underlie their changed physiological activity and contribute to the development of ARHL.

                Alcohol use disorders are complex conditions characterized in part by excessive ethanol (EtOH) drinking and withdrawal-induced malaise. The corticotropin releasing factor-1 receptor (CRF1) has been implicated in EtOH drinking, affective states, and pain sensitivity; often in a sex-dependent manner. The studies presented here investigate the associations between baseline behavior, chronic intermittent EtOH intake, and withdrawal-induced affective behavior in male and female CRF1:cre: tdTomato rats. There were no sex differences in basal affective state or thermal sensitivity, as measured by the splash test, novelty suppressed feeding test, and Hargreaves, respectively. However, female rats displayed increased mechanical sensitivity, measured by the Von Frey test. Following baseline testing, rats underwent voluntary EtOH or water drinking under intermittent access conditions. Female rats consumed significantly more EtOH, but only during the first week. There were no group effects of EtOH on behavioral tests, but all of the rats demonstrated increased malaise upon repeated testing. There were significant individual differences where affective behavior positively correlated with negative affect in both sexes. There were also significant correlations between EtOH intake and CRF1-cFos co-expression in the infralimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala. EtOH decreased CRF1+ expression in the lateral amygdala, but there were no significant group effects of EtOH on cFos or CRF1-cFos co-expression in the medial prefrontal cortex or amygdala. Together, these results illustrate the complex interplay between affect, pain sensitivity, EtOH drinking, and the role of CRF1 containing neurons in mediating these behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Forgetting Dynamics For Items of Different Categories</a></h4>

              
                How the dynamic evolution of forgetting changes for different materials is unexplored. By using a common experimental paradigm with stimuli of different types, we were able to directly cross-examine the emerging dynamics and we found that even though the presentation sets differ minimally by design, the obtained curves appear to fall on a discrete spectrum. Furthermore, we have previously proposed a model of forgetting based on the notion of retrograde interference with a single integer parameter. All measured curves were compatible with the model with different values of the parameter, hinting to a potential common underlying mechanism of forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical reactivations predict future sensory responses</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing theories of offline memory consolidation posit that the pattern of neurons activated during a salient sensory experience will be faithfully reactivated, thereby stabilizing the entire pattern. However, sensory-evoked patterns are not stable, but instead drift across repeated experiences. To investigate potential roles of reactivations in the stabilization and/or drift of sensory representations, we imaged calcium activity of thousands of excitatory neurons in mouse lateral visual cortex. Presentation of a stimulus resulted in transient, stimulus-specific reactivations during the following minute. These reactivations depended on local circuit activity, as they were abolished by local silencing during the preceding stimulus. Contrary to prevailing theories, reactivations systemically differed from previous patterns evoked by the stimulus. Instead, they were more similar to future patterns evoked by the stimulus, thereby predicting representational drift. In particular, neurons that participated more or less in early reactivations than in stimulus response patterns subsequently increased or decreased their future stimulus responses, respectively. The rate and content of these reactivations was sufficient to accurately predict future changes in stimulus responses and, surprisingly, the decreasing similarity of responses to distinct stimuli. Thus, activity patterns during sensory cortical reactivations may guide the drift in sensory responses to improve sensory discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene perception and visuospatial memory converge at the anterior edge of visually-responsive cortex</a></h4>

              
                To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brain's functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface, while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality (VR) and fMRI. Using VR, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single field-of-view to a city street. We used fine-grained individual subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Exp. 1) and recognition (Exp. 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex scaled with the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally-defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that scaled with the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An MR-based brain template and atlas for optical projection tomography and light sheet fluorescence microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) are high resolution optical imaging techniques operating in the mm-cm range, ideally suited for ex vivo 3D whole mouse brain imaging. Although these techniques exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for antibody labeled targets, the provided anatomical information remains limited. To allow anatomical mapping of fluorescent signal in whole brain, we developed a novel magnetic resonance (MR) based template with its associated tissue priors and atlas labels, specifically designed for brains subjected to tissue processing protocols required for 3D optical imaging. We investigated the effect of tissue preprocessing and clearing on brain size and morphology and developed optimized templates for BABB/Murrays clear (OCUM) and DBE/iDISCO (iOCUM) cleared brains. By creating optical (i)OCUM fusion images using our mapping procedure, we localized dopamine transporter and translocator protein expression and tracer innervation from the eye to the lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus and superior colliculus. These fusion images allowed for precise anatomical identification of fluorescent signal in discrete brain areas. As such, these templates enable applications in a broad range of research areas integrating optical 3D brain imaging by providing an MR template for cleared brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ketone ester-enriched diet ameliorates motor and dopamine release deficits in MitoPark mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction and dopamine deficits. The MitoPark mouse recapitulates several facets of Parkinson's disease, including gradual development of motor deficits, which enables the study of potential therapeutic interventions. One therapeutic strategy involves decreasing the mitochondrial metabolic load by inducing ketosis and providing an alternative energy source for neurons, leading to decreased neuronal oxidative stress. Objective: We assessed whether administration of a ketone ester-enriched diet would improve motor and dopamine release deficits in MitoPark mice. Methods: Motor function (rotarod and open field tests), dopamine release (fast-scan cyclic voltammetry), tissue dopamine levels (GC-MS), and dopamine neurons and axons (immunofluorescence) were assessed in MitoPark and control mice fed either the standard or ketone ester-enriched diets. Results: When started on the ketone diet before motor dysfunction onset, MitoPark mice had preserved motor function relative to standard diet MitoPark mice. While the ketone ester enriched diet did not preserve dopamine neurons or striatal dopamine axons, dopamine release in ketone diet MitoPark mice was greater than standard diet MitoPark mice but less than control mice. In a follow up experiment, we began the ketone diet after motor dysfunction onset and observed a modest preservation of motor function in ketone diet MitoPark mice relative to standard diet MitoPark mice. Conclusion: The improvement in motor dysfunction indicates that a ketone ester enriched diet or ketone supplement may represent a promising adjunct treatment for Parkinson's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel Hypothesis for Migraine Disease Mechanism: The Creation of a New Attractor Responsible for Migraine Disease Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                Migraine Disease (MD) is one of the primary headaches in which the pathophysiological mechanism is yet unknown. It is still unclear how the ictal phases' periods are determined? Why can any small trigger sometimes initiate the ictal phase, and sometimes, even bigger triggers cannot? Considering the brain as a dynamic system and proposing a complex system model for that as a migraineur or a healthy subject is a viable method. Here, the interaction between whole neurons is analyzed rather than individual neurons. This model is a complex system with a chaotic attractor. With parameter alternations, this attractor changes from one scroll to double scroll, representing a healthy or a migraineur brain. In the proposed system, the attractor's borders are the regions where every small trigger can start the ictal phase, while the outer areas are the non-sensitive brain situations. We believe that MD and Chua's systems have certain behavioral similarities. This study aimed to explain the function of MD and offer a theory that adequately describes its behavior. Finally, it has been tried to discuss some physiological evidences such as Migraine Generator Network (MGN), Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD), and the role of Serotonin and other substances in relation to the expressed hypotheses. This insight may propose newer methods for preventing or curing MD. Knowing the functioning of dynamic systems and finding similar behaviors with MD on the one hand, as well as linking physiological and pathophysiological evidence with a quantitative model can be very useful in better understanding, managing, and controlling the MD.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder linked to numerous rare, inherited and arising de novo genetic variants. ASD often co-occurs with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy, which are associated with hyperexcitability of neurons. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability in ASD remain poorly understood. Transient receptor potential canonical-6 (TRPC6) is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and is a candidate risk gene for ASD. Using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cortical neurons, single cell calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recording, we show that TRPC6 knockout (KO) reduces SOCE signaling and leads to hyperexcitability of neurons by increasing action potential frequency and network burst frequency. Our data provide evidence that reduction of SOCE by TRPC6 KO results in neuronal hyperexcitability, which we hypothesize is an important contributor to the cellular pathophysiology underlying hyperactivity in some ASD.

                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a primary dose-limiting side effect caused by antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. This causes damage to peripheral nerves and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Currently, there are no effective treatments for CIPN, which can lead to long-term morbidity in cancer patients and survivors. Neuro-immune interactions occur in CIPN and have been implicated both in the development and progression of the disease and disease resolution. We investigated the potential role of Inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS) in the resolution of CIPN pain-like behaviors in mice. ICOS is an immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation of T cells. We found that intrathecal administration of ICOS agonist antibody (ICOSaa) alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity caused by paclitaxel and facilitates the resolution of mechanical sensitivity in female mice. Administration of ICOSaa reduced astrocyte-gliosis in the spinal cord and satellite cell gliosis in the DRG of mice previously treated with paclitaxel. Mechanistically, ICOSaa intrathecal treatment promoted pain resolution by increasing interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression in the dorsal root ganglion. In line with these observations, blocking IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) activity occluded the effects of ICOSaa treatment on CIPN behavior in female mice. Suggesting a broader activity in neuropathic pain, ICOSaa also partially resolved mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Our findings support a model wherein ICOSaa administration induces IL-10 expression to facilitate neuropathic pain relief in female mice. ICOSaa treatment is in clinical development for solid tumors and given our observation of T cells in the human DRG, ICOSaa therapy could be developed for combination chemotherapy - CIPN clinical trials.

                Despite the enormous harms of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), many mechanisms, as well as effective prevention or treatment strategies remain elusive. Genetic factors dictate a majority of AUD risk. These risk factors can manifest as reduced naive sensitivity to alcohol's intoxicating effects and increased functional tolerance, i.e., brain-mediated decreases in sensitivity upon repeat exposure. The underlying neurobiology of how AUD-associated genes alter these endophenotypes remains poorly understood. Genes implicated in AUDs include epigenetic modifiers, such as histone demethylases, including Kdm3. We previously showed that whole-body and neuronal Kdm3 strongly affect ethanol sensitivity and tolerance in Drosophila. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of these effects, and, by extension, mechanisms of sensitivity and tolerance. RNA-seq and pathway analysis on Kdm3KO flies revealed disproportionate upregulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, including 1-carbon pathways. We show that acute amino acid feeding modulates sensitivity and tolerance in a Kdm3-dependent manner. Global manipulation of 1-carbon genes, especially glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), glycine decarboxylase (Gldc), and sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh), alters alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. These changes in alcohol responses are likely mediated by global glycine levels (a substrate of these enzymes) rather than by 1-carbon input. Conversely, neuronal manipulations of 1-carbon pathways change alcohol sensitivity and tolerance in a pattern that suggests a mechanism through S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a 1-carbon metabolite that is the universal methyl donor required for epigenetic methylation. Increasing SAM production specifically in glutamatergic neurons increases sensitivity and tolerance. Together, these findings reveal distinct mechanisms affecting alcohol sensitivity and tolerance globally (via glycine) and neuronally (via SAM), thus revealing an important and complex role of 1-carbon metabolism in mediating AUD phenotypes.

                Even after successful extinction, conditioned fear can return. Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In this preregistered direct replication study, we confirm that spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predict extinction memory retrieval 24 h later. We do not confirm that L-DOPA administration after extinction enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels, an indicator of arousal, at extinction onset. Further, pre-extinction sAA negatively predicts retrieval and (at trend) vmPFC reactivations, and these impeding effects are abolished by L-DOPA treatment. Our results suggest that L-DOPA may enhance extinction consolidation under high-arousal conditions, as typically present during exposure therapy sessions.

                Current research tools for pre-clinical drug development such as rodent models and 2D immortalised monocultures have failed to serve as effective translational models for human CNS disorders. Recent advancements in the development of iPSCs and 3D culturing can improve the in vivo-relevance of pre-clinical models, while generating 3D cultures though novel bioprinting technologies can offer increased scalability and replicability. As such, there is a need to develop platforms that combine iPSC-derived cells with 3D bioprinting to produce scalable, tunable and biomimetic cultures for preclinical drug discovery applications. We report a biocompatible PEG-based matrix which incorporates RGD and YIGSR peptide motifs and full length collagen IV at a stiffness similar to the human brain (1.5 kPa). Using a high-throughput commercial bioprinter we report the viable culture and morphological development of iPSC-derived astrocytes, brain microvascular endothelial cells, neural progenitors and neurons in our novel matrix. We also show that this system supports endothelial vasculogenesis and enhances neural differentiation and spontaneous activity. This platform forms a foundation for more complex, multicellular models to facilitate high-throughput translational drug discovery for CNS disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking lexical and semantic prediction error underlying the N400 using artificial neural network models of sentence processing</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has shown that the internal dynamics of an artificial neural network model of sentence comprehension displayed a similar pattern to the amplitude of the N400 in several conditions known to modulate this event-related potential. These results led Rabovsky, Hansen, and McClelland (2018) to suggest that the N400 might reflect change in an implicit predictive representation of meaning corresponding to semantic prediction error. This explanation stands as an alternative to the hypothesis that the N400 reflects lexical-prediction error as estimated by word Surprisal (Frank, Otten, Galli, & Vigliocco, 2015). In the present study, we directly model the amplitude of the N400 elicited during naturalistic sentence processing by using as predictor the update of the distributed representation of sentence meaning generated by a Sentence Gestalt model (McClelland, St. John, & Taraban, 1989) trained on a large-scale text corpus. This enables a quantitative prediction of N400 amplitudes based on a cognitively motivated model, as well as quantitative comparison of this model to alternative models of the N400. Specifically, we compare the update measure from the SG model to Surprisal estimated by a comparable language model trained on next-word prediction. The results reported in this paper corroborate the hypothesis that N400 amplitudes correspond to the change in an implicit predictive representation of meaning after every word presentation. Furthermore, we argue that a comparison of the Sentence Gestalt update and Surprisal might also uncover two distinct but probably closely related sub-processes that contribute to the processing of a sentence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellar-driven cortical dynamics enable task acquisition, switching and consolidation</a></h4>

              
                During task execution cortical dynamics must bridge sensory cues with future behavioural outcomes. However, how cortical networks acquire such task-specific dynamics remains unclear. Here we propose that the cerebellum drives cortical dynamics to enable rapid and flexible task acquisition. We model cerebellar networks that are tuned through timing rules to provide cortical networks with task-outcome predictions. First, using sensorimotor tasks we show that cerebellar feedback with fixed cortical connectivity is sufficient for rapid task acquisition and one-shot task switching. Next, we demonstrate that, when trained in working memory tasks, the cerebellum can also underlie the maintenance of cognitive-specific dynamics, explaining a range of optogenetic and behavioural observations. Finally, we use our model to introduce a systems consolidation theory in which task information is gradually transferred from the cerebellum to the cortex. In summary, our results suggest that cortico-cerebellar loops are critical for task acquisition, switching and consolidation in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hand preference and the corpus callosum: Is there really no association?</a></h4>

              
                Originating from a series of morphometric studies conducted in the 1980s, it appears a widely held belief in cognitive neuroscience that the corpus callosum is larger in non-right handers than in right handers (RH). However, a recent meta-analysis challenges this belief by not finding significant differences in corpus callosum size between handedness groups. Yet, relying on the available published data, the meta-analysis was not able to account for a series of factors potential influencing its outcome, such as confounding effects of brain size differences and a restricted spatial resolution of previous callosal segmentation strategies. To address these remaining questions, we here analysed the midsagittal corpus callosum of N = 1057 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Young Adults) to compare handedness groups based on consistency (e.g., consistent RH vs. mixed handers, MH) and direction of hand preference (e.g., RH vs. left handers). A possible relevance of brain-size differences was addressed by analysing callosal variability by both using forebrain volume (FBV) as covariate and utilising relative area (callosal area/thickness divided by FBV) as dependent variable. Callosal thickness was analysed at 100 measuring points along the structure to achieve high spatial resolution to detect subregional effects. However, neither of the conducted analyses was able to find significant handedness-related differences in callosal and the respective effect-sizes estimates were small. For example, comparing MH and consistent RH, the effect sizes for difference in callosal area were below a Cohen's d = 0.1 (irrespective of how FBV was included), and narrow confidence intervals allowed to exclude effects above |d| = 0.2. Analysing thickness, effect sizes were below d = 0.2 with confidence intervals not extending above |d| = 0.3. In this, the possible range of population effect sizes of hand preference on callosal morphology appears well below the effects commonly reported for factors like age, sex, or brain size. Effects on cognition or behaviour accordingly can be considered small, questioning the common practice to attribute performance differences between handedness groups to differences in callosal architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Firing rate adaptation in continuous attractor neural networks accounts for theta phase shift of hippocampal place cells</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells of freely moving animals display 'theta phase precession', whereby spikes are fired at successively earlier phases of the 6-10 Hz local field potential (LFP) theta rhythm. In some cases, this phase precession is interleaved with periods of 'phase procession', in which spikes are fired at successively later phases of the theta rhythm. Here we propose a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) with firing rate adaptation to understand both kinds of phase shift in place cell firing. We show that firing rate adaptation induces intrinsic mobility of the location represented by the 'bump' of population activity, which competes with the extrinsic mobility arising from external sensory inputs. The interplay between these two factors causes the activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling the forward and backward sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. Analysis of single cell dynamics reveals that these forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. Furthermore, by tuning the adaptation strength, we explain the difference between bimodal and unimodal cells, with the former having interleaved phase precession and procession, and the latter having only the predominant phase precession. Our model reproduces other experimental findings, including the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells' firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. Our results show how the intrinsic dynamics of a population of place cells affords both types of theta phase shift. We hope that they will aid an understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

                Flexible decision making in complex environments is a hallmark of intelligent behavior but the underlying learning mechanisms and neural computations remain elusive. Through a combination of behavioral, computational and electrophysiological analysis of a novel multidimensional rule-learning paradigm, we show that both rats and humans sequentially probe different behavioral strategies to infer the task rule, rather than learning all possible mappings between environmental cues and actions as current theoretical formulations suppose. This species-conserved process reduces task dimensionality and explains both observed sudden behavioral transitions and positive transfer effects. Behavioral strategies are represented by rat prefrontal activity and strategy-related variables can be decoded from magnetoencephalography signals in human prefrontal cortex. These mechanistic findings provide a foundation for the translational investigation of impaired cognitive flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circuit-specific selective vulnerability in the DMN persists in the face of widespread amyloid burden.</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between brainwide functional decline and accumulation of pathological protein aggregates in Alzheimer disease (AD) is complex and not well understood. A set of highly interconnected cortical regions known as the default mode network (DMN) exhibits selective vulnerability to both functional decline and amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques in early AD. One possibility is that early A{beta} accumulation in the DMN drives vulnerability. However, it is unknown whether there is something intrinsic to neuronal projections within the DMN that biases these circuits towards dysfunction. Here we directly test this hypothesis using long-term recordings of the spiking activity of ensembles of single units in freely behaving mice characterized by global cortical and hippocampal A{beta} burden (APP/PS1). Specifically, we track the interactions of a population of neurons within a DMN region and two additional populations that comprise monosynaptic targets, one within and the other outside the DMN. In addition, we record single neurons in hippocampus and examine interactions between in-DMN and out-DMN cortical circuits triggered on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, stereotyped hippocampal events that contribute to memory consolidation in the cortex. We examine the statistics of local activity as well as inter-regional communication in a region, genotype, and brain-state dependent manner. Our data reveal dysfunction restricted to in-DMN projecting circuits. In contrast, communication along neuronal projections that originate in the DMN but target out-DMN populations are equivalent in APP/PS1 and WT mice. Circuit dysfunction is most evident throughout sleep as well as within sharp-wave ripples. Our results indicate that cells in the DMN exhibit differential intrinsic vulnerability to amyloid injury dependent on their projection targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The GLM-Spectrum: A multilevel framework for spectrum analysis with covariate and confound modelling</a></h4>

              
                Spectrum estimators that make use of averaging across time segments are ubiquitous across neuroscience. The core of this approach has not changed substantially since the 1960s, though many advances in the field of regression modelling and statistics have been made during this time. Here, we propose a new approach, the General Linear Model (GLM) Spectrum, which reframes time averaged spectral estimation as multiple regression. This brings several benefits, including the ability to do confound modelling, hierarchical modelling and significance testing via non-parametric statistics. We apply the approach to a first-level EEG resting-state dataset alternating between eyes open and eyes closed resting-state. The GLM-Spectrum can model both conditions, quantify their differences, and perform denoising through confound regression in a single step. This application is scaled up from a single channel to a whole-head recording and, finally, applied to quantify age differences across a large group-level dataset. We show that the GLM-Spectrum lends itself to rigorous modelling of within- and between-subject contrasts as well as their interactions, and that the use of model-projected spectra provides an intuitive visualisation. The GLM-Spectrum is a flexible framework for robust multi-level analysis of power spectra, with adaptive covariance and confound modelling.

                Despite the advances in ischemic stroke treatment, not all patients are eligible for or fully recovered after recanalization therapies. Therapeutic hypothermia could be adjuvant therapy that optimizes the beneficial effect of reperfusion. While conventional whole-body cooling has severe adverse effects, selective brain cooling has emerged as an attractive alternative. However, clinical application is limited by the lack of optimal delivery methods and unknown treatment parameters. Optimal parameters may depend on injury levels and monitoring cerebral perfusion may provide valuable information. Here, we show that selective brain cooling via our in-house developed Vortex tube IntraNasal Cooling Instrument (VINCI), even with a clinically relevant delay in treatment, can attenuate subacute injuries in animals with severe ischemic stroke. The treatment responses of selective brain cooling were characterized by CT Perfusion (CTP). The predicted lesion volume by CTP matched the true infarct volume by histology when the brain temperature was decreased by 5 oC from normothermia. More importantly, we found that global hyperemia (high cerebral blood flow) before rewarming could be an early manifestation of poor treatment outcomes. Altogether, our study shows that VINCI-enabled brain cooling could be guided by CTP imaging as adjuvant therapy for severe ischemic stroke. This work lays the groundwork toward individualized selective brain cooling.

                Neuroimaging studies have allowed for non-invasive mapping of brain networks in brain tumors. Although tumor core and oedema are easily identifiable using standard MRI acquisitions, imaging studies often neglect signals and structures and functions within their presence. Therefore, both functional and diffusion signals, as well as their relationship with global patterns of connectivity reorganization, are poorly understood. Here, we explore functional activity and the structure of white matter fibers considering the contribution of the whole tumor in a surgical context. First, we find that intra-tumor signals do exist and are correlated with alterations present both in healthy tissue and resting-state networks. Second, we propose a fiber tracking pipeline capable of using anatomical information while still reconstructing bundles in tumoral and peritumoral tissue. Finally, using machine learning and healthy anatomical information, we predict structural rearrangement after surgery given the preoperative brain network. The generative model also disentangles complex patters of connectivity reorganization for different types of tumors. Overall, we show the importance of carefully designing studies including MR signals within damaged brain tissues, as they exhibit and relate to non-trivial patterns of both structural and functional (dis-)connections or activity.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that involves early and significant neuropathological changes within the entorhinal cortex (EC). Many have reported on neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction in the brains of AD patients and AD models. In parallel, abnormalities of neuropeptides (NPs) that play important roles in modulating neuronal activities are commonly observed in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the involvement of NPs has mostly been studied in the context of neurons; a cell type-specific examination of NP expression in AD brains is needed. Here, we aim to examine the NP networks in the EC of AD brains using single-nuclei and bulk transcriptomic data from other regions in the temporal cortex, focusing on the gene expression of NP and their cognate G-protein coupled receptors. We find that NP genes were expressed by all major cell types in the brain and there was a significant decrease in the quantity and the proportion of cells that express NPs in AD EC cells. On the contrary, the overall expression of GPCR genes showed an increase in AD cells, likely reflecting ongoing compensatory mechanisms in AD brains. In addition, we report that there was a disproportionate absence of cells expressing higher levels and greater diversity of NPs in AD brains. Finally, we established a negative correlation between age and the abundance of AD-associated NPs in the hippocampus, supporting that the disruption of the NP signaling network in the EC may contribute to the early pathogenesis of AD. In short, we report widespread disruption of the NP networks in AD brains at the single-cell level. In light of our results, we hypothesize that brain cells, especially neurons, that express high levels of NPs may exhibit selective vulnerability to AD. Moreover, it is likely AD brains undergo specific adaptive changes to fluctuating NP signaling, a process that can likely be targeted with therapeutic approaches aimed at stabilizing NP expression landscapes. Given that GPCRs are one of the most druggable targets for neurological diseases and disorders, we believe NP signaling pathways can be harnessed for future biomarkers and treatment strategies for AD.

	<p>We report two patients, one with and one without long-term persistent tiling inside an arcuate macular scotoma. In both cases, the scotoma was caused by a cilioretinal artery occlusion. Both patients were almost identical regarding the location and extent of the scotoma. In both cases, there was a comparable degree of atrophy on optical coherence tomography for the retinal nerve fibre, ganglion cell, and inner plexiform layers. The main difference was the preservation of the inner nuclear layer in the patient with persistent tiling. In this patient, optical coherence angiography demonstrates preserved perfusion of the superior vascular plexus, which was not the case in the patient with the negative scotoma who also had atrophy of the inner nuclear layer. Recreational use of cannabinoid enhanced the intensity of perceived tiling in the relative scotoma of the first patient. A review of the literature suggests that the persistent tiling described in our case is different to teichopsias of retinal or cerebral origin. These data suggest that persistent monocular tiling in a scotoma arises from retinal circuit activity that requires the preservation of the inner nuclear layer. Future research should investigate this functional&amp;amp;ndash;structural relationship in other diseases, including glaucoma.</p>

	<p>Background: Both the global COVID-19 pandemic situation, as well as the current political situation in Eastern Europe may exacerbate anxiety and contribute to stress-related disorders such as panic disorder. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback provides both assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s brainwave activity as well as the possibility of its therapeutic correction. It is possible that it can be implemented as an auxiliary treatment in panic disorders of different origin. The aim of this feasibility study was to demonstrate (both short- and long-term) effectiveness of neurofeedback therapy in a patient with previously diagnosed panic attacks, related to fear of COVID-19 infection. Methods: We report the case study of a 47-year-old man affected by panic attacks, related to his profound, constant fear of COVID-19 infection and its sequelae. For the initial diagnostic workup, several clinical and research tools were used: 1. Baseline psychological exam; 2. Anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;targeted interview performed by miniQEEG therapist; 3. Analysis of previous clinical test results (EEG record/lab blood test); and 4. The miniQEEG exam (central strip recording Cz-C3-C4), The patient was subjected to regular EEG Neurofeedback sessions for two consecutive months. After completing the treatment, follow-up tests, as listed above were repeated immediately after completing the whole treatment program, as well as 1 and 2 years later. MiniQEEG results were compared with healthy control (age-matched male subject not affected with panic attacks) and evaluated over the time that the subject was involved in the study. Results: Initially, the patient was suffering from severe panic attacks accompanied by vegetative symptoms and from destructive and negative thoughts. After 8 consecutive weeks of treatment encompassing sixteen QEEG neurofeedback training sessions (each lasting 30 min), a subjective improvement of his complaints was reported. More importantly, QEEG records of the patient also improved, approximating the pattern of QEEG recorded in the healthy control. Conclusion: In this single case-based feasibility analysis, we demonstrate that systematic application of QEEG-Neurofeedback may result in manifest and durable therapeutic effect. Of note, use of this treatment may be a valuable option for patients with panic attack/panic disorder, especially if related to the psychological burden of the COVID-19/war era. Future studies on a larger patient population, especially with a longitudinal/prospective design, are warranted.</p>

	<p>Thyroid hormone (TH) augmentation, although commonly used for major depression, is sparingly used for bipolar disorder (BD) after the failure of mood-stabilizing agents. While the exact mechanisms of thyroid hormone action in BD remains unclear, central thyroid hormone deficit has been postulated as a mechanism for rapid cycling. This systematic review&amp;amp;mdash;conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines&amp;amp;mdash;of eight studies synthesizes the evidence for TH augmentation in BD. A systematic search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCT), open-label trials, and observational studies of levothyroxine (LT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) for BD. Open-label studies of high dose LT4 augmentation for bipolar depression and rapid cycling showed improvement in depression outcomes and reduction in recurrence, respectively. However, an RCT of high-dose LT4 did not show benefit in contrast to placebo. An RCT comparing LT4, T3, and placebo showed benefit only in rapid-cycling bipolar women. A meta-analysis could not be completed due to significant differences in study designs, interventions, and outcomes. Our systematic review shows mixed evidence and a lack of high-quality studies. The initial promise of supratherapeutic LT4 augmentation from open-label trials has not been consistently replicated in RCTs. Limited data are available for T3. The studies did not report thyrotoxicosis, and TH augmentation were well tolerated. Therefore, TH augmentation, especially with supratherapeutic doses, should be reserved for highly treatment-resistant bipolar depression and rapid-cycling BD.</p>

	<p>Background: cocaine craving is a core feature of cocaine use disorder and remains a critical challenge for abstinence and relapse prevention. This review summarizes the anti-craving efficacy of pharmacotherapies tested for cocaine use disorder, in the context of randomized-controlled clinical trials. Objectives: we assessed the databases of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO, without date restrictions up to August 2022, to identify relevant studies. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: we included double-blinded randomized-controlled trials investigating pharmacotherapies for cocaine craving and/or cocaine use disorder whose outcomes included cocaine craving. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two authors screened studies&amp;amp;rsquo; titles and abstracts for inclusion, and both read all the included studies. We systematically gathered information on the following aspects of each study: title; author(s); year of publication; sample size; mean age; sample characteristics; study set-ting; whether participants were treatment-seeking; study design; craving measures; study interventions; drop-out rates; and other relevant outcomes. Results: Overall, we appraised 130 clinical trials, including 8137 participants. We further considered the drugs from the studies that scored equal to or greater than six points in the quality assessment. There was a correlation between craving and cocaine use outcomes (self-reports, timeline follow-back or urinary benzoylecgonine) in the vast majority of studies. In the short-term treatment, acute phenylalanine-tyrosine depletion, clonidine, fenfluramine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and mecamylamine presented promising effects. In the long term, amphetamine, biperiden, carbamazepine, lisdexamfetamine, lorcaserin, methamphetamine, mirtazapine, pioglitazone, progesterone, guanfacine, levodopa, nefazodone presented promising anti-craving effects. Unfortunately, the highly tested medications were not successful in most of the trials, as follows: propranolol in the short term; amantadine, aripiprazole, bromocriptine, citicoline, ketamine, modafinil, olanzapine, topiramate in the long term. The remaining 52 medications had no positive anti-craving outcomes. Limitations: Our review was limited by high heterogeneity of craving assessments across the studies and by a great range of pharmacotherapies. Further, the majority of the studies considered abstinence and retention in treatment as the main outcomes, whereas craving was a secondary outcome and some of the studies evaluated patients with cocaine use disorder with comorbidities such as opioid or alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity. Lastly, most of the studies also included non-pharmacological treatments, such as counseling or psychotherapy Conclusions: There is a direct association between craving and cocaine use, underscoring craving as an important treatment target for promoting abstinence among persons with cocaine use disorder. Clonidine, fenfluramine and m-CPP showed to be promising medications for cocaine craving in the short-term treatment, and amphetamine, biperiden, carbamazepine, lisdexamfetamine, lorcaserin, methamphetamine, mirtazapine, pioglitazone, progesterone, guanfacine, levodopa, nefazodone in the long-term treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: Intelligence scores in males with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) remain a major issue in clinical practice. We performed a literature review and meta-analysis to further delineate the intellectual functioning of dystrophinopathies. Method: Published, peer-reviewed articles assessing intelligence, using Wechsler Scales, of males with DMD or BMD were searched from 1960 to 2022. Meta-analysis with random-effects models was conducted, assessing weighted, mean effect sizes of full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores relative to normative data (Mean = 100, Standard Deviation = 15). Post hoc we analysed differences between performance and verbal intelligence scores. Results: 43 studies were included, reporting data on 1472 males with dystrophinopathies; with FSIQ scores available for 1234 DMD (k = 32) and 101 BMD (k = 7). DMD males score, on average, one standard deviation below average (FSIQ = 84.76) and significantly lower than BMD (FSIQ = 92.11). Compared to a previous meta-analysis published in 2001, we find, on average, significantly higher FSIQ scores in DMD. Conclusion: Males with Duchenne have, on average, significantly lower FSIQ scores than BMD males and the general population. Clinicians must consider lower intelligence in dystrophinopathies to ensure good clinical practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal contact predicts connectivity in the C. elegans brain</a></h4>

              
                Axons must project to particular brain regions, contact adjacent neurons, and choose appropriate synaptic targets to form a nervous system. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain synaptic partnership choice. In a 'lock-and-key' mechanism, first proposed by Sperry's chemoaffinity model, a neuron selectively chooses a synaptic partner among several different, adjacent target cells, based on a specific molecular recognition code. Alternatively, Peters' rule posits that neurons indiscriminately form connections with other neuron types in their proximity; hence, neighborhood choice, dictated by initial neuronal process outgrowth and position, is the sole predictor of connectivity. However, whether Peters' rule plays an important role in synaptic wiring remains unresolved. To assess the nanoscale relationship between neuronal adjacency and connectivity, we evaluate the expansive set of C. elegans connectomes. We find that synaptic connectivity can be accurately modeled as a path-length-dependent process of neuronal adjacency and brain strata, offering strong support for Peters' rule as an organizational principle of C. elegans brain wiring.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When your border and my border differ: Spatial regionalisation and route choice depends on perceived landmark categorization</a></h4>

              
                Humans spontaneously structure spatial environments into a hierarchy of regions. Besides connectivity and boundaries, sensory or functional similarities of landmarks have been shown to influence construction of regions. In natural spaces, regions and places are usually named and these names provide additional cues for the cognitive construction of regions. In this study we investigate the role of semantic similarities of place names in the formation of regions in a virtual environment with homogeneous connectivity. Place names were selected and distributed in a way that two alternative semantic categorizations were possible which corresponded to two equally valid regionalisations of the same environment. Region perception was assessed by having subjects choose between two equidistant routes crossing different numbers of region boundaries (classification consistent route choice). In a priming phase, subjects were biased to sort the landmark names in one or the other categorization scheme. In the test phase, subjects preferably selected routes with a lower number of region crossings according to the categorization previously discovered. The results show that perceived semantic similarity of place names does affect route choice and the formation of spatial regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct Cortical Inputs to Hippocampal Area CA1 Transmit Complementary Signals for Goal-directed Navigation</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) is central to the brain's navigation system. Its subregions are conventionally thought to compute dichotomous representations for spatial processing: medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provides a global spatial map, while lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) encodes specific sensory details of experience. While local recordings of EC circuits have amassed a vast catalogue of specialized cell types that could support navigation computations in the brain, we have little direct evidence for how these signals are actually transmitted outside of the EC to its primary downstream reader, the hippocampus, which itself is critical for the formation of spatial and episodic memories. Here we exploit in vivo sub-cellular imaging to directly record from EC axon terminals as they locally innervate hippocampal area CA1, while mice performed navigational and spatial learning tasks in virtual reality. We find both distinct and overlapping representations of task, location, and context in both MEC and LEC axons. While MEC transmitted a highly location- and context-specific code, LEC inputs were strongly biased by ongoing navigational goals and reward. Surprisingly, the position of the animal could be accurately decoded from either entorhinal subregion. Our results challenge prevailing dogma on the routing of spatial and non-spatial information from the cortex to the hippocampus, indicating that cortical interactions upstream of the hippocampus are critical for combining these processing streams to support navigation and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The variegation of human brain vulnerability to rare genetic disorders and convergence with behaviorally defined disorders</a></h4>

              
                Diverse gene dosage disorders (GDDs) increase risk for psychiatric impairment, but characterization of GDD effects on the human brain has so far been piecemeal and lacked simultaneous analysis of multiple brain features across different GDDs. Here, through multimodal neuroimaging of 3 aneuploidy syndromes (XXY, XYY, trisomy 21), we reveal considerable diversity in cortical changes across GDDs and imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs). This variegation of IDP change underlines the limitations of studying GDD effects unimodally. Integration across all IDP maps reveals highly distinct architectures of cortical change in each GDD, along with partial coalescence onto a common spatial axis of cortical vulnerability. This common axis shows strong alignment with shared cortical changes in behaviorally defined psychiatric disorders, and is enriched for specific molecular and cellular signatures - offering a high-priority target for future translational research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recombinant protein delivery enables modulation of the phototransduction cascade in mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Retinal dystrophies of genetic origin are often associated with mutations in the genes involved in the phototransduction cascade in photoreceptors, a paradigmatic signaling pathway mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Photoreceptor viability is strictly dependent on the levels of the second messengers cGMP and Ca2+. Here we explored the possibility of modulating the phototransduction cascade in mouse rods using direct or liposome-mediated administration of a recombinant protein crucial for regulating the interplay of the second messengers in photoreceptor outer segments. The effects of administration of the free and liposome-encapsulated human guanylate cyclase-activating protein (GCAP1) were compared in biological systems of increasing complexity (in cyto, ex vivo, and in vivo). Analysis of protein biodistribution and direct measurement of functional alteration in rod photoresponses show that the exogenous GCAP1 protein is fully incorporated into the mouse retina and photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, only in the presence of a point mutation associated with cone-rod dystrophy in humans p.(E111V), protein delivery induces a disease-like electrophysiological phenotype, consistent with constitutive activation of the retinal guanylate cyclase. Our study demonstrates that both direct and liposome-mediated protein delivery are powerful tools for targeting signaling cascades in neuronal cells, which could be particularly important for the treatment of autosomal dominant genetic diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Motor Plans Using a Closed-Loop Ultrasonic Brain-Machine Interface</a></h4>

              
                Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be transformative for people living with chronic paralysis. BMIs translate brain signals into computer commands, bypassing neurological impairments and enabling people with neurological injury or disease to control computers, robots, and more with nothing but thought. State-of-the-art BMIs have already made this future a reality in limited clinical trials. However, high performance BMIs currently require highly invasive electrodes in the brain. Device degradation limits longevity to about 5 years. Their field of view is small, restricting the number, and type, of applications possible. The next generation of BMI technology should include being longer lasting, less invasive, and scalable to sense activity from large regions of the brain. Functional ultrasound neuroimaging is a recently developed technique that meets these criteria. In this present study, we demonstrate the first online, closed-loop ultrasonic brain-machine interface. We used 2 Hz real-time functional ultrasound to measure the neurovascular activity of the posterior parietal cortex in two nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed memory-guided movements. We streamed neural signals into a classifier to predict the intended movement direction. These predictions controlled a behavioral task in real-time while the NHP did not produce overt movements. Both NHPs quickly succeeded in controlling up to eight independent directions using the BMI. Furthermore, we present a simple method to "pretrain" the BMI using data from previous sessions. This enables the BMI to work immediately from the start of a session without acquiring extensive additional training data. This work establishes, for the first time, the feasibility of an ultrasonic BMI and prepares for future work on a next generation of minimally invasive BMIs that can restore function to patients with neurological, physical, or even psychiatric impairments.

                The patch-clamp technique has revolutionized neurophysiology by allowing to study single neuronal excitability, synaptic connectivity, morphology, and the transcriptomic profile. However, the throughput in recordings is limited because of the manual replacement of patch-pipettes after each attempt often also being unsuccessful. This has been overcome by automated cleaning the tips in detergent solutions, allowing to reuse the pipette for further recordings. Here, we developed a novel method of automated cleaning by sonicating the tips within the bath solution wherein the cells are placed, reducing the risk of contaminating the bath solution or internal solution of the recording pipette by any detergent and avoiding the necessity of a separate chamber for cleaning. We showed that the patch-pipettes can be used consecutively at least 10 times and that the cleaning process does not negatively impact neither the brain slices nor other patched neurons. This method, combined with automated patch-clamp, highly improves the throughput for single and especially multiple recordings.

                We utilized positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in vivo to map the spatiotemporal biodistribution/expression (protein density) of class-IIa histone deacetylases (class-IIa HDACs) in the brain. Herein, we report an improved radiosynthesis of [18F]-NT160 using 4-hydroxy-TEMPO which led to a significant improvement in radiochemical yield and molar activity. PET imaging with [18F]-NT160, a highly potent class-IIa HDAC inhibitor with sub-nM affinity for HDAC4 and 5 isoforms, led to high-quality and high-contrast images among various brain regions. [18F]-NT160 displayed excellent pharmacokinetic and imaging characteristics: brain uptake is high in gray matter regions, leading to high-quality PET images; tissue kinetics are appropriate for an 18F tracer and specific binding for class-IIa HDACs is demonstrated by self-blockade. Higher uptake with [18F]-NT160 was observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex while there was relatively lower uptake in the cerebellum and striatum. Overall, our current studies with [18F]-NT160 will likely facilitate the development and clinical translation of class-IIa HDACs of the next generation of PET tracers for imaging and targeted therapy of cancer and the diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).

                With the recent surge of single cell RNA sequencing datasets (scRNAseq) the extent of cellular heterogeneity has become apparent, yet it remains poorly characterized on a protein level in brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived brain models. With this in mind, we developed a high-throughput, standardized approach for the reproducible characterization of cell types in complex neuronal tissues. We designed a flow cytometry (FC) antibody panel coupled with a computational pipeline to quantify cellular subtypes in human iPSC derived midbrain organoids. Our pipeline, termed CelltypeR, contains scripts to transform and align multiple datasets, optimize unsupervised clustering, annotate cell types, quantify cell types, and compare cells across conditions. We identified the expected brain cell types, then sorted neurons, astrocytes, and radial glia, confirming these cell types with scRNAseq. We present an adaptable analysis framework providing a generalizable method to reproducibly identify cell types across FC datasets.

                Abnormal intracellular accumulation of Tau aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which can be caused by mutations of Tau. Mutated and pathological Tau can undergo a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that might trigger or modulate disease pathology. Recent studies indicate that modification of wild type Tau by Small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO isoform 1 (SUMO1) controls Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, suggesting that SUMOylation acts as a central regulator of Tau's biochemical properties. Besides SUMO1, Tau is modified by SUMO2/3, however the consequences of this modification have not been investigated. Here, using viral approaches on primary hippocampal neurons, transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau and SUMO2, and iPSC-derived neurons from FTD patients, we evaluated whether SUMO2/3 conjugation modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregation-prone mutant Tau P301L, P301S, and R406W variants. We found that mutant forms of Tau are targets of SUMO2/3, and SUMO2/3 conjugation is neuroprotective. Importantly, expression of mutant Tau is accompanied by a significant reduction of SUMO2/3 conjugation levels, and restoring levels of SUMO2 reduces mutant Tau aggregation and phosphorylation in all model systems Furthermore, overexpression of SUMO2 restores levels of pre- and post-synaptic markers, associated with a complete rescue of the LTP and memory deficits in transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau. These findings bring to light the potential therapeutic implication of manipulating SUMO conjugation to detoxify Tau through PTM-based approaches.

                The optimization of mental practice (MP) protocols matters for sport and motor rehabilitation. In this study, we were interested in the benefits of aerobic exercise in MP, given its positive effects on the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills induced by physical practice (PP). Four experimental groups were tested: i) physical practice without exercise (PP-Rest), ii) mental practice without exercise (MP-Rest), iii) mental practice preceded by Exercise (Exe-MP), and iv) mental practice followed by Exercise (MP-Exe). We hypothesized that exercise before MP would potentiate motor acquisition, whereas exercise after MP would further promote motor consolidation. Motor performance (movement speed and accuracy) was measured during a sequential finger tapping task before (Pre-Test), immediately after (Post-Test 0h, acquisition), and one day after practice (Post-Test 24h, consolidation). Results suggest that exercise before MP did not additionally improve motor acquisition in comparison to the MP-Rest group. Interestingly, aerobic exercise after MP further increased performance during motor consolidation, at the level of the PP-Rest group. This novel finding represents a promising advance in the optimization of mental practice protocols in sport-related and rehabilitation settings.

                Understanding how motor cortex encodes and decodes behaviors is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, which faces significant challenges because task-relevant neural responses are entangled with considerable task-irrelevant nuisance signals. Due to the entanglement, it is difficult to determine to extract which part and how much neural activity to study neural mechanisms. To cope with this puzzle, current studies usually extract a subset of neural responses that satisfy empirical hypotheses from noisy signals for analysis, which may lead to a one-sided understanding of neural mechanisms. Here we proposed a new perspective --- extracting complete task-relevant signals --- to explore neural mechanisms and offered a distillation framework to distill signals. Analyzing data in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, distilled task-relevant signals reveal unexpected complex encoding but simple decoding mechanisms in motor cortex.

                Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are used in a wide array of experimental situations for driving expression of biosensors, recombinases and opto/chemo-genetic actuators in the brain. However, conventional approaches for minimally invasive, spatially precise and ultra-sparse AAV mediated transduction of cells during imaging experiments, has remained a significant challenge. Here we show that intravenous injection of commercially available AAVs at different doses, combined with laser based perforation of single cortical capillaries through a cranial widow, allows for ultra-sparse, titrate-able, and micron level precision for delivery of viral vectors with relatively little inflammation or tissue damage. Further, we show the utility of this approach for eliciting sparse expression of GCaMP6, channel-rhodopsin or fluorescent reporters in neurons and astrocytes within specific functional domains in normal and stroke damaged cortex. This technique represents a facile approach for targeted delivery of viral vectors that should assist in the study of cell types and circuits in the cerebral cortex.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein in the form of Lewy pathology. While most cases are sporadic, there are rare genetic mutations that cause disease and more common variants that increase incidence of disease. The most prominent genetic mutations for PD and DLB are in the GBA1 and LRRK2 genes. GBA1 mutations are associated with decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and lysosomal accumulation of its lipid substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Previous studies have shown a link between this enzyme and lipids even in sporadic PD. However, it is unclear how the protein pathologies of disease are related to enzyme activity and glycosphingolipid levels. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined quantitative protein pathology, glucocerebrosidase activity and lipid substrates in parallel from 4 regions of 91 brains with no neurological disease, idiopathic, GBA1-linked, or LRRK2-linked PD and DLB. We find that several biomarkers are altered with respect to mutation and disease severity. We found mild association of glucocerebrosidase activity with disease, but a strong association of glucosylsphingosine with 8-synuclein pathology, irrespective of genetic mutation. This association suggests that Lewy pathology precipitates changes in lipid levels related to disease severity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biomimetic microstimulation of sensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is being researched to treat neurological disease or injury. Biomimetic microstimulation, or stimulus trains that mimic neural activity in the brain, made sensations more focal and natural in a human participant, but it is not understood how biomimetic microstimulation affects neural activation. Adaptation (decreases in evoked intensity over time) is also a potential barrier to clinical implementation of sensory feedback, and biomimetic microstimulation may reduce this effect. Objective: We evaluated how biomimetic trains change the calcium response, spatial distribution, and adaptation of neurons in the somatosensory and visual cortices. Methods: Calcium responses of neurons were measured in Layer 2/3 of visual and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized GCaMP6s mice in response to ICMS trains with fixed amplitude and frequency (Fixed) and three biomimetic ICMS trains that increased the stimulation intensity during the onset and offset of stimulation by modulating the amplitude (BioAmp), frequency (BioFreq), or amplitude and frequency (BioBoth). ICMS was provided for either 1-s with 4-s breaks (Short) or for 30-s with 15-s breaks (Long). Results: BioAmp and BioBoth trains evoked distinct onset and offset transients in recruited neurons, while BioFreq trains evoked activity similar to Fixed trains. Biomimetic amplitude reduced adaptation (decreases in evoked calcium intensity) by 14.6 +/- 0.3% for Short and 36.1 +/- 0.6% for Long trains. Ideal observers were 0.031 +/- 0.009s faster for onset detection and 1.33 +/- 0.21s faster for offset detection with biomimetic amplitude. Conclusions: Biomimetic amplitude modulation evokes distinct onset and offset transients, reduces adaptation, and decreases total charge injection for sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monkey-to-human transfer of brain computer interface decoders</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) enable paralyzed persons to generate movement, but current methods require large amounts of both neural and movement-related data to be collected from the iBCI user for supervised decoder training. We hypothesized that the low-dimensional latent neural representations of motor behavior, known to be preserved across time, might also be preserved across individuals, and allow us to circumvent this problem. We trained a decoder to predict the electromyographic (EMG) activity for a 'source' monkey from the latent signals of motor cortex. We then used Canonical Correlation Analysis to align the latent signals of a 'target' monkey to those of the source. These decoders were as accurate across monkeys as they were across sessions for a given monkey. Remarkably, the same process with latent signals from a human participant with tetraplegia was within 90% of the with-monkey decoding across session accuracy. Our findings suggest that consistent representations of motor activity exist across animals and even species. Discovering this common representation is a crucial first step in designing iBCI decoders that perform well without large amounts of data and supervised subject-specific tuning.

                During development, retinal axons create broad and imprecise connections in the thalamus. This topology, very different from adults, supplies developing thalamic neurons with locally homogeneous synaptic currents and should cause spike correlation between thalamocortical neurons on a millisecond timescale. Such correlations have not been observed in vivo, at these ages, and would likely be maladaptive. Here, we use a biophysical model of the visual thalamus with the membrane and synaptic properties of 7-10 day-old mice to show that the developmentally appropriate dominance of NMDA-receptor currents and absence of strong recurrent inhibitory and excitatory connections prevents precise correlation and preserves topographic information in thalamic spikes. We illustrate possible reasons for this desynchronization using a phenomenological cortical model, which shows impaired network diversity when driven with precisely correlated inputs. Our results suggest that developing synapses and circuits evolved mechanisms to compensate for detrimental, "parasitic" correlation arising from the unrefined and immature circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebello-Basal Ganglia Functional Network Integration in Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Psychotic disorders are conceptualized as brain-network diseases and both the cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) are implicated in widely used conceptual models. Previous research has focused on these structures and their respective circuits as distinct, however, both are functionally and anatomically connected to each other and to cortical networks via domain-specific, topographically organized thalamo-cortical loops. Currently, it is unclear how CB-BG network dysfunction may play a mechanistic role in the course of psychosis; however, network global efficiency (GE), a measure of functional integration, is a novel approach that aims to represent cognitive and motor CB-BG network (CCBN, MCBN, respectively) connectivity in cross-sectional groups of healthy control (HC), clinical high-risk (CHR), early course psychosis (ECP), and chronic psychosis (CP) participants. We compared network GE between groups and inspected individual differences in CCBN- and MCBN-GE as it relates to group membership and to psychosis symptoms. We also associated CB-BG network GE with cortical network GE. Results indicated that CCBN-GE was associated with cognitive dysfunction and lower in CHR individuals, compared to HC and CP; while MCBN was associated with negative psychosis symptoms. Last, we detailed CB-BG associations with sensory, motor, default mode, and salience networks across groups, with group effects demonstrating complex differences within the ECP group. Findings indicating that CB-BG network dysfunction may play an important role in early pathogenesis and authors argue for CB-BG dysfunction to be analyzed from a network perspective. Future work is needed however to incorporate this approach into our understanding of psychosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of spatial location by frontal orienting field neurons</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Frontal cortical areas seem to encode upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks make it challenging to determine whether activity represents a planned movement direction in a self-centered reference frame or a goal position in a world-centered reference frame. Here, we trained rats to make delayed visually-guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle position versus direction tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. We found neurons in the FOF that were tuned for specific directions of movement and also neurons that fired while animals were at specific port positions. Interestingly, after the visual cue onset, movement direction tuning emerged earlier than target position tuning. At the level of individual neurons, the current head position modulated the planned movement direction as a gain field. These results suggest the FOF participates not only in the motoric processes of sensorimotor behavior, which could happen strictly in egocentric coordinates, but in more complex aspects like reference frame transformation or maintaining a stable model of the world during movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different control strategies drive interlimb differences in performance and adaptation during reaching movements in novel dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit lateralization such that most individuals typically show a preference for using one arm over the other for a range of movement tasks. The computational aspects of movement control leading to these differences in skill are not yet understood. It has been hypothesized that the dominant and non-dominant arms differ in terms of the use of predictive or impedance control mechanisms. However, previous studies present confounding factors that prevented clear conclusions: either the performances were compared across two different groups, or in a design in which asymmetrical transfer between limbs could take place. To address these concerns, we studied a reach adaptation task during which healthy volunteers performed movements with their right and left arms in random order. We performed two experiments. Experiment 1 (18 participants) focused on adaptation to the presence of a perturbing force field and Experiment 2 (12 participants) focused on rapid adaptations in feedback responses. The randomization of the left and right arm led to simultaneous adaptation, allowing us to study lateralization in single individuals with symmetrical and minimal transfer between limbs. This design revealed that participants were able to adapt control of both arms, and that adaptation was greater in the dominant arm than in the non-dominant. We also observed that the non-dominant arm showed a different control strategy compatible with robust control when adapting to the force field perturbation. EMG data showed that these differences in control were not caused by differences in co-contraction across the arms. Thus, instead of assuming differences in predictive or reactive control schemes, our data show that in the context of optimal control, both arms can adapt, and that the non-dominant arm uses a more robust, model-free strategy likely to compensate for less accurate internal representations of movement dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemodynamic timing in resting-state and breathing-task BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus demonstrates regional heterogeneity across both the healthy brain and in cerebrovascular pathology. The timing of a regional hemodynamic response is emerging as an important biomarker of cerebrovascular dysfunction, as well as a methodological confound within fMRI analyses. Previous research demonstrated that hemodynamic timing is more robustly characterized when a larger systemic vascular response is evoked by a breathing challenge, compared to when only spontaneous fluctuations in vascular physiology are present (i.e., in resting-state data). However, it is not clear whether hemodynamic delays in these two conditions are physiologically interchangeable, and how methodological signal-to-noise factors may limit their agreement. To address this, we generated whole-brain maps of hemodynamic delays in nine healthy adults. We assessed the agreement of voxelwise gray matter (GM) hemodynamic delays between two conditions: resting-state and breath-holding. We found that delay values demonstrated poor agreement when considering all GM voxels, but increasingly greater agreement when limiting analyses to voxels showing strong correlation with the GM mean time-series. Voxels showing the strongest agreement with the GM mean time-series were primarily located near large venous vessels, however these voxels explain some, but not all, of the observed agreement in timing. Increasing the degree of spatial smoothing of the fMRI data enhanced the correlation between individual voxel time-series and the GM mean time-series and did not substantially change the agreement in hemodynamic timing as a function of this relationship strength. These results suggest that signal-to-noise factors may be limiting the accuracy of voxelwise timing estimates and hence their agreement between the two data segments. In conclusion, caution must be taken when using voxelwise delay estimates from resting-state and breathing-task data interchangeably, and additional work is needed to evaluate their relative sensitivity and specificity to aspects of vascular physiology and pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Central extended amygdala neurons in the development of activity-based anorexia</a></h4>

              
                Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disease characterized by restricted eating, fear of gaining weight, as well as excessive exercise, and also is often comorbid with emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, the etiology of AN is unknown and the neural mechanism that leads to AN remains to be determined. Here, we show that a specific subpopulation of neurons, marked by the expression of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-{delta}), in two nuclei of the central extended amygdala (EAc)-central nucleus (CeA) and oval region of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (ovBNST)-regulates development of activity-based anorexia (ABA), the current best animal model of AN. Specifically, simultaneous dual ablation of CeAPKC-{delta} and ovBNSTPKC-{delta} neurons prevents the key phenotypes of ABA: increases in wheel activity, decreases in food intake, and life-threatening body weight loss. However, ablating PKC-{delta} neurons in CeA or ovBNST alone is not sufficient to prevent ABA. Correspondingly, activation of PKC-{delta} neurons in one type of nuclei continues to suppress food intake even when PKC-{delta} neurons in the other nuclei are silenced. Consistent with their role in suppressing food intake when activated, these PKC-{delta} neurons show increased activity with ABA development. Together, our study illuminates how neurons in the amygdala regulate ABA development and supports the complex and heterogenous etiology of AN.

                Although stroke is the main cause of brain damage worldwide, stroke therapies are based on blood reperfusion and do not target cerebral parenchyma. Ischemic stroke (representing 87% of all strokes) causes cerebral damage due to oxygen and tissue energy depletion, which lead to acidosis, inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous gasotransmitter produced by heme oxygenase cleavage of the heme group. CO promotes cytoprotection by limiting inflammation and preventing cell death in several tissues including the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated the protective role of CO in the mouse ischemic stroke model, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by histological analysis when CO is when applied before ischemia. Herein, there are two main novelties. First CO is administrated following stroke, which better mimics its potential future use as therapeutic drug. Secondly, imaging techniques were used to elucidate the effect of this gasotransmitter at the metabolic, vascular and anatomic levels. The putative neuroprotective effects of CO following MCAo were assessed by 3 i.p. injections of the CO-releasing molecule CORM-A1 (3 mg/kg), administered 6, 24 and 48h after reperfusion. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed 1 day and 7 days after reperfusion using T2-weighted, diffusion weighted images, proton spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and perfusion (dynamic contrast enhanced images). 1H-MRS also allowed the comparison between metabolite signatures at day 1 versus 7 day following MCAo. Furthermore, CORM-A1 limited the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity as it reduced the edema formation. Furthermore, the CO donor minimized the metabolite load loss at an early stage after MCAo, both in striatum and cortex. In conclusion and based on MRI analysis, CO has a protective role in the recovery from stroke injury, mainly by acting on BBB integrity and brain metabolism.

                People often have good intentions but fail to adhere to them. Implementation intentions, a form of strategic planning, can help people to close this intention-behavior gap. Their effectiveness has been proposed to depend on the mental formation of a stimulus-response association between a trigger and target behavior, thereby creating an instant habit. If implementation intentions do indeed lead to reliance on habitual control, then this may come at the cost of reduced behavioral flexibility. Furthermore, we would expect a shift from recruitment of corticostriatal brain regions implicated in goal-directed control towards habit regions. To test these ideas, we performed a functional MRI study in which participants received instrumental training supported by either implementation or goal intentions, followed by an outcome-revaluation to test reliance on habitual versus goal-directed control. We found that implementation intentions led to increased efficiency during training, as reflected in higher accuracy, faster reaction times, and decreased engagement of the anterior caudate. However, implementation intentions did not reduce behavioral flexibility when goals changed during the test phase, nor did it affect the underlying corticostriatal pathways. Additionally, this study showed that slips of action towards devalued outcomes are associated with reduced activity in brain regions implicated in goal-directed control. In conclusion, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggest that strategic if-then planning does not lead to a shift from goal-directed towards habitual control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off-Vertical Body Orientation Delays the Perceived Onset of Visual Motion</a></h4>

              
                The integration of vestibular, visual and body cues is a fundamental process in the perception of self-motion and is commonly experienced in an upright posture. However, when the body is tilted in an off-vertical orientation these signals are no longer aligned relative to the influence of gravity. In this study, sensory conflict with the vestibular signal was introduced by manipulating the orientation of the body, generating a mismatch between body and vestibular cues due to gravity in the perception of upright and creating an ambiguous vestibular signal of either head tilt or translation. In a series of temporal-order judgment tasks, participants reported the perceived onset of a visual scene simulating rotation around the yaw axis presented in virtual reality with a paired auditory tone while in an upright, supine and side recumbent body positions. The results revealed that the perceived onset of visual motion was further delayed from zero (i.e., true simultaneity between visual onset and a reference auditory tone) by approximately an additional 30ms when viewed in a supine or side recumbent orientation compared to an upright posture. There were also no significant differences in the timing estimates of the visual motion between all the non-upright orientations. This indicates that the perceived timing of visual motion is negatively impacted by the presence of conflict in the vestibular and body signals due to the direction of gravity and body orientation, even when the mismatch is not in the direct plane of the axis of rotation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide representations of behavior spanning multiple timescales and states in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Changes in an animal's behavior and internal state are accompanied by widespread changes in activity across its brain. However, how neurons across the brain encode behavior and how this is impacted by state is poorly understood. We recorded brain-wide activity and the diverse motor programs of freely-moving C. elegans and built probabilistic models that explain how each neuron encodes quantitative features of the animal's behavior. By determining the identities of the recorded neurons, we created, for the first time, an atlas of how the defined neuron classes in the C. elegans connectome encode behavior. Many neuron classes have conjunctive representations of multiple behaviors. Moreover, while many neurons encode current motor actions, others encode recent actions. Changes in behavioral state are accompanied by widespread changes in how neurons encode behavior, and we identify these flexible nodes in the connectome. Our results provide a global map of how the cell types across an animal's brain encode its behavior.
