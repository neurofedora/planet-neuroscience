<p>We model human decision-making behaviors in a risk-taking task using inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) for the purposes of understanding real human
decision making under risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work applying IRL to reveal the implicit reward function in human risk-taking
decision making and to interpret risk-prone and risk-averse decision-making
policies. We hypothesize that the state history (e.g. rewards and decisions in
previous trials) are related to the human reward function, which leads to
risk-averse and risk-prone decisions. We design features that reflect these
factors in the reward function of IRL and learn the corresponding weight that
is interpretable as the importance of features. The results confirm the
sub-optimal risk-related decisions of human-driven by the personalized reward
function. In particular, the risk-prone person tends to decide based on the
current pump number, while the risk-averse person relies on burst information
from the previous trial and the average end status. Our results demonstrate
that IRL is an effective tool to model human decision-making behavior, as well
as to help interpret the human psychological process in risk decision-making.

<p>Asynchronous irregular (AI) and critical states are two competing frameworks
proposed to explain spontaneous neuronal activity. Here, we propose a
mean-field model with simple stochastic neurons that generalizes the
integrate-and-fire network of Brunel (2000). We show that the point with
balanced inhibitory/excitatory synaptic weight ratio $g_c \approx 4$
corresponds to a second order absorbing phase transition usual in
self-organized critical (SOC) models. At the synaptic balance point $g_c$, the
network exhibits power-law neuronal avalanches with the usual exponents,
whereas for nonzero external field the system displays the four usual
synchronicity states of balanced networks. We add homeostatic inhibition and
firing rate adaption and obtain a self-organized quasi-critical balanced state
with avalanches and AI-like activity. Our model might explain why different
inhibition levels are obtained in different experimental conditions and for
different regions of the brain, since at least two dynamical mechanisms are
necessary to obtain a truly balanced state, without which the network may hover
in different regions of the presented theoretical phase diagram.

<p>We study a model of spiking neurons, with recurrent connections that result
from learning a set of spatio-temporal patterns with a spike-timing dependent
plasticity rule and a global inhibition. We investigate the ability of the
network to store and selectively replay multiple patterns of spikes, with a
combination of spatial population and phase-of-spike code. Each neuron in a
pattern is characterized by a binary variable determining if the neuron is
active in the pattern, and a phase-lag variable representing the spike-timing
order among the active units. After the learning stage, we study the dynamics
of the network induced by a brief cue stimulation, and verify that the network
is able to selectively replay the pattern correctly and persistently. We
calculate the information capacity of the network, defined as the maximum
number of patterns that can be encoded in the network times the number of bits
carried by each pattern, normalized by the number of synapses, and find that it
can reach a value $\alpha_\text{max}\simeq 0.27$, similar to the one of
sequence processing neural networks, and almost double of the capacity of the
static Hopfield model. We study the dependence of the capacity on the global
inhibition, connection strength (or neuron threshold) and fraction of neurons
participating to the patterns. The results show that a dual population and
temporal coding can be optimal for the capacity of an associative memory.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05369">Modeling functional resting-state brain networks through neural message passing on the human connectome. (arXiv:1906.05369v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the
human brain is one of the most important open questions in Neurosciences. In
particular, Resting State Networks (RSN) and more specifically the Default Mode
Network (DMN) of the brain, which are defined from the analysis of functional
data lack a definitive justification consistent with the anatomical structure
of the brain. In this work, we show that a possible connection may naturally
rest on the idea that information flows in the brain through a neural
message-passing dynamics between macroscopic structures, like those defined by
the human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region in the HC is assumed
to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strength of interactions among
them is encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and
the dynamics of the system is defined by a neural message-passing algorithm,
Belief Propagation (BP), working near the critical point of the human
connectome. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP
algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the DMN.
Moreover, we computed, using Susceptibility Propagation (SP), the matrix of
correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by
a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting States Networks determined
experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be
seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a
neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. We then show
preliminary results indicating our predictions on how functional DMN maps
change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural anomalies, like in
Alzheimers Disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum.

Although the evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been used as a priori knowledge for further studies, whether these functions are conserved between species remains unclear. In particular, whether macroscopic connectivity supports this given the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions that project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas, has not been established. The evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been suggested and used as a priori knowledge for further studies. However, whether this hypothesis is supported by macroscopic connectivity remains unclear, especially when considering the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions known to project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas. In this study, the human and macaque striatum was first tractographically parcellated to define the ventral striatum and its two subregions, the nucleus accumbens (Acb)-like and the neurochemically unique domains of the Acb and putamen (NUDAPs)-like divisions. Our results revealed a similar topographical distribution of the connectivity-based ventral striatal components in the two primate brains. Successively, a set of targets was extracted to construct a connectivity fingerprint to characterize these parcellation results, enabling cross-species comparisons. Our results indicated that the connectivity fingerprints of the ventral striatum-like divisions were dissimilar in the two species. We localized this difference to specific targets to analyze possible interspecies functional modifications. Our results also revealed interspecies-convergent connectivity ratio fingerprints of the target group to these two ventral striatum-like subregions. This convergence may suggest synchronous connectional changes of these ventral striatal components during primate evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00619">The Age-Related Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Silent Impairment of the Cognitive Ear</a></h4>

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also called presbycusis, is a progressive disorder affecting hearing functions and among the elderly has been recognized as the third most frequent condition. Among ARHL components, the age-related central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) refers to changes in the auditory network, negatively impacting auditory perception and/or the speech communication performance. The relationship between auditory-perception and speech communication difficulties in age-related CAPD is difficult to establish, mainly because many older subjects have concomitant peripheral ARHL and age-related cognitive changes. In the last two decades, the association between cognitive impairment and ARHL has received great attention. Peripheral ARHL has recently been defined as the modifiable risk factor with the greatest impact on the development of dementia. Even if very few studies have analyzed the relationship between cognitive decline and age-related CAPD, a strong association was highlighted. Therefore, age-related CAPD could be a specific process related to neurodegeneration. Since these two disorders can be concomitant, drawing causal inferences is difficult. The assumption that ARHL, particularly age-related CAPD, may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly remains unchallenged. This review aims to summarize the evidence of associations between age-related CAPD and cognitive disorders and to define the diagnostic procedure of CAPD in the elderly. Finally, we highlight the importance of tailoring the rehabilitation strategy to this relationship. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and the use of adequate assessment tools that can disentangle cognitive dysfunction from sensory impairments are warranted.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a unique molecular tool to get in vivo access to a wide spectrum of biological and neuropathological processes, of crucial relevance for neurodegenerative conditions. Although most PET findings are based on massive univariate approaches, in the last decade the increasing interest in multivariate methods has paved the way to the assessment of unexplored cerebral features, spanning from resting state brain networks to whole-brain connectome properties. Currently, the combination of molecular neuroimaging techniques with multivariate connectivity methods represents one of the most powerful, yet still emerging, approach to achieve novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this Review, we will summarize the available evidence in the field of PET molecular connectivity, with the aim to provide an overview of how these studies may increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, over and above “traditional” structural/functional connectivity studies. Considering the available evidence, a major focus will be represented by molecular connectivity studies using [18F]FDG-PET, today applied in the major neuropathological spectra, from amyloidopathies and tauopathies to synucleinopathies and beyond. Pioneering studies using PET tracers targeting brain neuropathology and neurotransmission systems for connectivity studies will be discussed, and their strengths and limitations highlighted with reference to both applied methodology and results interpretation. The most common methods for molecular connectivity assessment will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on the available strategies to investigate molecular connectivity at the single-subject level, of potential relevance for not only research but also diagnostic purposes. Finally, we will highlight possible future perspectives in the field, with reference in particular to newly available PET tracers, which will expand the application of molecular connectivity to new, exciting, unforeseen possibilities.

Studies of functional neurosurgery and electroencephalography in Parkinson’s disease have demonstrated abnormally synchronous activity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. 
Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations.
The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data.
Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts.
FMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. 
EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain.
This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00603">Hybrid Functional Brain Network With First-Order and Second-Order Information for Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Schizophrenia</a></h4>

Brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) analysis has been widely used in diagnosis of mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In BFCN methods, the brain network construction is one of the core tasks due to its great influence on the diagnosis result. Most of the existing BFCN construction methods only consider the first-order relationship existing in each pair of brain regions and ignore the useful high-order information, including multi-regions correlation in the whole brain. Some of the early schizophrenia patients have subtle changes in brain function networks, which cannot be detected in conventional BFCN construction methods. It is well known that the high-order method is usually more sensitive to the subtle changes in signal than the low-order method. For exploiting the high-order information among brain regions, we define the triplet correlation among three brain regions, and derive the second-order brain network based on the connectivity difference and ordinal information in each triplet. For making full use of the complementary information in different brain networks, we proposed a hybrid approach to fuse the first-order and second-order brain networks. The proposed method is applied to identifying the biomarkers of schizophrenia. The experimental results on six schizophrenia datasets (totally including 439 patients and 426 controls) show that the proposed method outperforms the existing brain network methods in diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Tissue morphology and mechanics are crucial to the regulation of organ function. Investigating the exceptionally complex tissue of the brain at the sub-micron scale turns out to be challenging due to the complex structure and softness of this tissue despite the large interest of biologist, medical engineers, biophysicists and other sin this topic. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) both as an imaging and as a mechanical tool provides an excellent opportunity to study soft biological samples such as live brain tissues. Here we review the principles of AFM, the performance of AFM in tissue imaging and me-chanical mapping of cells and tissues, and finally opening the prospects and challenges of probing the biophysical properties of brain tissue using AFM.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders are characterized by filamentous or fibrous structures consisting of abnormal α-synuclein in the brains of patients, and the distributions and spread of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression. L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) is the most effective therapy for PD, but it remains unclear whether the drug has any effect on the formation and propagation of pathogenic abnormal α-synuclein in vivo. Here, we tested whether or not L-DOPA influences the prion-like spread of α-synuclein pathologies in a wild-type mouse model of α-synuclein propagation. To quantitate the pathological α-synuclein in mice, we prepared brain sections stained with an anti-phosphoSer129 (PS129) antibody after pretreatments with autoclaving and formic acid, and carefully analyzed positive aggregates on multiple sections covering the areas of interest using a microscope. Notably, a significant reduction in the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein was detected in substantia nigra of L-DOPA/benserazide (a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor)-treated mice, compared with control mice. These results suggest that L-DOPA may slow the progression of PD in vivo by suppressing the aggregation of α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons and the cell-to-cell propagation of abnormal α-synuclein. This is the first report describing the suppressing effect of L-DOPA/benserazide on the propagation of pathological α-synuclein. The experimental protocols and detection methods in this study are expected to be useful for evaluation of drug candidates or new therapies targeting the propagation of α-synuclein.

Spinal cord edema,mainly including vasogenic and cytotoxic edema,influence neurological outcome after spinal cord contusion (SCC).Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the most ubiquitous water channel in central nervous system (CNS),which is a rate-limiting factor in vasogenic edema expressing in brain injury,and it contributes to the formation of cytotoxic edema locating in astrocytes.However,little is known the regulatory mechanism of AQP4 within vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in SCC,and whether regulation mechanism of AQP4 is related to Cytochrome coxidase (COX5A) affecting energy metabolism.Therefore,SCC model is established by Allen’s method,and the degree of edema and neuronal area is measured.Motor function of rats is evaluated by the Basso,Beattie,and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system.Meanwhile,AQP4 and COX5A are detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB).localization of targeted protein is exhibited by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and immunofluoresce (IF).Besides,the methodology of AQP4 lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (AQP4-RNAi) is used to reveal the effect on edema of SCC and the regulating molecular mechanism. Firstly,we observe that tissue water content increase after SCC,and decrease after the peak value of tissue water content at 3 days (P&lt;0.05) with abundant expression of AQP4 protein locating around vascular endothelial cells,which suggests that the increasing AQP4 promotes water reabsorption and improves vasogenic edema in the early stage of SCC.However,neuronal area is larger than sham group in the 7 days(P&lt;0.05) with the total water content of spinal cord decrease.Meanwhile AQP4 migrate from vascular endothelial cells to neuronal cytomembrane,which indicates that AQP4 play a crucial role in aggravating the formation and development of cytotoxic edema in the middle stages of SCC. Secondly,AQP4-RNAi is used to elucidate the mechanism of AQP4 to edema of SCC.The neuronal area shrinks and the area of cytotoxic edema reduces after AQP4 downregulation.BBB scores is significantly higher than vector group after AQP4-RNAi at 5d,7d and 14d(P &lt; 0.05).There is a relationship between AQP4 and COX5A shown by bioinformatics analysis.After AQP4 inhibition,expression of COX5A significantly up-regulated in the swelling astrocytes.Therefore,inhibition of AQP4 expression reduces cytotoxic edema in SCC and improves motor function,which may associate with upregulation of COX5A via affecting energy metabolism.Moreover,it isn’t clear how the inhibition of AQP4 directly causes the upregulation of COX5A.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00205">Semantic Processing in Bilingual Aphasia: Evidence of Language Dependency</a></h4>

Individuals with aphasia frequently show lexical retrieval deficits due to increased interference of semantically related competitors, a phenomenon that can be observed in tasks such as naming pictures grouped by semantic category. These deficits are explained in terms of impaired semantic control, a set of abilities that are to some extent dependent upon executive control (EC). However, the extent to which semantic control abilities can be affected in a second and non-dominant language has not been extensively explored. Additionally, findings in healthy individuals are inconclusive regarding the degree to which semantic processing is shared between languages. In this study, we explored the effect of brain damage on semantic processing by comparing the performance of bilingual individuals with aphasia on tasks involving semantic control during word production and comprehension. Furthermore, we explored whether semantic deficits are related to domain-general (EC) deficits. 
First, we investigated the naming performance of Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with fluent aphasia and age-matched healthy controls on a semantically blocked cyclic naming task in each of their two languages. This task measured semantic interference in terms of the difference in naming latencies between pictures grouped by the same semantic category or different categories. Second, we explored whether lexical deficits extend to comprehension by testing participants in a word-picture matching task during a mixed language condition. Third, we used a conflict monitoring task to explore the presence of EC deficits in patients. 
We found two main results. First, in both language tasks, bilingual patients’ performances were more affected than those of healthy controls when they performed the task in their non-dominant language. Second, there was a significant correlation between the speed of processing on the EC task and the magnitude of the semantic interference effect exclusively in the non-dominant language.
Taken together, these results suggest that lexical retrieval may be selectively impaired in bilinguals within those conditions where semantic competition is higher and this could be explained by an excessive amount of language inhibition. Moreover, lexico-semantic impairments seem to be at least somewhat related to conflict monitoring deficits, suggesting a certain degree of overlap between EC and semantic control.

Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuropsychological disconnection syndrome that can be analysed using various complex network metrics used as pathology biomarkers. Recently, community detection and analysis rooted in the complex network and graph theories have been introduced to investigate the changes in resting-state functional network community structure under neurological pathologies. However, the potential of hidden patterns in the modular organisation of networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict brain pathology has never been investigated. In this study, we present a novel analysis technique to identify alterations in community patterns in functional networks under ASD. In addition, we design machine learning classifiers to predict the clinical class of patients with ASD and controls by using only community pattern quality metrics as features. Analyses conducted on six publicly available datasets from 235 subjects, including patients with ASD and age-matched controls revealed that the modular structure is significantly disturbed in patients with ASD. Machine learning algorithms showed that the predictive power of our five metrics is relatively high (~85.16 peak accuracy for in-site data and ~75.00% peak accuracy for multisite data). These results lend further credence to the dysconnectivity theory of this pathology.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have previously been shown to be useful tools for signal decoding and analysis in a variety of complex domains, such as image processing and speech recognition. By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45573">Coding strategies in the otolith system differ for translational head motion vs static orientation relative to gravity</a></h4>

The detection of gravito-inertial forces by the otolith system is essential for our sense of balance and accurate perception. To date, however, how this system encodes self-motion stimuli experienced during everyday activities remains unknown. Here we directly addressed this fundamental question by recording from single otolith afferents in monkeys during naturalistic translational self-motion and changes in static head orientation. Otolith afferents with higher intrinsic variability transmitted overall more information about translational self-motion than their regular counterparts, due to stronger nonlinearities that enabled precise spike timing including phase locking. In contrast, more regular afferents better discriminated between different static head orientations relative to gravity. Using computational methods, we further demonstrated that coupled increases in intrinsic variability and sensitivity accounted for observed functional differences between afferent classes. Together, our results indicate that irregular and regular otolith afferents may use different strategies to encode naturalistic self-motion and static head orientation relative to gravity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45205">Protein quality control in the nucleolus safeguards recovery of epigenetic regulators after heat shock</a></h4>

Maintenance of epigenetic modifiers is of utmost importance to preserve the epigenome and consequently appropriate cellular functioning. Here, we analyzed Polycomb group protein (PcG) complex integrity in response to heat shock (HS). Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible. This post-heat shock recovery of pan-nuclear CBX protein localization and reinstallation of epigenetic marks is HSP70 dependent. Our findings demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control center, which is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and maintenance of the epigenome after heat shock.

Tying the hands behind the back has detrimental effect of sensorimotor perceptual tasks. Here we provide evidence that beta band oscillatory activity in a resting state condition might have a crucial role in such detrimental effects. EEG activity in a resting state condition was measured from thirty participants in two different body posture conditions. In one condition participants were required to keep their hands freely resting on the table. In the other condition, participants were required to keep the hands tied behind their back. Increased beta power was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (l-IFG) during the tied hands condition compared to the free hands condition. A control study ruled out alternative explanations including muscle tension that might have affected the EEG data. Our findings provide new insight on how body postural manipulations impact on perceptual tasks and intrinsic brain activity.

Humans show systematic biases when estimating probability of uncertain events. Base-rate neglect is a well-known bias that describes the tendency to underweight information from the past relative to the present. In this study, we characterized base-rate neglect at the computational and neural implementation levels. At the computational level, we established that base-rate neglect arises from insufficient adjustment to weighting prior information in response to changes in prior variability. At the neural implementation level, we found that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) represent subjective weighting of information that reflects base-rate neglect. Critically, both subjective-weight and subjective-value signals that guide choice were found in mPFC. However, subjective-weight signals preceded subjective-value signals. These results indicate that when facing multiple sources of information, estimation bias such as base-rate neglect arises from information weighting computed in OFC and mPFC, which directly contributes to subjective-value computations that guide decisions under uncertainty.

Bipolar Disorder (BP) is a mental disorder that affects 1-2% of the population. Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can benefit from associated biological markers. The existing methods typically utilize biomarkers, region of interests (ROIs) from anatomical MRI or functional BOLD imaging, but lack the ability of revealing the relationship between integrated modalities and disease. In this paper, we developed an Edge-weighted Graph Attention Network (EGAT) with Dense Hierarchical Pooling (DHP), to better understand the underlying roots of the disorder from the view of structure-function integration. For the input, the underlying graphs are constructed from functional connectivity matrices and the nodal features consist of both the anatomical features and the statistics of the connectivity. We investigated the potential benefits of using EGAT to classify BP vs. Healthy Control (HC). Compared with traditional machine learning classifiers, our proposed EGAT embedding increased improved 10-20% in the accuracy and F1-score, compared with alternative classifiers. More specifically, by examining the attention map and gradient sensitivity of nodal features, we indicated that associated with the abnormality of anatomical geometric properties, multiple interactive patterns among Default Mode, Fronto-parietal and Cingulo-opercular networks contribute to identifying BP.

Populations of neurons in the neocortex can carry information with both the synchrony and the rate of their spikes. However, it is unknown whether distinct subtypes of neurons in the cortical microcircuit are more sensitive to information carried by synchrony versus rate. Here, we address this question using patterned optical stimulation in slices of barrel cortex from transgenic mouse lines labelling distinct interneuron populations: fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. We use optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expressing excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 in order to encode a random 1-bit signal in either the synchrony or rate of activity. We then examine the mutual information between this 1-bit signal and the voltage and spiking responses in PV+ and SST+ interneurons. Generally, we find that both interneuron types carry more information than GFP negative control cells. More specifically, we find that for a synchrony encoding, PV+ interneurons carry more information in the first 5 milliseconds, while both interneuron subtypes carry more information than negative controls in their later response. We also find that for a rate encoding, SST+ interneurons carry more information than either PV+ or negative controls after several milliseconds. These data demonstrate that inhibitory interneuron subtypes in the neocortex have distinct responses to information carried by synchrony versus rates of activity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/671222v1?rss=1">Entorhinal velocity signals reflect environmental geometry</a></h4>

The entorhinal cortex contains neural signals for representing self-location, including grid cells that fire in periodic locations and velocity signals that encode an animal's speed and head direction. Recent work revealed that the size and shape of the environment influences grid patterns. Whether entorhinal velocity signals are equally influenced or provide a universal metric for self-motion across environments remains unknown. Here, we report that changes to the size and shape of the environment result in re-scaling in entorhinal speed codes. Moreover, head direction cells re-organize in an experience-dependent manner to align with the axis of environmental change. A knockout mouse model allows a dissociation of the coordination between cell types, with grid and speed, but not head direction, cells responding in concert to environmental change. These results align with predictions of grid cell attractor models and point to inherent flexibility in the coding features of multiple functionally-defined entorhinal cell types.

Becoming a successful speaker depends on acquiring and learning grammatical dependencies between neighboring and non-neighboring linguistic elements (non-adjacent dependencies; NADs). Previous studies have demonstrated children's and adults' ability to distinguish NADs from NAD violations right after familiarization. However, demonstrating NAD-recollection and processing after retention is crucial to demonstrate NAD-learning. We tested 7-year-old's NAD-learning in a natural, non-native language on one day and NAD-recollection on the next day by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). Our results revealed ERPs with a more positive amplitude to NAD violations than correct NADs after familiarization on day one, but ERPs with a more negative amplitude to NAD violations on day two. This change from more positive to more negative ERPs to NAD violations possibly indicates that children's representations of NADs changed during an overnight retention period, potentially associated with children's NAD-learning. Indeed, both ERP patterns (i.e., day one: positive, day two: negative) were related to stronger behavioral improvement (i.e., more correct answers on day two compared to day one) in a grammaticality judgment task from day one to day two. We suggest these findings to indicate that children showing more correct answers at day two, compared to day one, successfully built associative representations of NADs on day one and then successfully strengthened these associations during overnight retention, revealing NAD-recollection on day two. The present results suggest that 7-year-olds readily track NADs in a natural, non-native language and are able to show recollection after a retention period involving sleep, providing strong evidence of NAD-recollection.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/667204v1?rss=1">An S-cone circuit for edge detection in the primate retina</a></h4>

Midget retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the most common RGC type in the primate retina. Their responses mediate both color and spatial vision, yet the specific links between midget RGC responses and visual perception are unclear. Previous research on the dual roles of midget RGCs has focused on those comparing long (L) vs. middle (M) wavelength sensitive cones. However, there is evidence for several other rare midget RGC subtypes receiving S-cone input, but their role in color and spatial vision is uncertain. Here, we confirm the existence of the single S-cone center OFF midget RGC circuit in the central retina of macaque monkey both structurally and functionally, by combining single cell electrophysiology with 3D electron microscopy reconstructions of the upstream circuitry. Like the well-studied L vs. M midget RGCs, the S-OFF midget RGCs have a center-surround receptive field consistent with a role in spatial vision. While spectral opponency in a primate RGC is classically assumed to contribute to hue perception, a role supporting edge detection is more consistent with the S-OFF midget RGC receptive field structure and studies of hue perception.

A coarse-grain computational method integrates biophysical and structural data to generate models of HIV-1 genomic RNA, nucleocapsid and integrase condensed into a mature ribonucleoprotein complex. Several hypotheses for the initial structure of the genomic RNA and oligomeric state of integrase are tested. In these models, integrase interaction captures features of the relative distribution of gRNA in the immature virion and increases the size of the RNP globule, and exclusion of nucleocapsid from regions with RNA secondary structure drives an asymmetric placement of the dimerized 5’UTR at the surface of the RNP globule.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PIz1FT_1HWo" width="1" />

Different pediatric physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been described incorporating developmental changes that influence plasma drug concentrations. Drug disposition into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also subject to age-related variation and can be further influenced by brain diseases affecting blood-brain barrier integrity, like meningitis. Here, we developed a generic pediatric brain PBPK model to predict CSF concentrations of drugs that undergo passive transfer, including age-appropriate parameters. The model was validated for the analgesics paracetamol, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, and for a pediatric meningitis population by empirical optimization of the blood-brain barrier penetration of the antibiotic meropenem. Plasma and CSF drug concentrations derived from the literature were used to perform visual predictive checks and to calculate ratios between simulated and observed area under the concentration curves (AUCs) in order to evaluate model performance. Model-simulated concentrations were comparable to observed data over a broad age range (3 months– 15 years postnatal age) for all drugs investigated. The ratios between observed and simulated AUCs (AUCo/AUCp) were within 2-fold difference both in plasma (range 0.92–1.09) and in CSF (range 0.64–1.23) indicating acceptable model performance. The model was also able to describe disease-mediated changes in neonates and young children (&lt;3m postnatal age) related to meningitis and sepsis (range AUCo/AUCp plasma: 1.64–1.66, range AUCo/AUCp CSF: 1.43–1.73). Our model provides a new computational tool to predict CSF drug concentrations in children with and without meningitis and can be used as a template model for other compounds that passively enter the CNS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/knuIk8V6uds" width="1" />

Prolactin is a major hormone product of the pituitary gland, the central endocrine regulator. Despite its physiological importance, the cell-level mechanisms of prolactin production are not well understood. Having significantly improved the resolution of real-time-single-cell-GFP-imaging, the authors recently revealed that prolactin gene transcription is highly dynamic and stochastic yet shows space-time coordination in an intact tissue slice. However, it still remains an open question as to what kind of cellular communication mediates the observed space-time organization. To determine the type of interaction between cells we developed a statistical model. The degree of similarity between two expression time series was studied in terms of two distance measures, Euclidean and geodesic, the latter being a network-theoretic distance defined to be the minimal number of edges between nodes, and this was used to discriminate between juxtacrine from paracrine signalling. The analysis presented here suggests that juxtacrine signalling dominates. To further determine whether the coupling is coordinating transcription or post-transcriptional activities we used stochastic switch modelling to infer the transcriptional profiles of cells and estimated their similarity measures to deduce that their spatial cellular coordination involves coupling of transcription via juxtacrine signalling. We developed a computational model that involves an inter-cell juxtacrine coupling, yielding simulation results that show space-time coordination in the transcription level that is in agreement with the above analysis. The developed model is expected to serve as the prototype for the further study of tissue-level organised gene expression for epigenetically regulated genes, such as prolactin.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kGujBfF9Nq0" width="1" />

Bioinformatics has become an indispensable part of life science over the past 2 decades. However, bioinformatics education is not well integrated at the undergraduate level, especially in liberal arts colleges and regional universities in the United States. One significant obstacle pointed out by the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education is the lack of faculty in the bioinformatics area. Most current life science professors did not acquire bioinformatics analysis skills during their own training. Consequently, a great number of undergraduate and graduate students do not get the chance to learn bioinformatics or computational biology skills within a structured curriculum during their education. To address this gap, we developed a module-based, week-long short course to train small college and regional university professors with essential bioinformatics skills. The bioinformatics modules were built to be adapted by the professor-trainees afterward and used in their own classes. All the course materials can be accessed at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/JAXBD2K-ShortCourse.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1A2tFBJLYHE" width="1" />

<p>by Romain Ligneul</p>

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is one of the most common paradigms used to assess decision-making and executive functioning in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Several reinforcement-learning (RL) models were recently proposed to refine the qualitative and quantitative inferences that can be made about these processes based on IGT data. Yet, these models do not account for the complex exploratory patterns which characterize participants’ behavior in the task. Using a dataset of more than 500 subjects, we demonstrate the existence of sequential exploration in the IGT and we describe a new computational architecture disentangling exploitation, random exploration and sequential exploration in this large population of participants. The new Value plus Sequential Exploration (VSE) architecture provided a better fit than previous models. Parameter recovery, model recovery and simulation analyses confirmed the superiority of the VSE scheme. Furthermore, using the VSE model, we confirmed the existence of a significant reduction in directed exploration across lifespan in the IGT, as previously reported with other paradigms. Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily and flexibly fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients and contributing to the development of computational psychiatry.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U7LFl-EDtNo" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive hidden Markov model to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycho-linguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Cued speech production engages a distributed set of brain regions that must interact with each other to perform this behavior rapidly and precisely. To characterize the spatio-temporal properties of the networks engaged in picture naming, we recorded from electrodes placed directly on the brain surfaces of patients with epilepsy being evaluated for surgical resection. We used a flexible statistical model applied to broadband gamma to characterize changing brain interactions. Unlike conventional models, ours can identify changes on individual trials that correlate with behavior. Our results reveal that interactions between brain regions are consistent across trials. This flexible statistical model provides a useful platform for quantifying brain dynamics during cognitive processes.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of Yo‐mediated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is unclear. We applied cerebrospinal fluid and serum from PCD patients as well as CDR2 and CDR2L antibodies to neuronal tissue, cancer cell lines, and cells transfected with recombinant CDR2 and CDR2L to elucidate which is the major antigen of Yo antibodies. We found that Yo antibodies bound endogenous CDR2L, but not endogenous CDR2. However, Yo antibodies can bind the recombinant CDR2 protein used in routine clinical testing for these antibodies. Because Yo antibodies only bind endogenous CDR2L, we conclude that CDR2L is the major antigen of Yo antibodies in PCD. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>Many experimental results, both in-vivo and in-vitro, support the idea that
the brain cortex operates near a critical point, and at the same time works as
a reservoir of precise spatio-temporal patterns. However the mechanism at the
basis of these observations is still not clear. In this paper we introduce a
model which combines both these features, showing that scale-free avalanches
are the signature of a system posed near the spinodal line of a first order
transition, with many spatio-temporal patterns stored as dynamical metastable
attractors. Specifically, we studied a network of leaky integrate and fire
neurons, whose connections are the result of the learning of multiple
spatio-temporal dynamical patterns, each with a randomly chosen ordering of the
neurons. We found that the network shows a first order transition between a low
spiking rate disordered state (down), and a high rate state characterized by
the emergence of collective activity and the replay of one of the stored
patterns (up). The transition is characterized by hysteresis, or alternation of
up and down states, depending on the lifetime of the metastable states. In both
cases, critical features and neural avalanches are observed. Notably, critical
phenomena occur at the edge of a discontinuous phase transition, as recently
observed in a network of glow lamps.

Stem cells can stay quiescent for long period of time or proliferate and differentiate into multiple lineages. The activity of stage-specific metabolic programs allows stem cells to best adapt their functions in different microenvironments. Specific cellular phenotypes can be, therefore, defined by precise metabolic signatures. Notably, not only cellular metabolism describes a defined cellular phenotype, but experimental evidences now clearly indicate that also rewiring cells towards a particular cellular metabolism can drive their cellular phenotype and function accordingly. 
Cellular metabolism can be studied by both targeted and untargeted approaches. Targeted analyses focus on a subset of identified metabolites and on their metabolic fluxes. In addition, the overall assessment of the oxygen consumption rate gives a measure of the overall cellular oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function.  Untargeted approach provides a large-scale identification and quantification of the whole metabolome with the aim to describe a metabolic fingerprinting. 
In this review, we overview the methodologies currently available for the study of in vitro stem cell metabolism, including metabolic fluxes, fingerprint analyses, and single cell metabolomics. Moreover, we summarize available approaches for the study of in vivo stem cell metabolism. For all of the described methods, we highlight their specificities and limitations. In addition, we discuss practical concerns about the most threatening steps, including metabolic quenching, sample preparation and extraction. A better knowledge of the precise metabolic signature defining specific cell population is instrumental to the design of novel therapeutic strategies able to drive undifferentiated stem cells towards a selective and valuable cellular phenotype.

Noise trauma causes loss of synaptic connections between cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Such synaptic loss can trigger slow and progressive degeneration of SGNs. Macrophage fractalkine signaling is critical for neuron survival in the injured cochlea, but its role in cochlear synaptopathy is unknown. Fractalkine, a chemokine, is constitutively expressed by SGNs and signals via its receptor CX3CR1 that is expressed on macrophages. The present study characterized the immune response and examined the function of fractalkine signaling in degeneration and repair of cochlear synapses following noise trauma. Adult mice wild type, heterozygous and knockout for CX3CR1 on a C57BL/6 background were exposed for 2 hours to an octave band noise at 90 dB SPL. Noise exposure caused temporary shifts in hearing thresholds without any evident loss of hair cells in CX3CR1 heterozygous mice that have intact fractalkine signaling. Enhanced macrophage migration towards the inner hair cell-synaptic region was observed immediately after exposure in all genotypes. Synaptic immunolabeling revealed a rapid loss of synapses throughout the basal turn of the cochlea of all genotypes. The damaged synapses spontaneously recovered in mice with intact CX3CR1. However, CX3CR1 knockout (KO) animals displayed enhanced synaptic degeneration that correlated with attenuated suprathreshold neural responses at higher frequencies. Exposed CX3CR1 KO mice also exhibited increased loss of IHCs and SGN cell bodies compared to exposed heterozygous mice. These results indicate that macrophages can promote repair of damaged synapses after moderate noise trauma and that repair requires fractalkine signaling.

Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES), which encompasses several techniques with heterogeneous physiological responses, has shown in some cases remarkable outcomes for pain treatment and clinical rehabilitation. However, results are still mixed, mainly because there is a lack of understanding regarding its neural mechanisms of action. In this study, we aimed to assess its effects by measuring cortical activation as indexed by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a functional optical imaging method to evaluate hemodynamic changes in oxygenated (HbO) and de-oxygenated (HbR) blood hemoglobin concentrations in cortical capillary networks that can be related to cortical activity. We hypothesized that non-painful PES of accessory spinal nerve (ASN) can promote cortical activation of sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) pain processing cortical areas. Fifteen healthy volunteers received both active and sham ASN electrical stimulation in a randomized crossover study. The hemodynamic cortical response to unilateral right ASN burst electrical stimulation with 10 Hz was measured by a 40-channel fNIRS system. The effect of ASN electrical stimulation over HbO concentration in cortical areas of interest was observed through the activation of right-DLPFC (p=0.025) and left-SMC (p=0.042) in the active group but not in sham group. Regarding left-DLPFC (p=0.610) and right-SMC (p=0.174) there was no statistical difference between groups. As in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) top-down modulation, bottom-up electrical stimulation to the accessory spinal nerve seems to activate the same critical cortical areas on pain pathways related to sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational pain dimensions. These results provide additional mechanistic evidence to develop and optimize the effects of peripheral neural electrical stimulation. (NCT 03295370 - clinicaltrials.gov).

A comparison of the different types of resting state reveals some interesting characteristics of spontaneous brain activity that cannot be found in a single condition. Differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) between the eyes open (EO) and the eyes closed (EC) almost have a spatially distinct pattern with traditional EO-EC activation within sensory systems, suggesting the divergent functional roles of ALFF and activation. However, the underlying mechanism is far from clear. Since the thalamus plays an essential role in sensory processing, one critical step towards understanding the divergences is to depict the relationships between the thalamus and the ALFF modulation in sensory regions. In this preliminary study, we examined the association between the changes of ALFF and the changes of thalamic functional connectivity (FC) between EO and EC. We focused on two visual thalamic nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the pulvinar (Pu). FC results showed that LGN had stronger synchronization with regions in lateral but not in medial visual networks, while Pu had a weaker synchronization with auditory and sensorimotor areas during EO compared with EC. Moreover, the patterns of FC modulation exhibited considerable overlaps with the ALFF modulation, and there were significant correlations between them across subjects. Our findings support the crucial role of the thalamus in amplitude modulation of low-frequency spontaneous activity in sensory systems, and may pave the way to elucidate the mechanisms governing distinction between evoked activation and modulation of low-frequency spontaneous brain activity.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00190">Modulation of Fronto-Striatal Functional Connectivity Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h4>

Background
The fronto-striatal network is involved in various motor, cognitive and emotional processes, such as spatial attention, working memory, decision-making and emotion regulation. Intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to modulate functional connectivity of brain networks. Long stimulation intervals, as well as high stimulation intensities are typically applied in transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for mood disorders. The role of stimulation intensity on network function and homeostasis has not been explored systematically yet. 
Objective
We aimed to modulate fronto-striatal connectivity by applying iTBS at different intensities to the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured individual and group changes by comparing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) pre-iTBS und post iTBS. Differential effects of individual sub- versus supra-resting motor-threshold stimulation intensities were assessed.
Methods
Sixteen healthy subjects underwent excitatory iTBS at two intensities (90 % and 120 % of individual resting motor threshold) on separate days. 600 pulses (2 s trains, 8 s pauses, duration of 3 minutes, 20 seconds) were applied over the left DLPFC. Directly before and 7 min after stimulation, task-free rsfMRI sessions, lasting 10 min each, were conducted. Individual seed-to-seed functional connectivity changes were calculated for ten fronto-striatal and amygdala regions of interest with the SPM toolbox DPABI.
Results
Sub-threshold-iTBS increased functional connectivity directly between the left DLPFC and the left and right caudate, respectively, as well as between the right DLPFC and the left caudate. Indirectly, functional connectivity between the right putamen and the left nucleus accumbens and the left amygdala, respectively, was increased. 
Supra-threshold stimulation did not change fronto-striatal functional connectivity, but only increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the caudate nuclei, as well as the left putamen, respectively.
Conclusion
A short iTBS protocol applied at sub-threshold intensities was not only sufficient, but favourable in order to increase bilateral fronto-striatal functional connectivity, while minimising side effects. Decreased functional connectivity after supra-threshold stimulation was possibly caused by network homeostatic effects.

It is often assumed that Hebbian synaptic plasticity forms a cell assembly, a mutually interacting group of neurons that encodes memory. However, in recurrently connected networks with pure Hebbian plasticity, cell assemblies typically diverge or fade under ongoing changes of synaptic strength. Previously assumed mechanisms that stabilize cell assemblies do not robustly reproduce the experimentally reported unimodal and long-tailed distribution of synaptic strengths. Here, we show that augmenting Hebbian plasticity with experimentally observed intrinsic spine dynamics can stabilize cell assemblies and reproduce the distribution of synaptic strengths. Moreover, we posit that strong intrinsic spine dynamics impair learning performance. Our theory explains how excessively strong spine dynamics, experimentally observed in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder, impair learning associations in the brain.

Transient potassium current channels (IA channels), which are expressed in most brain areas, have a central role in modulating feedforward and feedback inhibition along the dendroaxonic axis. Loss of the modulatory channels is tightly associated with a number of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, tinnitus, and ataxia. However, the functional significance of IA channels in these diseases has so far been underestimated. In this review, we discuss the distribution and function of IA channels. Particularly, we posit that downregulation of IA channels results in neuronal (mostly dendritic) hyperexcitability accompanied by imbalanced excitation and inhibition ratio in the brain's networks, eventually causing the brain diseases. Finally, we propose a potential therapeutic target: the enhanced action of IA channels to counteract Ca2+-permeable channels including NMDA receptors could be harnessed to restore dendritic excitability, leading to a balanced neuronal state.

The role of neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies focusing on the glial cells involved in the inflammatory responses of the brain, namely microglia and astroglia, have over the years pointed out the dynamic and changing behavior of these cells, accompanied by different morphologies and activation forms. This is particularly evident in diseased conditions, where glia react to any shift from homeostasis, acquiring different phenotypes. Particularly for microglia, it has soon become clear that such phenotypes are multiple, as multiple are the functions related to them. Several approaches have over time revealed different facets of microglial phenotypic diversity, and advanced genetic analyses, in recent years, have added new insights into microglial heterogeneity, opening novel scenarios that researchers have just started to explore. Among neurodegenerative diseases, an important section is represented by alpha-synucleinopathies. Here alpha-synuclein accumulates abnormally in the brain and, depending on its pattern of distribution, leads to the development of different clinical conditions. Also for these proteinopathies, neuroinflammation and glial activation have been identified as constant and crucial factors during disease development. In the present review we will address the current literature about glial phenotypic changes with respect to alpha-synucleinopathies, as well as consider the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of such a dynamic cellular behavior.

Ketamine exposure in the developing brain disturbed normal neurogenesis and resulted in subsequent neurocognitive deficits. 17β-estradiol provides robust neuroprotection in a variety of brain injury models in animals of both sexes and attenuates neurodegeneration induced by anesthesia agents. In the present study, we investigated whether 17β-estradiol could attenuate disturbed neurogenesis and behavioural deficits induced by ketamine exposure in neonatal rats.
Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (PND) 7 and neural stem cells (NSCs) were treated with either normal saline, ketamine, or 17β-estradiol prior/after ketamine exposure, respectively. The rats were decapitated at PND14 for detection of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus by immunostaining. NSC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL, respectively. The protein expressions of caspase-3 in vivo and GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in vitro were assessed by western blotting. Spatial learning and memory abilities were measured by the Morris water maze test at PND 42-47.
Ketamine exposure decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ and SGZ, inhibited NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation, promoted NSC apoptosis and led to late cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ketamine increased caspase-3 expression in vivo and decreased protein expressions of p-GSK-3β in vitro. Treatment with 17β-estradiol attenuated ketamine-elicited changes both in vivo and in vitro.
We for the first time showed that 17β-estradiol alleviated ketamine-induced neurogenesis damage and neurocognitive deficits in developing rat brain. Moreover, the protection of17β-estradiol is associated with the GSK-3β.

Although the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and episodic memories, the mechanisms underlying memory formation, stabilization, and recall for adaptive behavior remain relatively unknown. During exploration, within single cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm that dominates hippocampal local field potentials, place cells form precisely ordered sequences of activity. These neural sequences result from the integration of both external inputs conveying sensory-motor information, and intrinsic network dynamics possibly related to memory processes. Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that these neural sequences play a key role in information processing and support the formation of initial memory traces, and discuss potential functional distinctions between neural sequences emerging during theta versus awake sharp-wave ripples.

The aging retinal pigment epithelium and oxidative stress, mediated by reactive oxygen species accumulation, have been implicated in the mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The expression level of the adapter protein p66shc, a key protein that regulates cellular oxidative stress, is relatively low under normal conditions because of the effects of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) on the binding of fully deacetylated histone H3’ to the p66shc promoter region, thus inhibiting p66shc transcription and expression. The equilibrium between SIRT1 and p66shc is disrupted in the presence of various stresses, including AMD. As a major target gene, SIRT1 is regulated by microRNA-34a (miR-34a), and overexpression of miR-34a results in significant inhibition of post-transcriptional expression of SIRT1. Furthermore, our recent studies demonstrated that miR-34a is significantly upregulated, accompanied by reduced tolerance to oxidative stress in hydrogen peroxide-induced prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, the expression of SIRT1 is decreased, whereas that of p66shc is increased in these cells. Accordingly, miR-34a may play a key role in age-related susceptibility to oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells by targeting the SIRT1/p66shc pathway, leading to AMD. In this review, we discuss the functions of miR-34a in modulating the SIRT1/p66shc pathway in age-related conditions, including AMD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48215">The structure of the yeast Ctf3 complex</a></h4>

Kinetochores are the chromosomal attachment points for spindle microtubules. They are also signaling hubs that control major cell cycle transitions and coordinate chromosome folding. Most well-studied eukaryotes rely on a conserved set of factors, which are divided among two loosely-defined groups, for these functions. Outer kinetochore proteins contact microtubules or regulate this contact directly. Inner kinetochore proteins designate the kinetochore assembly site by recognizing a specialized nucleosome containing the H3 variant Cse4/CENP-A. We previously determined the structure, resolved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of the yeast Ctf19 complex (Ctf19c, homologous to the vertebrate CCAN), providing a high-resolution view of inner kinetochore architecture (Hinshaw and Harrison, 2019). We now extend these observations by reporting a near-atomic model of the Ctf3 complex, the outermost Ctf19c sub-assembly seen in our original cryo-EM density. The model is sufficiently well-determined by the new data to enable molecular interpretation of Ctf3 recruitment and function.

Synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the rate-limiting step in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in land plants. In photosynthetic eukaryotes and many bacteria, glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) is the most tightly controlled enzyme upstream of ALA. Higher plants possess two GluTR species: GluTR1 is predominantly expressed in green tissue, and GluTR2 is constitutively expressed in all organs. Although proposed long time ago, the molecular mechanism of heme-dependent inhibition of GluTR <i>in planta</i> has remained elusive. Here, we report that accumulation of heme, induced by feeding with ALA, stimulates Clp-protease-dependent degradation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> GluTR1. We demonstrate that binding of heme to the GluTR-binding protein (GBP) inhibits interaction of GBP with the N-terminal regulatory domain of GluTR1, thus making it accessible to the Clp protease. The results presented uncover a functional link between heme content and the post-translational control of GluTR stability, which helps to ensure adequate availability of chlorophyll and heme.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45631">Vps8 overexpression inhibits HOPS-dependent trafficking routes by outcompeting Vps41/Lt</a></h4>

Two related multisubunit tethering complexes promote endolysosomal trafficking in all eukaryotes: Rab5-binding CORVET that was suggested to transform into Rab7-binding HOPS. We have previously identified miniCORVET, containing Drosophila Vps8 and three shared core proteins, which is required for endosome maturation upstream of HOPS in highly endocytic cells  (Lorincz et al., 2016a). Here we show that Vps8 overexpression inhibits HOPS-dependent trafficking routes including late endosome maturation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion, crinophagy and lysosome-related organelle formation. Mechanistically, Vps8 overexpression abolishes the late endosomal localization of HOPS-specific Vps41/Lt and prevents HOPS assembly. Proper ratio of Vps8 to Vps41 is thus critical because Vps8 negatively regulates HOPS by outcompeting Vps41. Endosomal recruitment of miniCORVET- or HOPS-specific subunits requires proper complex assembly, and Vps8/miniCORVET is dispensable for autophagy, crinophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. These data together indicate the recruitment of these complexes to target membranes independent of each other in Drosophila, rather than their transformation during vesicle maturation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45545">Sonic hedgehog signaling in astrocytes mediates cell-type-specific synaptic organization</a></h4>

Astrocytes have emerged as integral partners with neurons in regulating synapse formation and function, but the mechanisms that mediate these interactions are not well understood. Here, we show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in mature astrocytes is required for establishing structural organization and remodeling of cortical synapses in a cell type-specific manner. In the postnatal cortex, Shh signaling is active in a subpopulation of mature astrocytes localized primarily in deep cortical layers. Selective disruption of Shh signaling in astrocytes produces a dramatic increase in synapse number specifically on layer V apical dendrites that emerges during adolescence and persists into adulthood. Dynamic turnover of dendritic spines is impaired in mutant mice and is accompanied by an increase in neuronal excitability and a reduction of the glial-specific, inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.1. These data identify a critical role for Shh signaling in astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal activity required for sculpting synapses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44939">The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex computes task-invariant relative subjective value for self and other</a></h4>

Few studies have addressed the neural computations underlying decisions made for others despite the importance of this ubiquitous behavior. Using participant-specific behavioral modeling with univariate and multivariate fMRI approaches, we investigated the neural correlates of decision-making for self and other in two independent tasks, including intertemporal and risky choice. Modeling subjective valuation indicated that participants distinguished between themselves and others with dissimilar preferences. Activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was consistently modulated by relative subjective value. Multi-voxel pattern analysis indicated that activity in the dmPFC uniquely encoded relative subjective value and generalized across self and other and across both tasks. Furthermore, agent cross-decoding accuracy between self and other in the dmPFC was related to self-reported social attitudes. These findings indicate that the dmPFC emerges as a medial prefrontal node that utilizes a task-invariant mechanism for computing relative subjective value for self and other.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39733">Metabolic network percolation quantifies biosynthetic capabilities across the human oral microbiome</a></h4>

The biosynthetic capabilities of microbes underlie their growth and interactions, playing a prominent role in microbial community structure. For large, diverse microbial communities, prediction of these capabilities is limited by uncertainty about metabolic functions and environmental conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic method, inspired by percolation theory, to computationally quantify how robustly a genome-derived metabolic network produces a given set of metabolites under an ensemble of variable environments. We used this method to compile an atlas of predicted biosynthetic capabilities for 97 metabolites across 456 human oral microbes. This atlas captures taxonomically-related trends in biomass composition, and makes it possible to estimate inter-microbial metabolic distances that correlate with microbial co-occurrences. We also found a distinct cluster of fastidious/uncultivated taxa, including several <i>Saccharibacteria</i> (TM7) species, characterized by their abundant metabolic deficiencies. By embracing uncertainty, our approach can be broadly applied to understanding metabolic interactions in complex microbial ecosystems.

The vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) plays an important role in social behaviors including aggression, social learning and memory. Genetic removal of Avpr1b from mouse models results in deficits in aggression and short-term social recognition in adults. Avpr1b gene expression is highly enriched in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 2 (CA2) region. Activity of the hippocampal CA2 has been shown to be required for normal short-term social recognition and aggressive behaviors. Vasopressin acts to enhance synaptic responses of CA2 neurons through a NMDA-receptor dependent mechanism. Genetic removal of the obligatory subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) within distinct hippocampal regions impairs non-social learning and memory. However, the question of a direct role for NMDA receptor activity in Avpr1b neurons to modulate social behavior remains unclear. To answer this question, we first created a novel transgenic mouse line with Cre recombinase knocked into the Avpr1b coding region to genetically target Avpr1b neurons. We confirmed this line has dense Cre expression throughout the dorsal and ventral CA2 regions of the hippocampus, along with scattered expression within the caudate-putamen and olfactory bulb. Conditional removal of the NMDA receptor was achieved by crossing our line to an available floxed Grin1 line. The resulting mice were measured on a battery of social and memory behavioral tests. Surprisingly, we did not observe any differences between Avpr1b-Grin1 knockout mice and their wildtype siblings. We conclude that mice without typical NMDA receptor function in Avpr1b neurons can develop normal aggression as well as short-term social and object memory performance.

The spatiotemporal dynamics of glutamate and gama-aminobutyric acide (GABA) in the synaptic cleft plays a key role in the signal integration in the brain. Since there is no extracellular metabolism of glutamate and GABA, cellular uptake through transporters and diffusion to extracellular space (ECS) regulates the concentration of both neurotransmitters in the cleft. We use the most up to date information about the transporters and synaptic cleft to model the homeostasis of both glutamate and GABA. We show that the models can be used to investigate the role played by different isoforms of transporters, uptake by different neuronal compartments or glia cells, and key parameters determining the morphology of synaptic cleft in the neurotransmitter concentration in the cleft and ECS, and how they shape synaptic responses through postsynaptic receptors. We demonstrate the utility of our models by application to simple neuronal networks and showing that varying the neurotransmitter uptake capacity and synaptic cleft parameters within experimentally observed range can lead to significant changes in neuronal behavior such as the transition of the network between gamma and beta rhythms. The modular form of the models allows easy extension in the future and integration with other computational models of normal and pathological neuronal functions.

Cord blood (CB) mononuclear cells (MNC) are being tested in clinical trials to treat hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injuries. Although early results are encouraging, mechanisms underlying potential clinical benefits are not well understood. To explore these mechanisms further, we exposed mouse brain organotypic slice cultures to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and then treated the brain slices with cells from CB or adult peripheral blood (PB). We found that CB-MNCs protect neurons from OGD-induced death and reduced both microglial and astrocyte activation. PB-MNC failed to affect either outcome. The protective activities were largely mediated by factors secreted by CB-MNC, as direct cell-to-cell contact between the injured brain slices and CB cells was not essential. To determine if a specific subpopulation of CB-MNC are responsible for these protective activities, we depleted CB-MNC of various cell types and found that only removal of CB CD14+ monocytes abolished neuroprotection. We also used positively selected subpopulations of CB-MNC and PB-MNC in this assay and demonstrated that purified CB-CD14+ cells, but not CB-PB CD14+ cells, efficiently protected neuronal cells from death and reduced glial activation following OGD. Gene expression microarray analysis demonstrated that compared to PB-CD14+ monocytes, CB-CD14+ monocytes over-expressed several secreted proteins with potential to protect neurons. Differential expression of five candidate effector molecules, chitinase 3-like protein-1, inhibin-A, interleukin-10, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and thrombospondin-1, were confirmed by western blotting, and immunofluorescence. These findings suggest that CD14+ monocytes are a critical cell-type when treating HI with CB-MNC.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/670661v1?rss=1">Immune, Autonomic, and Endocrine Dysregulation in Autism and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders Versus Unaffected Controls</a></h4>

Background: A growing body of literature suggests etiological overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and some cases of autism, although this relationship is poorly delineated. In addition, immune, autonomic, and endocrine dysregulation are reported in both conditions and may be relevant to their respective etiologies. Aims: To study symptom overlap in these two comorbid spectrum conditions. Methods and Procedures: We surveyed 702 adults aged 25+ years on a variety of EDS/HSD-related health topics, comparing individuals with EDS/HSD, autism, and unaffected controls. Outcomes and Results: The autism group reported similar though less severe symptomology as the EDS/HSD group, especially in areas of immune/autonomic/endocrine dysregulation, connective tissue abnormalities (i.e., skin, bruising/bleeding), and chronic pain. EDS/HSD mothers with autistic children reported more immune symptoms than EDS/HSD mothers without, suggesting the maternal immune system could play a heritable role in these conditions (p = 0.0119). Conclusions and Implications: These data suggest that EDS/HSD and autism share aspects of immune/autonomic/endocrine dysregulation, pain, and some tissue fragility, which is typically more severe in the former. This overlap, as well as documented comorbidity, suggests some forms of autism may be hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTD).

Objective: To objectively quantify how cerebral volume loss could assist with clinical diagnosis and clinical trial design in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Methods: We applied deformation-based morphometric analyses with robust registration to precisely quantify the magnitude and pattern of atrophy in patients with bvFTD as compared to cognitively normal controls (CNCs), to assess the progression of atrophy over one year follow up and to generate clinical trial sample size estimates to detect differences for the structures most sensitive to change. This study included 203 subjects - 70 bvFTD and 133 CNCs - with a total of 482 timepoints from the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative. Results: Deformation based morphometry (DBM) revealed significant atrophy in the frontal lobes, insula, medial and anterior temporal regions bilaterally in bvFTD subjects compared to controls with outstanding subcortical involvement. We provide detailed information on regional changes per year. In both cross-sectional analysis and over a one-year follow-up period, ventricle expansion was the most prominent differentiator of bvFTD from controls and a sensitive marker of disease progression. Conclusions: Automated measurement of ventricular expansion is a sensitive and reliable marker of disease progression in bvFTD to be used in clinical trials for potential disease modifying drugs, as well as possibly to implement in clinical practice. Ventricular expansion measured with DBM provides the lowest published estimated sample size for clinical trial design to detect significant differences over one and two years.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/670620v1?rss=1">Tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels mediate action potential firing and excitability in menthol-sensitive Vglut3-lineage sensory neurons</a></h4>

Small-diameter vesicular glutamate transporter 3-lineage (Vglut3lineage) dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play an important role in mechanosensation and thermal hypersensitivity; however, little is known about their intrinsic electrical properties. We therefore set out to investigate mechanisms of excitability within this population. Calcium microfluorimetry analysis of male and female mouse DRG neurons demonstrated that the cooling compound menthol selectively activates a subset of Vglut3lineage neurons. Whole-cell recordings showed that small-diameter Vglut3lineage DRG neurons fire menthol-evoked action potentials and exhibited robust, transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)-dependent discharges at room temperature. This heightened excitability was confirmed by current-clamp and action potential phase-plot analyses, which showed menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons to have more depolarized membrane potentials, lower firing thresholds, and higher evoked firing frequencies compared with menthol-insensitive Vglut3lineage neurons. A biophysical analysis revealed voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) currents in menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons were resistant to entry into slow inactivation compared with menthol-insensitive neurons. Multiplex in situ hybridization showed similar distributions of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive NaVs transcripts between TRPM8-positive and -negative Vglut3lineageneurons; however, NaV1.8 transcripts, which encode TTX-resistant channels, were more prevalent in TRPM8-negative neurons. Conversely, pharmacological analyses identified distinct functional contributions of NaV subunits, with NaV1.1 driving firing in menthol-sensitive neurons, whereas other small-diameter Vglut3lineageneurons rely primarily on TTX-resistant NaV channels. Additionally, when NaV1.1 channels were blocked, the remaining NaV currents readily entered into slow inactivation in menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons. Thus, these data demonstrate that TTX-sensitive NaVs drive action potential firing in menthol-sensitive sensory neurons and contribute to their heightened excitability.

Converging evidence indicates that each nominally distinct psychiatric disease entity have both broadly shared and distinct risk genes, clinical symptoms, and brain structural and functional disruption. Many studies used the static (time-averaged) functional connectivity to examine the similarities and differences in functional brain networks in psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the similarities and differences in dynamic functional connectivity (FC) networks across multiple major psychiatric disorders. A total of 655 participants (125 with schizophrenia (SZ), 121 with bipolar disorder (BD), 192 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 217 demographically matched healthy controls (HC) completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at a single site. We used sliding-window approach to construct dynamic FC networks, and used k-means clustering to obtain four dissociated networks by different states. We identified shared and distinct dysconnectivity across these psychiatric disorders compared with HC in each state. We found dysconnectivity in psychosis were state-specific, rather than a time-invariant global abnormality. SZ, BD and MDD shared decreased intra-network FC (especially frontoparietal control network (FPN)), whereas increased inter-network FC (especially between visual network (VN) and both default mode network (DMN) and FPN). Almost all dysconnectivity in BD and MDD were included in those in SZ, with SZ had distinct dysconnectivity that preferentially involving inter-network dysconnectivity between high-level cognitive networks. Many dysconnectivity were not detected by static FC. These findings shed new light on the current transdiagnostic knowledge, and advocate future researches use dynamic methods to study psychiatric disorders, besides use static methods.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/670489v1?rss=1">Familiarity increases processing speed in the visual system</a></h4>

Familiarity with a stimulus leads to an attenuated neural response to the stimulus. Alongside this attenuation, recent studies have also observed a truncation of stimulus-evoked activity for familiar visual input. One proposed function of this truncation is to rapidly put neurons in a state of readiness to respond to new input. Here, we examined this hypothesis by presenting human participants with target stimuli that were embedded in rapid streams of familiar or novel distractor stimuli at different speeds of presentation, while recording brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and measuring behavioral performance. We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of signal truncation and whether this phenomenon bears relationship to participants' ability to categorize target items within a visual stream. Behaviorally, target categorization performance was markedly better when the target was embedded within familiar distractors, and this benefit became more pronounced with increasing speed of presentation. Familiar distractors showed a truncation of neural activity in the visual system, and this truncation was strongest for the fastest presentation speeds. Moreover, neural processing of the target was stronger when it was preceded by familiar distractors. Taken together, these findings suggest that truncation of neural responses for familiar items may result in stronger processing of relevant target information, resulting in superior perceptual performance.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/670091v1?rss=1">Stimulation augments spike sequence replay and memory consolidation during slow-wave sleep</a></h4>

Newly acquired memory traces are spontaneously reactivated during slow-wave sleep (SWS), leading to the consolidation of recent memories. Empirical studies found that sensory stimulation during SWS selectively enhances memory consolidation and the effect depends on the phase of stimulation. In this new study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the role of sensory stimulation on memory consolidation using computational models implementing effects of neuromodulators to simulate transitions between awake and SWS sleep, and synaptic plasticity to allow the change of synaptic connections due to the training in awake or replay during sleep. We found that when closed-loop stimulation was applied during the Down states (900-2700) of sleep slow oscillation, particularly right before transition from Down to Up state, it significantly affected the spatio-temporal pattern of the slow-waves and maximized memory replay. In contrast, when the stimulation was presented during the Up states (2700-3600 and 00-900), it did not have a significant impact on the slow-waves or memory performance after sleep. For multiple memories trained in awake, presenting stimulation cues associated with specific memory trace could selectively augment replay and enhance consolidation of that memory and interfere with consolidation of the others (particularly weak) memories. Our study proposes a synaptic level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/670018v1?rss=1">Kv4.1, a key ion channel for low frequency firing of dentate granule cells, is crucial for pattern separation</a></h4>

The dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus may play key roles in remembering distinct episodes through pattern separation, which may be subserved by the sparse firing properties of granule cells (GCs) in the DG. Low intrinsic excitability is characteristic of mature GCs, but ion channel mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated ionic channel mechanisms for firing frequency regulation in GCs of the rat hippocampus, and identified Kv4.1 as a key player. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Kv4.1 was preferentially expressed in the DG, and its expression level was higher at 8-week than 3-week-old mice, suggesting a developmental regulation of Kv4.1 expression. With respect to firing frequency, GCs are categorized into two distinctive groups: low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) firing GCs. Input resistance (Rin) of most LF-GCs is lower than 200 M{Omega}, suggesting that LF-GCs are fully mature GCs. Kv4.1 channel inhibition by intracellular perfusion of Kv4.1 antibody increased firing rates and gain of the input-output relationship selectively in LF-GCs with no significant effect on resting membrane potential and Rin, but had no effect in HF-GCs. Importantly, mature GCs from mice depleted of Kv4.1 transcripts in the DG showed increased firing frequency, and these mice showed an impairment in contextual discrimination task. Our findings suggest that Kv4.1 expression occurring at late stage of GC maturation is essential for low excitability of DG networks and thereby contributes to pattern separation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/669887v1?rss=1">Machine learning identifies large-scale reward-related activity modulated by dopaminergic enhancement in major depression</a></h4>

Background: Theoretical models have emphasized systems-level abnormalities in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). For unbiased yet rigorous evaluations of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MDD, it is critically important to develop data-driven approaches that harness whole-brain data to classify MDD and evaluate possible normalizing effects of targeted interventions. Here, using an experimental therapeutics approach coupled with machine-learning we investigated the effect of a pharmacological challenge aiming to enhance dopaminergic signaling on whole-brain's response to reward-related stimuli in MDD. Methods: Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 31 unmedicated MDD participants receiving a single dose of 50 mg amisulpride (MDDAmisulpride), 26 MDD participants receiving placebo (MDDPlacebo), and 28 healthy controls receiving placebo (HCPlacebo) were analyzed. An importance-guided machine learning technique for model selection was used on whole-brain fMRI data probing reward anticipation and consumption to identify features linked to MDD (MDDPlacebo vs. HCPlacebo) and dopaminergic enhancement (MDDAmisulpride vs. MDDPlacebo). Results: Highly predictive classification models emerged that distinguished MDDPlacebo from HCPlacebo (AUC=0.87) and MDDPlacebo from MDDAmisulpride (AUC=0.89). Although reward-related striatal activation and connectivity were among the most predictive features, the best truncated models based on whole-brain features were significantly better relative to models trained using striatal features only. Conclusions: Results indicate that, in MDD, enhanced dopaminergic signaling restores abnormal activation and connectivity in a widespread network of regions. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of MDD and pharmacological mechanism of antidepressants at the system level in addressing reward processing deficits among depressed individuals.

Naturally occurring alterations in estradiol inuence food intake in females. However, how motivational responses to food cues are affected by the estrous cycle or ovarian hormones is unknown. In addition, while individual susceptibility to obesity is accompanied by enhanced incentive motivational responses to food cues and increased NAc intrinsic excitability in males, studies in females are absent. Here, we examined basal differences in intrinsic NAc excitability of obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant females and determined how conditioned approach (a measure of cue-triggered motivation), food intake, and motivation for food vary with the cycle in naturally cycling female obesity-prone, obesity-resistant, and outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. Finally, we used ovariectomy followed by hormone treatment to determine the role of ovarian hormones in cue-triggered motivation in selectively-bred and outbred female rats. We found that intrinsic excitability of NAc MSNs and conditioned approach are enhanced in female obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant rats. These effects were driven by greater MSN excitability and conditioned approach behavior during metestrus/diestrus vs. proestrus/estrus in obesity-prone but not obesity-resistant rats, despite similar regulation of food intake and food motivation by the cycle in these groups. Furthermore, estradiol and progesterone treatment reduced conditioned approach behavior in obesity-prone and outbred Sprague-Dawley females. To our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate cycle- and hormone-dependent effects on the motivational response to a food cue, and the only studies to date to determine how individual susceptibility to obesity inuences NAc excitability, cue-triggered food-seeking, and differences in the regulation of these neurobehavioral responses by the cycle.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons degenerate resulting in muscle atrophy, paralysis and fatality. Studies using mouse models of ALS indicate a protracted period of disease development with progressive motor neuron pathology, evident as early as embryonic and postnatal stages. Key missing information includes concomitant alterations in the sensorimotor circuit essential for normal development and function of the neuromuscular system. Leveraging unique brainstem circuitry, we show in vitro evidence for reflex circuit-specific postnatal abnormalities in the jaw proprioceptive sensory neurons in the well-studied SOD1G93A mouse. These include impaired and arrhythmic action potential burst discharge associated with a deficit in Nav1.6 Na+ channels. However, the mechanoreceptive and nociceptive trigeminal ganglion neurons and the visual sensory retinal ganglion neurons were resistant to excitability changes in age matched SOD1G93A mice. Computational modeling of the observed disruption in sensory patterns predicted asynchronous self-sustained motor neuron discharge suggestive of imminent reflexive defects such as muscle fasciculations in ALS. These results demonstrate a novel reflex circuit-specific proprioceptive sensory abnormality in ALS.

Abstract<p>Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions – behavioral control, declarative memory – have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process – a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event – is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational <i>operation</i> (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of <i>representational content</i> (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Accounts of cognition often assume that the brain is organized along lines of cognitive process, for example, with recollection mediated by one neural structure and familiarity by another. We argue that cognitive processes – introspectively-identifiable mental events like recollection – are inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms, because they conflate lower-level components of the mechanisms we seek to identify. Recollection involves both a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion) and a neural representation (high-dimensional, associative content). To uncover memory's mechanisms, we must decompose memory processes into their operations and representations, asking how each contributes to mnemonic phenomena. Decomposing recollection suggests that, within the ventral visual pathway and MTL, different brain regions contribute to memory retrieval according to their representational content.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/24/4829?rss=1">Spontaneous Recurrent Absence Seizure-like Events in Wild-Caught Rats</a></h4>

<p>Absence epilepsy is a heritable human neurological disorder characterized by brief nonconvulsive seizures with behavioral arrest, moderate-to-severe loss of consciousness (absence), and distinct spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Genetic models of this disorder have been created by selectively inbreeding rats for absence seizure-like events with similar electrical and behavioral characteristics. However, these events are also common in outbred laboratory rats, raising concerns about whether SWD/immobility accurately reflects absence epilepsy as opposed to "normal" rodent behavior. We hypothesized that, if SWD/immobility models absence seizures, it would not exist in wild-caught rats due to the pressures of natural selection. To test this hypothesis, we compared chronic video/electrocorticogram recordings from male and female wild-caught (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats to recordings from laboratory outbred BN, outbred Long–Evans, and inbred WAG/Rij rats (i.e., a model of absence epilepsy). Wild-caught BN rats displayed absence-like SWD/immobility events that were highly similar to outbred BN rats in terms of spike-wave morphology, frequency, diurnal rhythmicity, associated immobility, and sensitivity to the anti-absence drug, ethosuximide; however, SWD bursts were less frequent and of shorter duration in wild-caught and outbred BN rats than the outbred Long–Evans and inbred WAG/Rij strains. We conclude that SWD/immobility in rats does not represent absence seizures, although they appear to have many similarities. In wild rats, SWD/immobility appears to represent normal brain activity that does not reduce survival in natural environments, a conclusion that logically extends to outbred laboratory rats and possibly to those that have been inbred to model absence epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spike-wave discharges (SWDs), behavioral arrest, and diminished consciousness are cardinal signs of seizures in human absence epilepsy and are used to model this disorder in inbred rats. These characteristics, however, are routinely found in outbred laboratory rats, leading to debate on whether SWD/immobility is a valid model of absence seizures. The SWD/immobility events in wild-caught rats appear equivalent to those found in outbred and inbred rat strains, except for lower incidence and shorter durations. Our results indicate that the electrophysiological and behavioral characteristics of events underlying hypothetical absence epilepsy in rodent models are found in wild rats captured in their natural environment. Other criteria beyond observation of SWDs and associated immobility are required to objectively establish absence epilepsy in rat models.</p>

<p>Pathogenic mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<i>CDKL5</i>) result in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a rare disease marked by early-life seizures, autistic behaviors, and intellectual disability. Although mouse models of CDD exhibit dendritic instability and alterations in synaptic scaffolding proteins, studies of glutamate receptor levels and function are limited. Here we used a novel mouse model of CDD, the <i>Cdkl5<sup>R59X</sup></i> knock-in mouse (R59X), to investigate changes in synaptic glutamate receptor subunits and functional consequences. Male mice were used for all experiments to avoid the confounding effects of X-inactivation that would be present in female heterozygous mice. We showed that adult male R59X mice recapitulated the behavioral outcomes observed in other mouse models of CDD, including social deficits and memory and learning impairments, and exhibited decreased latency to seizure upon pentylenetetrazol administration. Furthermore, we observed a specific increase in GluA2-lacking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the adult R59X hippocampus, which is accompanied electrophysiologically by increased rectification ratio of AMPAR EPSCs and elevated early-phase long term potentiation (LTP). Finally, we showed that acute treatment with the GluA2-lacking AMPAR blocker IEM-1460 decreased AMPAR currents, and rescued social deficits, working memory impairments, and seizure behavior latency in R59X mice.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare disease marked by autistic-like behaviors, intellectual disability, and seizures. While synaptic dysfunction has been observed in mouse models of CDD, there is limited information on how synaptic alterations contribute to behavioral and functional changes in CDD. Here we reveal elevated hippocampal GluA2-lacking AMPAR expression in a novel mouse model of CDD that is accompanied by changes in synaptic AMPAR function and plasticity. We also show, for the first time, that acutely targeting GluA2-lacking AMPAR dysregulation rescues core synaptic and neurobehavioral deficits in CDD.</p>

<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, including environmental sounds. We compared the auditory brainstem response (ABR) recorded <i>in vivo</i> in mice lacking the gene (<i>Fmr1</i><sup>–/<i>y</i></sup>) for fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) with that in wild-type animals. We found that ABR wave I, which represents input from the auditory nerve, is reduced in <i>Fmr1</i><sup>–/<i>y</i></sup> animals, but only at high sound levels. In contrast, wave IV, which represents the activity of auditory brainstem nuclei is enhanced at all sound levels, suggesting that loss of FMRP alters the central processing of auditory signals. Current-clamp recordings of neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in the auditory brainstem revealed that, in contrast to neurons from wild-type animals, sustained depolarization triggers repetitive firing rather than a single action potential. In voltage-clamp recordings, K<sup>+</sup> currents that activate at positive potentials ("high-threshold" K<sup>+</sup> currents), which are required for high-frequency firing and are carried primarily by Kv3.1 channels, are elevated in <i>Fmr1</i><sup>–/<i>y</i></sup> mice, while K<sup>+</sup> currents that activate near the resting potential and inhibit repetitive firing are reduced. We therefore tested the effects of AUT2 [((4-({5-[(4R)-4-ethyl-2,5-dioxo-1-imidazolidinyl]-2-pyridinyl}oxy)-2-(1-methylethyl) benzonitrile], a compound that modulates Kv3.1 channels. AUT2 reduced the high-threshold K<sup>+</sup> current and increased the low-threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents in neurons from <i>Fmr1</i><sup>–/<i>y</i></sup> animals by shifting the activation of the high-threshold current to more negative potentials. This reduced the firing rate and, <i>in vivo</i>, restored wave IV of the ABR. Our results from animals of both sexes suggest that the modulation of the Kv3.1 channel may have potential for the treatment of sensory hypersensitivity in patients with FXS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> mRNA encoding the Kv3.1 potassium channel was one of the first described targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Fragile X syndrome is caused by loss of FMRP and, in humans and mice, causes hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli. We found that components of the auditory brain response (ABR) corresponding to auditory brainstem activity are enhanced in mice lacking FMRP. This is accompanied by hyperexcitability and altered potassium currents in auditory brainstem neurons. Treatment with a drug that alters the voltage dependence of Kv3.1 channels normalizes the imbalance of potassium currents, as well as ABR responses <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that such compounds may be effective in treating some symptoms of fragile X syndrome.</p>

<p>Understanding the neurobiological processes that incite drug craving and drive relapse has the potential to help target efforts to treat addiction. The NAc serves as a critical substrate for reward and motivated behavior, in part due to alterations in excitatory synaptic strength within cortical-accumbens pathways. The present studies investigated a causal link between cocaine-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference and rapid reductions of cocaine-dependent increases in NAc shell synaptic strength in male mice. Cocaine-conditioned place preference behavior and <i>ex vivo</i> whole-cell electrophysiology showed that cocaine-primed reinstatement and synaptic depotentiation were disrupted by inhibiting AMPAR internalization via intra-NAc shell infusion of a Tat-GluA2<sub>3Y</sub> peptide. Furthermore, reinstatement was driven by an mGluR5-dependent reduction in AMPAR signaling. Intra-NAc shell infusion of the mGluR5 antagonist MTEP blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement and corresponding depotentiation, whereas infusion of the mGluR5 agonist CHPG itself promoted reinstatement and depotentiated synaptic strength in the NAc shell. Optogenetic examination of circuit-specific plasticity showed that inhibition of infralimbic cortical input to the NAc shell blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement, whereas low-frequency stimulation (10 Hz) of this pathway in the absence of cocaine triggered a reduction in synaptic strength akin to that observed with cocaine, and was sufficient to promote reinstatement in the absence of a cocaine challenge. These data support a model in which mGluR5-mediated reduction in GluA2-containing AMPARs at NAc shell synapses receiving input from the infralimbic cortex is a critical factor in triggering reinstatement of cocaine-primed conditioned approach behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> These studies identified a sequence of neural events whereby reexposure to cocaine activates a signaling cascade that alters synaptic strength in the NAc shell and triggers a behavioral response driven by a drug-associated memory.</p>

<p>Affective experiences are central not only to our waking life but also to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreams. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17 human participants (7 men) who spent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5 min after the onset of every REM stage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8–13 Hz) and corresponding FAA were calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed that FAA during REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i.e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We experience emotions not only during wakefulness but also during dreaming. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream emotions. Here we used electroencephalography to explore how frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA)—the relative difference in alpha power between the right and left frontal cortical areas that is associated with emotional processing and emotion regulation in wakefulness—is related to dream emotions. We show that individuals with greater FAA (i.e., greater right-sided alpha power) during rapid eye movement sleep, and during evening wakefulness, experience more anger in dreams. FAA may thus reflect the ability to regulate emotions not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.</p>

<p>The distinct visual sensations of shape and texture have been studied separately in cortex; therefore, it remains unknown whether separate neuronal populations encode each of these properties or one population carries a joint encoding. We directly compared shape and texture selectivity of individual V4 neurons in awake macaques (1 male, 1 female) and found that V4 neurons lie along a continuum from strong tuning for boundary curvature of shapes to strong tuning for perceptual dimensions of texture. Among neurons tuned to both attributes, tuning for shape and texture were largely separable, with the latter delayed by ~30 ms. We also found that shape stimuli typically evoked stronger, more selective responses than did texture patches, regardless of whether the latter were contained within or extended beyond the receptive field. These results suggest that there are separate specializations in mid-level cortical processing for visual attributes of shape and texture.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Object recognition depends on our ability to see both the shape of the boundaries of objects and properties of their surfaces. However, neuroscientists have never before examined how shape and texture are linked together in mid-level visual cortex. In this study, we used systematically designed sets of simple shapes and texture patches to probe the responses of individual neurons in the primate visual cortex. Our results provide the first evidence that some cortical neurons specialize in processing shape whereas others specialize in processing textures. Most neurons lie between the ends of this continuum, and in these neurons we find that shape and texture encoding are largely independent.</p>

<p>What information single neurons receive about general neural circuit activity is a fundamental question for neuroscience. Somatic membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>) fluctuations are driven by the convergence of synaptic inputs from a diverse cross-section of upstream neurons. Furthermore, neural activity is often scale-free, implying that some measurements should be the same, whether taken at large or small scales. Together, convergence and scale-freeness support the hypothesis that single <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> recordings carry useful information about high-dimensional cortical activity. Conveniently, the theory of "critical branching networks" (one purported explanation for scale-freeness) provides testable predictions about scale-free measurements that are readily applied to <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> fluctuations. To investigate, we obtained whole-cell current-clamp recordings of pyramidal neurons in visual cortex of turtles with unknown genders. We isolated fluctuations in <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> below the firing threshold and analyzed them by adapting the definition of "neuronal avalanches" (i.e., spurts of population spiking). The <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> fluctuations which we analyzed were scale-free and consistent with critical branching. These findings recapitulated results from large-scale cortical population data obtained separately in complementary experiments using microelectrode arrays described previously (Shew et al., 2015). Simultaneously recorded single-unit local field potential did not provide a good match, demonstrating the specific utility of <i>V</i><sub>m</sub>. Modeling shows that estimation of dynamical network properties from neuronal inputs is most accurate when networks are structured as critical branching networks. In conclusion, these findings extend evidence of critical phenomena while also establishing subthreshold pyramidal neuron <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> fluctuations as an informative gauge of high-dimensional cortical population activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The relationship between membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>) dynamics of single neurons and population dynamics is indispensable to understanding cortical circuits. Just as important to the biophysics of computation are emergent properties such as scale-freeness, where critical branching networks offer insight. This report makes progress on both fronts by comparing statistics from single-neuron whole-cell recordings with population statistics obtained with microelectrode arrays. Not only are fluctuations of somatic <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> scale-free, they match fluctuations of population activity. Thus, our results demonstrate appropriation of the brain's own subsampling method (convergence of synaptic inputs) while extending the range of fundamental evidence for critical phenomena in neural systems from the previously observed mesoscale (fMRI, LFP, population spiking) to the microscale, namely, <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> fluctuations.</p>

<p>The main excitatory inputs to the striatum arising from the cortex and the thalamus innervate both striatal spiny projection neurons and interneurons. These glutamatergic inputs to striatal GABAergic interneurons have been suggested to regulate the spike timing of striatal projection neurons via feedforward inhibition. Understanding how different excitatory inputs are integrated within the striatal circuitry and how they regulate striatal output is crucial for understanding basal ganglia function and related behaviors. Here, using VGLUT2 mice from both sexes, we report the existence of a glutamatergic projection from the mesencephalic locomotor region to the striatum that avoids the spiny neurons and selectively innervates interneurons. Specifically, optogenetic activation of glutamatergic axons from the pedunculopontine nucleus induced monosynaptic excitation in most recorded striatal cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Optogenetic stimulation in awake head-fixed mice consistently induced an increase in the firing rate of putative cholinergic interneurons and fast-spiking interneurons. In contrast, this stimulation did not induce excitatory responses in spiny neurons but rather disynaptic inhibitory responses <i>ex vivo</i> and a decrease in their firing rate <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting a feedforward mechanism mediating the inhibition of spiny projection neurons through the selective activation of striatal interneurons. Furthermore, unilateral stimulation of pedunculopontine nucleus glutamatergic axons in the striatum induced ipsilateral head rotations consistent with the inhibition of striatal output neurons. Our results demonstrate the existence of a unique interneuron-specific midbrain glutamatergic input to the striatum that exclusively recruits feedforward inhibition mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Glutamatergic inputs to the striatum have been shown to target both striatal projection neurons and interneurons and have been proposed to regulate spike timing of the projection neurons in part through feedforward inhibition. Here, we reveal the existence of a midbrain source of glutamatergic innervation to the striatum, originating in the pedunculopontine nucleus. Remarkably, this novel input selectively targets striatal interneurons, avoiding the projection neurons. Furthermore, we show that this selective innervation of interneurons can regulate the firing of the spiny projection neurons and inhibit the striatal output via feedforward inhibition. Together, our results describe a unique source of excitatory innervation to the striatum which selectively recruits feedforward inhibition of spiny neurons without any accompanying excitation.</p>

<p>In response to cortical stroke and unilateral corticospinal tract degeneration, compensatory sprouting of spared corticospinal fibers is associated with recovery of skilled movement in rodents. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms orchestrating this spontaneous rewiring. In this study, we provide insights into the molecular changes in the spinal cord tissue after large ischemic cortical injury in adult female mice, with a focus on factors that might influence the reinnervation process by contralesional corticospinal neurons. We mapped the area of cervical gray matter reinnervation by sprouting contralesional corticospinal axons after unilateral photothrombotic stroke of the motor cortex in mice using anterograde tracing. The mRNA profile of this reinnervation area was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes at selected time points during the recovery process. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two phases of processes: early after stroke (4–7 d post-injury), the spinal transcriptome is characterized by inflammatory processes, including phagocytic processes as well as complement cascade activation. Microglia are specifically activated in the denervated corticospinal projection fields in this early phase. In a later phase (28–42 d post-injury), biological processes include tissue repair pathways with upregulated genes related to neurite outgrowth. Thus, the stroke-denervated spinal gray matter, in particular its intermediate laminae, represents a growth-promoting environment for sprouting corticospinal fibers originating from the contralesional motor cortex. This dataset provides a solid starting point for future studies addressing key elements of the post-stroke recovery process, with the goal to improve neuroregenerative treatment options for stroke patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that the molecular changes in the spinal cord target tissue of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract are mainly defined by two phases: an early inflammatory phase during which microglia are specifically activated in the target area of reinnervating corticospinal motor neurons; and a late phase during which growth-promoting factors are upregulated which can influence the sprouting response, arborization, and synapse formation. By defining for the first time the endogenous molecular machinery in the stroke-denervated cervical spinal gray matter with a focus on promotors of axon growth through the growth-inhibitory adult CNS, this study will serve as a basis to address novel neuroregenerative treatment options for chronic stroke patients.</p>

<p>Adult zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, regenerate neurons in their brain, but the extent and variability of this capacity is unclear.

Genetic lineage tracing shows that specific diencephalic ependymo-radial glial (ERG) progenitor cells give rise to new dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH<sup>+</sup>)] neurons. Ablation elicits an immune response, increased proliferation of ERG progenitor cells, and increased addition of new TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in populations that constitutively add new neurons (e.g., diencephalic population 5/6). Inhibiting the immune response attenuates neurogenesis to control levels. Boosting the immune response enhances ERG proliferation, but not addition of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, in populations in which constitutive neurogenesis is undetectable (e.g., the posterior tuberculum and locus ceruleus), cell replacement and tissue integration are incomplete and transient. This is associated with a loss of spinal TH<sup>+</sup> axons, as well as permanent deficits in shoaling and reproductive behavior. Hence, dopaminergic neuron populations in the adult zebrafish brain show vast differences in regenerative capacity that correlate with constitutive addition of neurons and depend on immune system activation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the fact that zebrafish show a high propensity to regenerate neurons in the brain, this study reveals that not all types of dopaminergic neurons are functionally regenerated after specific ablation. Hence, in the same adult vertebrate brain, mechanisms of successful and incomplete regeneration can be studied. We identify progenitor cells for dopaminergic neurons and show that activating the immune system promotes the proliferation of these cells. However, in some areas of the brain this only leads to insufficient replacement of functionally important dopaminergic neurons that later disappear. Understanding the mechanisms of regeneration in zebrafish may inform interventions targeting the regeneration of functionally important neurons, such as dopaminergic neurons, from endogenous progenitor cells in nonregenerating mammals.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/24/4684?rss=1">Reorganization of Recurrent Layer 5 Corticospinal Networks Following Adult Motor Training</a></h4>

<p>Recurrent synaptic connections between neighboring neurons are a key feature of mammalian cortex, accounting for the vast majority of cortical inputs. Although computational models indicate that reorganization of recurrent connectivity is a primary driver of experience-dependent cortical tuning, the true biological features of recurrent network plasticity are not well identified. Indeed, whether rewiring of connections between cortical neurons occurs during behavioral training, as is widely predicted, remains unknown. Here, we probe M1 recurrent circuits following motor training in adult male rats and find robust synaptic reorganization among functionally related layer 5 neurons, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in recurrent connection probability. This reorganization is specific to the neuronal subpopulation most relevant for executing the trained motor skill, and behavioral performance was impaired following targeted molecular inhibition of this subpopulation. In contrast, recurrent connectivity is unaffected among neighboring layer 5 neurons largely unrelated to the trained behavior. Training-related corticospinal cells also express increased excitability following training. These findings establish the presence of selective modifications in recurrent cortical networks in adulthood following training.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recurrent synaptic connections between neighboring neurons are characteristic of cortical architecture, and modifications to these circuits are thought to underlie in part learning in the adult brain. We now show that there are robust changes in recurrent connections in the rat motor cortex upon training on a novel motor task. Motor training results in a 2.5-fold increase in recurrent connectivity, but only within the neuronal subpopulation most relevant for executing the new motor behavior; recurrent connectivity is unaffected among adjoining neurons that do not execute the trained behavior. These findings demonstrate selective reorganization of recurrent synaptic connections in the adult neocortex following novel motor experience, and illuminate fundamental properties of cortical function and plasticity.</p>

<p>Sex differences in behavior allow animals to effectively mate and reproduce. However, the mechanism by which biological sex regulates behavioral states, which underlie the regulation of sex-shared behaviors, such as locomotion, is largely unknown. In this study, we studied sex differences in the behavioral states of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and found that males spend less time in a low locomotor activity state than hermaphrodites and that dopamine generates this sex difference. In males, dopamine reduces the low activity state by acting in the same pathway as polycystic kidney disease-related genes that function in male-specific neurons. In hermaphrodites, dopamine increases the low activity state by suppression of octopamine signaling in the sex-shared SIA neurons, which have reduced responsiveness to octopamine in males. Furthermore, dopamine promotes exploration both inside and outside of bacterial lawn (the food source) in males and suppresses it in hermaphrodites. These results demonstrate that sexually dimorphic signaling allows the same neuromodulator to promote adaptive behavior for each sex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mechanisms that generate sex differences in sex-shared behaviors, including locomotion, are not well understood. We show that there are sex differences in the regulation of behavioral states in the model animal <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Dopamine promotes the high locomotor activity state in males, which must search for mates to reproduce, and suppresses it in self-fertilizing hermaphrodites through distinct molecular mechanisms. This study demonstrates that sex-specific signaling generates sex differences in the regulation of behavioral states, which in turn modulates the locomotor activity to suit reproduction for each sex.</p>

<p>The circadian transcription factor neuronal PAS domain 2 (NPAS2) is linked to psychiatric disorders associated with altered reward sensitivity. The expression of <i>Npas2</i> is preferentially enriched in the mammalian forebrain, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major neural substrate of motivated and reward behavior. Previously, we demonstrated that downregulation of NPAS2 in the NAc reduces the conditioned behavioral response to cocaine in mice. We also showed that <i>Npas2</i> is preferentially enriched in dopamine receptor 1 containing medium spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) of the striatum. To extend these studies, we investigated the impact of NPAS2 disruption on accumbal excitatory synaptic transmission and strength, along with the behavioral sensitivity to cocaine reward in a cell-type-specific manner. Viral-mediated knockdown of <i>Npas2</i> in the NAc of male and female C57BL/6J mice increased the excitatory drive onto MSNs. Using <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato mice in combination with viral knockdown, we determined these synaptic adaptations were specific to D1R-MSNs relative to non-D1R-MSNs. Interestingly, NAc-specific knockdown of <i>Npas2</i> blocked cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic strength and glutamatergic transmission specifically onto D1R-MSNs. Last, we designed, validated, and used a novel Cre-inducible short-hairpin RNA virus for MSN-subtype-specific knockdown of <i>Npas2</i>. Cell-type-specific <i>Npas2</i> knockdown in D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, in the NAc reduced cocaine conditioned place preference. Together, our results demonstrate that NPAS2 regulates excitatory synapses of D1R-MSNs in the NAc and cocaine reward-related behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Drug addiction is a widespread public health concern often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Disruptions of the circadian clock can predispose or exacerbate substance abuse in vulnerable individuals. We demonstrate a role for the core circadian protein, NPAS2, in mediating glutamatergic neurotransmission at medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region critical for reward processing. We find that NPAS2 negatively regulates functional excitatory synaptic plasticity in the NAc and is necessary for cocaine-induced plastic changes in MSNs expressing the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). We further demonstrate disruption of NPAS2 in D1R-MSNs produces augmented cocaine preference. These findings highlight the significance of cell-type-specificity in mechanisms underlying reward regulation by NPAS2 and extend our knowledge of its function.</p>

<p>In addition to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurons heavily rely on mitochondrial function, and deficits in brain energy metabolism are detected early in AD; however, direct human genetic evidence for mitochondrial involvement in AD pathogenesis is limited. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing data of 4549 AD cases and 3332 age-matched controls and discovered that rare protein altering variants in the gene pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 1 (<i>PTCD1</i>) show a trend for enrichment in cases compared with controls. We show here that PTCD1 is required for normal mitochondrial rRNA levels, proper assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome and hence for mitochondrial translation and assembly of the electron transport chain. Loss of PTCD1 function impairs oxidative phosphorylation and forces cells to rely on glycolysis for energy production. Cells expressing the AD-linked variant of PTCD1 fail to sustain energy production under increased metabolic stress. In neurons, reduced PTCD1 expression leads to lower ATP levels and impacts spontaneous synaptic activity. Thus, our study uncovers a possible link between a protein required for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism and AD risk.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mitochondria are the main source of cellular energy and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we identify a variant in the gene <i>PTCD1</i> that is enriched in AD patients and demonstrate that PTCD1 is required for ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation. PTCD1 regulates the level of 16S rRNA, the backbone of the mitoribosome, and is essential for mitochondrial translation and assembly of the electron transport chain. Cells expressing the AD-associated variant fail to maintain adequate ATP production during metabolic stress, and reduced PTCD1 activity disrupts neuronal energy homeostasis and dampens spontaneous transmission. Our work provides a mechanistic link between a protein required for mitochondrial function and genetic AD risk.</p>

Abstract
<p>Dopamine is hypothesized to convey error information in reinforcement learning tasks with explicit appetitive or aversive cues. However, during motor skill learning feedback signals arise from an animal’s evaluation of sensory feedback resulting from its own behavior, rather than any external reward or punishment. It has previously been shown that intact dopaminergic signaling from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta (VTA/SNc) complex is necessary for vocal learning when songbirds modify their vocalizations to avoid hearing distorted auditory feedback (playbacks of white noise). However, it remains unclear whether dopaminergic signaling underlies vocal learning in response to more naturalistic errors (pitch-shifted feedback delivered via headphones). We used male Bengalese finches (<i>Lonchura striata</i> var. <i>domestica</i>) to test the hypothesis that the necessity of dopamine signaling is shared between the two types of learning. We combined 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of dopaminergic terminals within Area X, a basal ganglia nucleus critical for song learning, with a headphones learning paradigm that shifted the pitch of auditory feedback and compared their learning to that of unlesioned controls. We found that 6-OHDA lesions affected song behavior in two ways. First, over a period of days lesioned birds systematically lowered their pitch regardless of the presence or absence of auditory errors. Second, 6-OHDA lesioned birds also displayed severe deficits in sensorimotor learning in response to pitch-shifted feedback. Our results suggest roles for dopamine in both motor production and auditory error processing, and a shared mechanism underlying vocal learning in response to both distorted and pitch-shifted auditory feedback.</p>

<p>The cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin corrects neurological phenotypes in animal models of fragile X syndrome (FX), a commonly identified genetic cause of autism and intellectual disability (ID). The therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin is being tested in clinical trials for FX; however, the structurally similar drug simvastatin has been proposed as an alternative due to an increased potency and brain penetrance. Here, we perform a side-by-side comparison of the effects of lovastatin and simvastatin treatment on two core phenotypes in <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mice versus WT littermates: excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGSs). We find that simvastatin does not correct excessive hippocampal protein synthesis in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> hippocampus at any dose tested. In fact, simvastatin significantly increases protein synthesis in both <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> and WT. Moreover, injection of simvastatin does not reduce AGS in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mouse, while lovastatin significantly reduces AGS incidence and severity versus vehicle-treated animals. These results show that unlike lovastatin, simvastatin does not correct core phenotypes in the <i>Fmr1<sup>-/y</sup></i> mouse model.</p>

Abstract
<p>Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction correlated with neuropsychiatric illness. Dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have long been associated with different aspects of reward function, but it remains to be disentangled how distinct VTA DA neurons contribute to the full range of behaviors ascribed to the VTA. Here, a recently identified subtype of VTA neurons molecularly defined by NeuroD6 (NEX1M) was addressed. Among all VTA DA neurons, less than 15% were identified as positive for NeuroD6. In addition to dopaminergic markers, sparse NeuroD6 neurons expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<i>Vglut2</i>) gene. To achieve manipulation of NeuroD6 VTA neurons, NeuroD6(NEX)-Cre-driven mouse genetics and optogenetics were implemented. First, expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) was ablated to disrupt dopaminergic function in NeuroD6 VTA neurons. Comparing <i>Vmat2<sup>lox/lox;NEX-Cre</sup></i> conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with littermate controls, it was evident that baseline locomotion, preference for sugar and ethanol, and place preference upon amphetamine-induced and cocaine-induced conditioning were similar between genotypes. However, locomotion upon repeated psychostimulant administration was significantly elevated above control levels in cKO mice. Second, optogenetic activation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons was shown to induce DA release and glutamatergic postsynaptic currents within the nucleus accumbens. Third, optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons <i>in vivo</i> induced significant place preference behavior, while stimulation of VTA neurons defined by Calretinin failed to cause a similar response. The results show that NeuroD6 VTA neurons exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.</p>

Abstract
<p>The major inhibitory interneurons in olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli are periglomerular cells (PGCs) and short axon cells (SACs). PGCs and SACs provide feedforward inhibition to all classes of projection neurons, but inhibition between PGCs and SACs is not well understood. We crossed Cre and GFP transgenic mice and used virally-delivered optogenetic constructs to selectively activate either SACs or GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs while recording from identified GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs or SACs, respectively, to investigate inhibitory interactions between these two interneuron types. We show that GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs robustly inhibit SACs and SACs strongly inhibit PGCs. SACs form the interglomerular circuit, which inhibits PGCs in distant glomeruli. Activation of GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs monosynaptically inhibit mitral cells (MCs), which complements recent findings that SACs directly inhibit MCs. Thus, both classes of glomerular inhibitory neurons inhibit each other, as well as OB output neurons. We further show that olfactory nerve input to one glomerulus engages the interglomerular circuit and inhibits PGCs in distant glomeruli. Sensory activation of the interglomerular circuit directly inhibits output neurons in other glomeruli and by inhibiting intraglomerular PGCs, may potentially disinhibit output neurons in other glomeruli. The nature and context of odorant stimuli may determine whether inhibition or excitation prevails so that odors are represented in part by patterns of active and inactive glomeruli.</p>

Abstract
<p>Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC-triggered and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/EDTA/tris (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to PBS, but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00147">Accelerated Age-Related Degradation of the Tectorial Membrane in the Ceacam16βgal/βgal Null Mutant Mouse, a Model for Late-Onset Human Hereditary Deafness DFNB113</a></h4>

CEACAM16 is a non-collagenous protein of the tectorial membrane, an extracellular structure of the cochlea essential for normal hearing. Dominant and recessive mutations in CEACAM16 have been reported to cause postlingual and progressive forms of deafness in humans. In a previous study of young Ceacam16 βgal/βgal null mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J background, the incidence of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) was greatly increased relative to Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal mice, but auditory brain-stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were near normal, indicating auditory thresholds were not significantly affected. To determine if the loss of CEACAM16 leads to hearing loss at later ages in this mouse line, cochlear structure and auditory function were examined in Ceacam16+/+, Ceacam16+/βgal and Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6 and 12 months of age and compared to that previously described at 1 month.  Analysis of older Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice reveals a progressive loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane that is more extensive in the apical, low-frequency regions of the cochlea. In Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6-7 months, the DPOAE magnitude at 2f1-f2 and the incidence of SOAEs both decrease relative to young animals. By ~12 months, SOAEs and DPOAEs are not detected in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice and ABR thresholds are increased by up to ~40 dB across frequency, despite a complement of hair cells similar to that present in Ceacam16+/+ mice. Although SOAE incidence decreases with age in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, it increases in ageing heterozygous Ceacam16+/βgal mice and is accompanied by a reduction in the accumulation of CEACAM16 in the tectorial membrane relative to controls. An apically-biased loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane, similar to that observed in young Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, is also seen in Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal  mice, and other strains of wild-type mice, but at much later ages. The loss of Ceacam16 therefore accelerates age-related degeneration of the tectorial membrane leading, as in humans with mutations in CEACAM16, to a late-onset progressive form of hearing loss.

Atypical Parkinson Syndromes (APSs) often have symptoms that overlap with those of Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in early in disease, making these disorders difficult to diagnose. Previous studies have demonstrated association of oligomeric α-synuclein (α-Syn), a key element in the pathogenesis of PD, with Sirtuin (SIRT)2 proteins for modulating PD. We aimed to evaluate SIRT proteins expression in serum of PD patients and compare it with APSs and normal elderly control (GC); and correlate with α-Syn. SIRT proteins expression was evaluated in sera of 68 PD; 34 APS and 68 GC without any neuro-psychiatric illness as controls by Surface Plasmon Resonance. SIRT2 expression was correlated with α-Syn in PD and GC. Significant (p&lt;0.0001) differences were observed between serum SIRT2 concentration in PD and APS and GC; and between APS and GC. ROC analysis revealed the strong cut off value to differentiate PD from APS and GC and also APS from GC. Significant correlation was observed among SIRT2 levels in early PD patients with UPDRS, H and Y and increase duration of disease. In addition, a strong positive correlation of SIRT2 with α-Syn (p&lt;0.0001) was observed. However, no such difference was detected for serum SIRT1 in cases of PD and APS; and GC. The present study is the first to report elevated serum SIRT2 in PD. The study also provided a simple test to distinguish PD from APS and may have translational utility for diagnosis.

Background: Short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and motor surround inhibition (mSI) are cortical phenomena that have been investigated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). mSI is believed to be necessary for the execution of fine finger movements, and SICI may participate in mSI genesis, however, the mechanisms underlying both mSI and SICI are not entirely clear. Objective: We explored the cortical physiology of SICI and mSI in healthy subjects by TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs). Methods: Single (sp) and paired-pulse (pp) TMS were delivered on the ADM muscle cortical hotspot while recording EEG and EMG. Three conditions were tested: spTMS and ppTMS at rest, and spTMS at the onset of an index finger movement. SICI and mSI were calculated on the ADM motor evoked potential (MEP) and two groups were defined based on the presence of mSI. Average TEPs were calculated for each condition and for five regions of interest. Results: At movement onset we observed a widespread reduction of the inhibitory late component N100 suggesting cortical facilitation associated with motor performance. At motor cortex level, SICI and mSI are associated with similar modulation of TEPs consisting in a reduction of P30 and an increase of N45 amplitude. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SICI and mSI modulate cortical excitability with shared inhibitory mechanisms.

Neurodegenerative diseases present a major and increasing burden in the societies worldwide. With aging populations, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, yet there are no effective cures and very few treatment options are available. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions and although the pathology is well studied, the pathogenesis of this debilitating illness is still poorly understood. This is, among other reasons, also due to the lack of good animal models as laboratory rodents do not develop spontaneous neurodegenerative diseases and human Alzheimer’s disease is only partially mimicked by transgenic rodent models. On the other hand, older dogs commonly develop canine cognitive dysfunction, a disease that is similar to Alzheimer’s disease in many aspects. Dogs show cognitive deficits that could be paralleled to human symptoms such as disorientation, memory loss, changes in behavior, and in their brains, beta amyloid plaques are commonly detected both in extracellular space as senile plaques and around the blood vessels. Dogs could be therefore potentially a very good model for studying pathological process and novel treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease. In the present article, we will review the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of canine cognitive dysfunction, its similarities and dissimilarities with Alzheimer’s disease, and developments of novel treatments for these two diseases with a focus on canine cognitive dysfunction.

Recent advances in image acquisition and processing techniques, along with the success of novel deep learning architectures, have given the opportunity to develop innovative algorithms capable to provide a better characterization of neurological related diseases. In this work, we introduce a neural network based approach to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles. Starting from their structural connectivity information, obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and represented as a graph, we evaluate the classification performances using unweighted and weighted connectivity matrices. Furthermore, we investigate the role of graph- based features for a better characterization and classification of the pathology. 90 MS patients (12 clinically isolated syndrome, 30 relapsing-remitting, 28 secondary-progressive, and 20 primary- progressive) along with 24 healthy controls, were considered in this study. This work shows the great performances achieved by neural networks methods in the classification of the clinical profiles. Furthermore, it shows local graph metrics do not improve the classification results suggesting that the latent features created by the neural network in its layers have a much important informative content. Finally, we observe that graph weights representation of brain connections preserve important information to discriminate between clinical forms.

Purpose: Estimation of uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics
is an important topic, for several reasons. Bootstrap derived
uncertainty, such as the standard deviation, provides
valuable information, and can be incorporated in MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.

Methods: In this paper, the uncertainty of different MAPMRI
metrics was quantified by estimating the empirical distributions
using the wild bootstrap. We applied the wild
bootstrap to both phantom data and human brain data, and
obtain empirical distributions for theMAP-MRImetrics returnto-
origin probability (RTOP), non-Gaussianity (NG) and propagator
anisotropy (PA).

Results: We demonstrated the impact of diffusion acquisition
scheme (number of shells and number of measurements
per shell) on the uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics.
We demonstrated how the uncertainty of these metrics can
be used to improve group analyses, and to compare different
preprocessing pipelines. We demonstrated that with
uncertainty considered, the results for a group analysis can
be different.

Conclusion: Bootstrap derived uncertain measures provide
additional information to the MAP-MRI derived metrics, and
should be incorporated in ongoing and future MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00198">Disparities in Diffuse Cortical White Matter Integrity Between Socioeconomic Groups</a></h4>

There is a growing literature demonstrating a link between lower socioeconomic status (SES) and poorer neuroanatomical health, such as smaller total and regional gray and white matter volumes, as well as greater white matter lesion volumes. Little is known, however, about the relation between SES and white matter integrity. Here we examined the relation between SES and white matter integrity of the brain’s primary cortical regions, and evaluated potential moderating influences of age and self-identified race. Participants were 192 neurologically intact, community-dwelling African American and White adults (mean age = 52 years; 44% male, 60% White, low SES = 52%) from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) SCAN study. Participants underwent 3.0-T cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to estimate regional fractional anisotropy (FA) to quantify the brain’s white matter integrity and trace to capture diffusivity. Multiple regression analyses examined independent and interactive associations of SES, age, and race with FA of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes bilaterally. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of several biopsychosocial risk factors on these associations. Exploratory analyses examined these relations with trace and using additional SES indicators. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of SES, age, and race for any region. Individuals with low SES had lower FA in all regions, and higher trace in the right and left frontal, right and left temporal, and left occipital lobes. Findings remained largely unchanged after inclusion of sensitivity variables. Older age was associated with lower FA and greater trace for all regions, except for the right temporal lobe with FA. No main effects were found for race in FA, and Whites had higher trace values in the parietal lobes. Novel findings of this study indicate that relative to the high SES group, low SES was associated with poorer white matter integrity and greater diffusivity. These results may, in part, reflect exposures to various biopsychosocial risk factors experienced by those of lower SES across the lifespan, and may help explain the preponderance of cognitive and functional disparities between socioeconomic groups.

The specific neural correlates of this construct are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 42 fMRI studies on visual vWM in healthy subjects (n=795, males=459, females=325, unknown=11; age range: 18-75). The studies were obtained after an exhaustive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brainmap database. We analyzed regional activation differences during fMRI tasks with the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping software (ES-SDM). The results were further validated by performing jackknife sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses. We investigated the effect of numerous relevant influencing factors by fitting corresponding linear regression models. We isolated consistent activation in a network containing fronto-parietal areas, right cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Regarding lateralization, the results pointed towards a bilateral frontal activation, a left-lateralization of parietal regions and a right-lateralization of the cerebellum, indicating that the left-hemisphere concept of vWM should be reconsidered. We also isolated activation in regions important for response inhibition, emphasizing the role of attentional control in vWM. Moreover, we found a significant influence of mean reaction time, load and age on activation associated with vWM. Activation in left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left precentral gyrus turned out to be positively associated with mean reaction time whereas load was associated with activation across the PFC, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex and parts of the cerebellum. In the latter case activation was mainly detectable in both hemispheres whereas the influence of age became manifest predominantly in the left hemisphere. This led us to conclude that future vWM studies should take these factors into consideration.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00178">The Human Default Consciousness and Its Disruption: Insights From an EEG Study of Buddhist Jhāna Meditation</a></h4>

The “neural correlates of consciousness” (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brain’s “default mode network”. Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as “unconscious”. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jhāna meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jhāna consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness. 

This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and “present” in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display “spindle” activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00173">EEG Microstates Analysis in Young Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder During Resting-State</a></h4>

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool to inspect the brain activity in resting-state and allows to characterize spontaneous brain activity that is not detected when a subject is cognitively engaged. Moreover, taking advantage of the high time resolution in EEG, it is possible to perform fast topographical reference-free analysis, since different scalp potential fields correspond to changes in the underlying sources within the brain. 
In this study, the spontaneous EEG resting-state (eyes closed) was compared between ten young adults ages 18-30 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and thirteen neurotypical controls. A microstate analysis was applied, focusing on four temporal parameters: mean duration, the frequency of occurrence, the ratio of time coverage, and the Global Explained Variance (GEV).
Using data that were acquired from a 65 channel EEG system, six resting-state topographies that best describe the dataset across all subjects were identified by running a two-step cluster analysis, labeled as microstate classes A-F. The results indicated that microstates B and E displayed a statistically significant differences between both groups among the temporal parameters evaluated. Classes B, D, E, and F were consistently more present in ASD, and class C in controls. The combination of these findings with the putative functional significance of the different classes suggests that during resting-state, the ASD group was more focused on visual scene-reconstruction, while the control group was more engaged with self-memory retrieval. Furthermore, from a connectivity perspective, the resting-state networks that have been previously associated with each microstate class overlap the brain regions implicated in impaired social communication and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD.

Event-related fMRI have been widely used in locating brain regions that respond to specific tasks. However, activities of brain regions which modulate or indirectly participate in the response to a specific task are not event-related. Event-related fMRI can’t locate these regulatory regions, detrimental to the integrity of the result that event-related fMRI revealed. Direct-current EEG shifts (DC shifts) have been found linked to the inner brain activity, a fusion DC shifts-fMRI method may have the ability to reveal a more complete response of the brain. In this study, we used DC shifts-fMRI to verify that even when responding to a very simple task, 1). The response of the brain is complicated than event-related fMRI generally revealed; 2). DC shifts-fMRI have the ability of revealing brain regions whose responses are not in event-related way. We used a classical and simple paradigm which is often used in auditory cortex tonotopic mapping. Data were recorded from 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) who were presented with randomly presented pure tone sequences with six different frequencies (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 Hz). Our traditional fMRI results are consistent with previous findings that the activations are concentrate on the auditory cortex. Our DC shifts-fMRI results showed that the cingulate-caudate-thalamus network which underpins sustained attention is positively activated while the dorsal attention network and the right middle frontal gyrus which underpin attention orientation are negatively activated. The regional-specific correlations between DC shifts and brain networks indicate the complexity of the response of the brain even to a simple task and that the DC shifts can effectively reflect these non-event-related inner brain activities.

Small size of an axon and presynaptic structures have hindered direct functional analysis of axonal signaling and transmitter release at presynaptic boutons in the central nervous system. However, recent technical advances in subcellular patch-clamp recordings and in fluorescent imagings are shedding light on the dynamic nature of axonal and presynaptic mechanisms. Here I summarize the functional design of an axon and presynaptic boutons, such as diversity and activity-dependent changes of action potential waveforms, Ca2+ influx, and kinetics of transmitter release, revealed by the technical tour de force of direct patch-clamp recordings and the leading-edge fluorescent imagings. I highlight the critical factors for dynamic modulation of transmitter release and presynaptic short-term plasticity.

In hippocampal CA1, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) activation via exogenous application of cholinergic agonists has been shown to presynaptically inhibit Schaffer collateral (SC) glutamatergic inputs in stratum radiatum (SR), and temporoammonic (TA) and thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) glutamatergic inputs in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). However, steady-state uniform mAChR activation may not mimic the effect of ACh release in an intact hippocampal network. To more accurately examine the effect of ACh release on glutamatergic synaptic efficacy, we measured electrically evoked synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) following the optogenetic release of ACh in genetically modified mouse brain slices. The ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse SR stimulation (stimulus 2/stimulus 1) was significantly reduced by the optogenetic release of ACh, consistent with a postsynaptic decrease in synaptic efficacy. The effect of ACh release was blocked by the M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP, the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 52432, inclusion of GDP-β-S, cesium, QX314 in the intracellular patch clamp solution, or extracellular barium. These observations suggest that ACh release decreased SC synaptic transmission through an M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inhibitory interneuron excitability, which activate GABAB receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium channels on CA1 pyramidal cells. In contrast, the ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse stimulation in the SLM was increased by ACh release, consistent with presynaptic inhibition. ACh-mediated effects in SLM were blocked by the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, presumably located on presynaptic terminals. Therefore, our data indicate that ACh release differentially modulates excitatory inputs in SR and SLM of CA1 through different cellular and network mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00266">Hedgehog Pathway Activation Alters Ciliary Signaling in Primary Hypothalamic Cultures</a></h4>

Primary cilia dysfunction has been associated with hyperphagia and obesity in both ciliopathy patients and mouse models of cilia perturbation. Neurons throughout the brain possess these solitary cellular appendages, including in the feeding centers of the hypothalamus. Several cell biology questions associated with primary neuronal cilia signaling are challenging to address in vivo. Here we utilize primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures to study ciliary signaling in relevant cell types. Importantly, these cultures contain neuronal populations critical for appetite and satiety such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti related peptide (AgRP) expressing neurons and are thus useful for studying signaling involved in feeding behavior. Correspondingly, these cultured neurons also display electrophysiological activity and respond to both local and peripheral signals that act on the hypothalamus to influence feeding behaviors, such as leptin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Interestingly, we found that cilia mediated hedgehog signaling, generally associated with developmental processes, can influence ciliary GPCR signaling (Mchr1) in terminally differentiated neurons. Specifically, pharmacological activation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway using the smoothened agonist, SAG, attenuated the ability of neurons to respond to ligands (MCH) of ciliary GPCRs. Understanding how the hedgehog pathway influences cilia GPCR signaling in terminally differentiated neurons could reveal the molecular mechanisms associated with clinical features of ciliopathies, such as hyperphagia-associated obesity.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00256">Synaptic FUS Localization During Motoneuron Development and Its Accumulation in Human ALS Synapses</a></h4>

Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene induce cytoplasmic FUS aggregations, contributing to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in certain cases. While FUS is mainly a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional processes with limited cytoplasmatic functions, it shows an additional somatodendritic localization in neurons. In this study we analyzed the localization of FUS in motoneuron synapses, these being the most affected neurons in ALS, using super-resolution microscopy to distinguish between the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. We report a maturation based variation of FUS localization in rodent synapses where a predominantly postsynaptic FUS was observed in the early stages of synaptic development, while in mature synapses the protein was entirely localized in the axonal terminal. Likewise, we also show that at the synapse of human motoneurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of a healthy control, FUS is mainly postsynaptic in the early developmental stages. In motoneurons derived from ALS patients harboring a very aggressive juvenile FUS mutation, increased synaptic accumulation of mutated FUS was observed. Moreover increased aggregation of other synaptic proteins Bassoon and Homer1 was also detected in these abnormal synapses. Having demonstrated changes in the FUS localization during synaptogenesis, a role of synaptic FUS in both dendritic and axonal cellular compartments is probable, and we propose a gain-of-toxic-function due to the synaptic aggregation of mutant FUS in ALS.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00253">Co-transplantation of Epidermal Neural Crest Stem Cells and Olfactory Ensheathing Cells Repairs Sciatic Nerve Defects in Rats</a></h4>

Cell-based therapy is an alternative strategy to improve outcomes of peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Epidermal neural crest stem cell (EPI-NCSC) is obtained from autologous tissue without immunological rejection, which could expand quickly in vitro and is suitable candidate for cell-based therapy. Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) could secrete multiple neurotrophic factors, which is often used to repair PNI individually. However, whether the combination of EPI-NCSC and OEC have better effects on PNI repair remains unclear. Here we use EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation in a rat sciatic nerve defect model to ascertain the effects and potential mechanisms of cells co-transplantation on PNI. The effect of EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation on PNI is assessed by using a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC), electrophysiological recording and neural function test. Co-transplantation of EPI-NCSC and OEC exerts a beneficial effect upon PNI such as better organized structure, nerve function recovery, and lower motoneuron apoptosis. IHC and ELISA further demonstrate that cells co-transplantation may improve PNI via the expression of BDNF and NGF up-regulated by EPI-NCSC and OEC synergistically. Eventually, the results from this study reveal that EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation effectively repairs PNI through enhancing the level of BDNF and NGF, indicating that cells co-transplantation may serve as a fruitful avenue for PNI in clinic treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00239">Activated PPARγ Abrogates Misprocessing of Amyloid Precursor Protein, Tau Missorting and Synaptotoxicity</a></h4>

Type 2 diabetes increases the risk for dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Pioglitazone (Pio), a pharmacological agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), improves insulin sensitivity and has been suggested to have potential in the management of AD symptoms, albeit through mostly unknown mechanisms. We here investigated the potential of Pio to counter synaptic malfunction and loss, a characteristic of AD pathology and its accompanying cognitive deficits. Results from experiments on primary mouse neuronal cultures and a human neural cell line (SH-SY5Y) show that Pio treatment attenuates amyloid β (Aβ)-triggered the pathological (mis-)processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and inhibits Aβ-induced accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. These events are accompanied by increased glutamatergic receptor 2B subunit (GluN2B) levels that are causally linked with neuronal death. Further, Pio treatment blocks Aβ-triggered missorting of hyperphosphorylated Tau to synapses and the subsequent loss of PSD95-positive synapses. These latter effects of Pio are PPARγ-mediated since they are blocked in the presence of GW9662, a selective PPARγ inhibitor. Collectively, these data show that activated PPARγ buffer neurons against APP misprocessing, Tau hyperphosphorylation and its missorting to synapses and subsequently, synaptic loss. These first insights into the mechanisms through which PPARγ influences synaptic loss make a case for further exploration of the potential usefulness of PPARγ agonists in the prevention and treatment of synaptic pathology in AD.

Impairments of balance predispose older people to falls. Some cognitive functions, especially executive functioning have been shown to affect balance and discriminate fallers from non-fallers. Mental flexibility is a component of the executive function and comprises multiple cognitive processes that work together to adjust the course of thoughts or actions according to the changing demands of a situation without the use of explicit instructions. However, the role of mental flexibility in balance in older people remains unclear. Mental flexibility comprises complementary cognitive functions required for dealing with unpredictable environmental demands. The study aim was to examine the relationship between mental flexibility and falls in a cohort of 212 older people (80.6 ±4.9 years; 62% female). We hypothesized that: (i) participants with impaired balance would have worse mental flexibility compared to those with good balance; and (ii) poor mental flexibility would predict falls in the sub-group with impaired balance. Balance performance was assessed by measuring postural sway while standing on a medium density foam mat with eyes open for 30 seconds. Mental flexibility was assessed using a computerized short-form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; 64 cards) with its sub-components comprising general performance, perseveration, failure-to-maintain set and conceptual ability. Falls were measured prospectively for 12-months using monthly calendars. MANCOVA revealed that WCST performance was associated with balance (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.883, F=2.168; p=0.013, partial eta squared (η2p) =.061) due primarily to reduced concept formation ability (F2,207=5.787, p=0.004, η2p =.053). Negative binomial regression analysis adjusting for age, education, contrast sensitivity, proprioception, inhibition and inhibitory choice stepping reaction time revealed that lower concept formation ability was predictive for falls (Incidence Rate Ratio 1.0648 (95% confidence interval 1.0316-1.08199)). Further, lower concept formation ability partly explained the association between balance and falls: i.e. fallers in the upper balance tertile had reduced concept formation performance whereas non-fallers had similar concept formation performance across the three balance tertiles. These findings suggest that poor mental flexibility affects the ability to maintain steady balance contributing to increased risk of falls in older people.

Background and Purpose：This study aimed to investigate whether insulin resistance (IR) was associated with overall cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in old nondiabetic healthy subjects.
Methods: We recruited old nondiabetic healthy subjects with no taking any medications prospectively. The overall effect of CSVD on the brain was described by validated CSVD score. The homeostasis model assessment–estimated insulin resistance index(HOMA-IR) was used for IR estimation, and HOMA-IR ≥2.80 was defined as IR. We evaluated the association between IR and increasing severity of CSVD score by ordinal regression models, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors.
Results: Our study included 156 healthy participants. 34 showed IR, 122 showed non-IR. The mean age of the IR group was older than non-IR group(70.03± 7.30 versus 67.45 ±5.92, p=0.04), and the ratio of hypertension in IR was higher than non-IR.( 53.28% versus 82.35%, p&lt;0.01). The distribution of lacunar, CMB, EPVS and CSVD score was different between 2 groups, but the WMH. In ordinal regression analysis, IR was positively associated with increasing severity of the total CSVD score (adjusted odds ratio 3.74, 95%CI was 1.63-5.08, and p&lt;0.01 ) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. Furthermore, HOMA-IR levels revealed a positive dose-dependent correlation with the total CSVD score(p &lt;0.01, p for trend &lt;0.01).
Conclusions: IR was independently associated with  increasing severity of overall CSVD burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in nondiabetic healthy adult population. Furthermore, HOMA-IR level is correlated with CSVD burden in a dose-dependent manner.

The mammalian auditory sensory epithelium has one of the most stereotyped cellular patterns known in vertebrates. Mechano-sensory hair cells are arranged in precise rows, with one row of inner and three rows of outer hair cells spanning the length of the spiral-shaped sensory epithelium. Aiding such precise cellular patterning, differentiation of the auditory sensory epithelium is precisely timed and follows a steep longitudinal gradient. The molecular signals that promote auditory sensory differentiation and instruct its graded pattern are largely unknown. Here, we identify Activin A and its antagonist follistatin as key regulators of hair cell differentiation and show, using mouse genetic approaches, that a local gradient of Activin A signaling within the auditory sensory epithelium times the longitudinal gradient of hair cell differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Activin-type signaling regulates a radial gradient of terminal mitosis within the auditory sensory epithelium, which constitutes a novel mechanism for limiting the number of inner hair cells being produced.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47102">Epithelial geometry regulates spindle orientation and progenitor fate during formation of the mammalian epidermis</a></h4>

The control of cell fate through oriented cell division is imperative for proper organ development. Basal epidermal progenitor cells divide parallel or perpendicular to the basement membrane to self-renew or produce differentiated stratified layers, but the mechanisms regulating the choice between division orientations are unknown. Using time-lapse imaging to follow divisions and fates of basal progenitors, we find that mouse embryos defective for the planar cell polarity (PCP) gene, <i>Vangl2</i>, exhibit increased perpendicular divisions and hyperthickened epidermis. Surprisingly, this is not due to defective Vangl2 function in the epidermis, but to changes in cell geometry and packing that arise from the open neural tube characteristic of PCP mutants. Through regional variations in epidermal deformation and physical manipulations, we find that local tissue architecture, rather than cortical PCP cues, regulates the decision between symmetric and stratifying divisions, allowing flexibility for basal cells to adapt to the needs of the developing tissue.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43842">Wind prevents cliff-breeding birds from accessing nests through loss of flight control</a></h4>

For fast-flying birds, the ability to respond to wind during landing is critical, as errors can lead to injury or even death. Nonetheless, landing ability, and its ecological significance, remain unstudied. We show that for auks, 60% of attempts to land at their cliff nests fail in a strong breeze (80% in near-gale winds). This is most likely because wind interferes with the ability to maintain flight control in the last phase of landing. Their extreme flight costs mean that the energetic penalty for multiple landing attempts is high. We propose that exposure, and ability to respond to, such conditions will influence the suitability of breeding habitat. In support of this (i) auk colonies appear to be orientated away from prevailing winds and (ii) landing success within colonies is higher on crowded ledges with more airspace for manoeuvring. More generally, the interplay between wind and flight capacities could impact breeding distributions across species and scales.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43620">Multiple mechanisms link prestimulus neural oscillations to sensory responses</a></h4>

Spontaneous fluctuations of neural activity may explain why sensory responses vary across repeated presentations of the same physical stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded electroencephalography in humans during stimulation with identical visual stimuli and analyzed how prestimulus neural oscillations modulate different stages of sensory processing reflected by distinct components of the event-related potential (ERP). We found that strong prestimulus alpha- and beta-band power resulted in a suppression of early ERP components (C1 and N150) and in an amplification of late components (after 0.4 s), even after controlling for fluctuations in 1/f aperiodic signal and sleepiness. Whereas functional inhibition of sensory processing underlies the reduction of early ERP responses, we found that the modulation of non-zero-mean oscillations (baseline shift) accounted for the amplification of late responses. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding how internal brain states modulate the processing of incoming sensory information.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Disruption of attention is an early and disabling symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood and treatment options for patients are limited. These early attention deficits are evident in the TgCRND8 mouse, a well-established murine model of AD that recapitulates several features of the disease. Here, we report severe impairment of the nicotinic receptor–mediated excitation of prefrontal attentional circuitry in TgCRND8 mice relative to wild-type littermate controls. We demonstrate that this impairment can be remedied by apamin, a bee venom neurotoxin peptide that acts as a selective antagonist to the SK family of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. We probe this seeming upregulation of calcium-sensitive inhibition and find that the attenuated nicotinic firing rates in TgCRND8 attention circuits are mediated neither by greater cellular calcium signals nor by elevated SK channel expression. Instead, we find that TgCRND8 mice show enhanced functional coupling of nicotinic calcium signals to inhibition. This SK-mediated inhibition exerts a powerful negative feedback on nicotinic excitation, dampening attention-relevant signaling in the TgCRND8 brain. These mechanistic findings identify a new cellular target involved in the modulation of attention and a novel therapeutic target for early attention deficits in AD.</span>

<p>by Mahua Roy, Stacey D. Finley</p>

Mathematical modeling provides the predictive ability to understand the metabolic reprogramming and complex pathways that mediate cancer cells’ proliferation. We present a mathematical model using a multiscale, multicellular approach to simulate avascular tumor growth, applied to pancreatic cancer. The model spans three distinct spatial and temporal scales. At the extracellular level, reaction diffusion equations describe nutrient concentrations over a span of seconds. At the cellular level, a lattice-based energy driven stochastic approach describes cellular phenomena including adhesion, proliferation, viability and cell state transitions, occurring on the timescale of hours. At the sub-cellular level, we incorporate a detailed kinetic model of intracellular metabolite dynamics on the timescale of minutes, which enables the cells to uptake and excrete metabolites and use the metabolites to generate energy and building blocks for cell growth. This is a particularly novel aspect of the model. Certain defined criteria for the concentrations of intracellular metabolites lead to cancer cell growth, proliferation or death. Overall, we model the evolution of the tumor in both time and space. Starting with a cluster of tumor cells, the model produces an avascular tumor that quantitatively and qualitatively mimics experimental measurements of multicellular tumor spheroids. Through our model simulations, we can investigate the response of individual intracellular species under a metabolic perturbation and investigate how that response contributes to the response of the tumor as a whole. The predicted response of intracellular metabolites under various targeted strategies are difficult to resolve with experimental techniques. Thus, the model can give novel predictions as to the response of the tumor as a whole, identifies potential therapies to impede tumor growth, and predicts the effects of those therapeutic strategies. In particular, the model provides quantitative insight into the dynamic reprogramming of tumor cells at the intracellular level in response to specific metabolic perturbations. Overall, the model is a useful framework to study targeted metabolic strategies for inhibiting tumor growth.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7plOrZxsCfM" width="1" />

<p>by Amir Dezfouli, Kristi Griffiths, Fabio Ramos, Peter Dayan, Bernard W. Balleine</p>

Popular computational models of decision-making make specific assumptions about learning processes that may cause them to underfit observed behaviours. Here we suggest an alternative method using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision- making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task and, in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects’ choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach using a new dataset drawn from patients with either unipolar (n = 34) or bipolar (n = 33) depression and matched healthy controls (n = 34) making decisions on a two-armed bandit task. The results indicate that this new approach is better than baseline reinforcement-learning methods in terms of overall performance and its capacity to predict subjects’ choices. We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations and thereby provides a novel clustering of subjects’ learning processes—something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJpcdSHZT0c" width="1" />

<p>In our recently published study we found that at the onset of PML serum NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients. The findings by Loonstra et al., with four additional cases with an increase in serum NfL at PML onset, support our results and further explore the dynamics of these changes. In fact they showed that also in asymptomatic patients NfL were already increased, and that NfL levels mirror PML lesion volume. This suggests that NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic MT‐ATP6 variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and seven with Neuropathy Ataxia Retinitis Pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable non‐syndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families, and demonstrated tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant‐dependent. Our findings suggest that <i>MT‐ATP6</i>‐related mitochondrial disease is best conceptualised as a spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify disease‐causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed genome‐wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping and segregation analysis for novel disease‐causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on ATP‐binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient‐derived fibroblasts, plasma and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology and biochemical quantification.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified bi‐allelic mutations in <i>PDXK</i> in five individuals from two unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair‐bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP‐binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP‐binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'‐phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in one family, improvement in power, pain and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to ambulate during the first year of PLP normalization.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that mutations in <i>PDXK</i> cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B<sub>6</sub> is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown aetiology characterised by reduced PLP levels.</p>

<p>Neuronal networks are often modeled as systems of coupled, nonlinear,
ordinary or partial differential equations. The number of differential
equations used to model a network increases with the size of the network and
the level of detail used to model individual neurons and synapses. As one
scales up the size of the simulation it becomes important to use powerful
computing platforms. Many tools exist that solve these equations numerically.
However, these tools are often platform specific. There is a high barrier of
entry to developing flexible general purpose code that is platform independent
and supports hardware acceleration on modern computing architectures such as
GPUs/TPUs and Distributed Platforms. TensorFlow is a Python-based open-source
package initially designed for machine learning algorithms, but it presents a
scalable environment for a variety of computations including solving
differential equations using iterative algorithms such as Runge Kutta methods.
In this article, organized as a series of tutorials, we present a simple
exposition of numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations using
Python and TensorFlow. It consists of a series of Python notebooks that, over
the course of five sessions, will lead novice programmers from writing programs
to integrate simple 1-dimensional differential equations using Python, to
solving a large system (1000's of differential equations) of conductance-based
neurons using a highly parallel and scalable framework. Embedded within the
tutorial is a physiologically realistic implementation of a network in the
insect olfactory system. This system, consisting of multiple neuron and synapse
types, can serve as a template to simulate other networks.

<p>In this paper, we will provide an introduction to the brain structure and
function. Brain is an astonishing living organ inside our heads, weighing about
1.5kg, consisting of billions of tiny cells. The brain enables us to sense the
world around us (to touch, to smell, to see and to hear, etc.), to think and to
respond to the world as well. The main obstacles that prevent us from creating
a machine which can behavior like real-world creatures are due to our limited
knowledge about the brain in both its structure and its function. In this
paper, we will focus introducing the brain anatomical structure and biological
function, as well as its surrounding sensory systems. Many of the materials
used in this paper are from wikipedia and several other neuroscience
introductory articles, which will be properly cited in this article. This is
the first of the three tutorial articles about the brain (the other two are
[26] and [27]). In the follow-up two articles, we will further introduce the
low-level composition basis structures (e.g., neuron, synapse and action
potential) and the high-level cognitive functions (e.g., consciousness,
attention, learning and memory) of the brain, respectively.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00146">Effects of the LPA1 Receptor Deficiency and Stress on the Hippocampal LPA Species in Mice</a></h4>

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important bioactive lipid species that functions in intracellular signaling through six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–6). Among these receptors, LPA1 is a strong candidate to mediate the central effects of LPA on emotion and may be involved in promoting normal emotional behaviors. Alterations in this receptor may induce vulnerability to stress and predispose an individual to a psychopathological disease. In fact, mice lacking the LPA1 receptor exhibit emotional dysregulation and cognitive alterations in hippocampus-dependent tasks. Moreover, the loss of this receptor results in a phenotype of low resilience with dysfunctional coping in response to stress and induces anxiety and several behavioral and neurobiological changes that are strongly correlated with mood disorders. In fact, our group proposes that maLPA1-null mice represent an animal model of anxious depression.
However, despite the key role of the LPA-LPA1-pathway in emotion and stress coping behaviors, the available information describing the mechanisms by which the LPA-LPA1-pathway regulates emotion is currently insufficient. Because activation of LPA1 requires LPA, here, we used a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization mass spectrometry-based approach to evaluate the effects of an LPA1 receptor deficiency on the hippocampal levels of LPA species. Additionally, the impact of stress on the LPA profile was also examined in both wild-type (WT) and the Malaga variant of LPA1-null mice (maLPA1-null-mice). Mice lacking LPA1 did not exhibit gross perturbations in the hippocampal LPA species, but the LPA profile was modified, showing an altered relative abundance of 18:0 LPA. Regardless of the genotype, restraint stress produced profound changes in all LPA species examined, revealing that hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress. Finally, the relationship between the hippocampal levels of LPA species and performance in the elevated plus maze was established. 
	To our knowledge, this study is the first to detect, identify and profile LPA species in the hippocampus of both LPA1-receptor null mice and WT mice at baseline and after acute stress, as well as to link these LPA species with anxiety-like behaviors. In conclusion, the hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress and may be involved in psychopathological conditions.

Hypothermia therapy is an old and important method of neuroprotection. Until now, many neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure elevation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and neonatal peripartum encephalopathy have proven to be suppressed by therapeutic hypothermia. Beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia have also been discovered, and progress has been made towards improving the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia further through combinations with other neuroprotective treatments and by probing the mechanism of hypothermia neuroprotection. In this review, we compare different hypothermia induction methods and provide a summarized account of the synergistic effect of hypothermia therapy with other neuroprotective treatments along with an overview of hypothermia neuroprotection mechanisms and cold/hypothermia-induced proteins.

There is much controversy about the optimal trade-off between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitivity and spatial precision in experiments on brain’s topology properties using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The sparse empirical evidence and regional specificity of these interactions pose a practical burden for the choice of imaging protocol parameters. Here, we test in a motor somatotopy experiment the impact of fMRI spatial resolution on differentiation between body part representations in cortex and subcortical structures. Motor somatotopy patterns were obtained in a block-design paradigm and visually cued movements of face, upper and lower limbs at 1.5, 2 and 3 mm3 spatial resolution. The degree of segregation of the body parts’ spatial representations was estimated using a pattern component model. In cortical areas, we observed the same level of segregation between somatotopy maps across all three resolutions. In subcortical areas the degree of effective similarity between spatial representations was significantly impacted by the image resolution. The 1.5 mm 3D EPI and 3 mm 2D EPI protocols led to higher segregation between motor representations compared to the 2 mm 3D EPI protocol. This finding could not be attributed to differential BOLD sensitivity or delineation of functional areas alone and suggests a crucial role of the image encoding scheme (2D vs 3D EPI). Our study contributes to the field by providing empirical evidence about the impact of acquisition protocols for the delineation of somatotopic areas in cortical and sub-cortical brain regions.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00563">Microstates as Disease and Progression Markers in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

Network dysfunction is well established in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been shown to be present early in the disease. This is especially interesting in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) since the majority later develop AD. In EEG, one type of network analysis is microstates where the EEG is divided into quasi-stable states and these microstates have been linked to networks found with resting state functional MRI. In the current exploratory study, we therefore wanted to explore the changes in microstates in MCI, and AD compared to healthy controls (HC) and whether microstates were able to separate patients with MCI who progressed (pMCI) and those who remained stable (sMCI). EEGs were recorded at baseline for 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older HC and the patients were followed for three years. To investigate whole-brain dynamics we extracted different microstate parameters. We found that patients with MCI, and AD had significantly higher occurrence (p-value = 0.028), and coverage (p-value = 0.010) for microstate A compared to HC. However, we did not find any significant systematic deviation of the transition probabilities from randomness for any of the groups. No significant differences were found between pMCI and sMCI but the largest difference in duration was found for microstate C. Microstate A has been linked to the temporal lobes in studies combining EEG and fMRI and the temporal lobes are the most affected by AD pathology in the early stages of the disease. This supports our idea that microstate A may be the first affected microstate in early AD.  Even though not significant between pMCI and sMCI, Microstate C has previously been shown to be associated with the cingulate gyri in fMRI and studies have found that posterior cingulate cortex is associated with progression from MCI to AD. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are increasing in prevalence but lack targeted therapeutics. Although the pathological mechanisms behind these diseases remain unclear, both ALS and FTD are characterized pathologically by aberrant protein aggregation and inclusion formation within neurons, which correlates with neurodegeneration. Notably, aggregation of several key proteins, including TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and tau, have been implicated in these diseases. Proteomics methods are being increasingly applied to better understand disease-related mechanisms and to identify biomarkers of disease, using model systems as well as human samples. Proteomics-based approaches offer unbiased, high-throughput, and quantitative results with numerous applications for investigating proteins of interest. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of ALS and FTD pathophysiology obtained using proteomics approaches, and we assess technical and experimental limitations. We compare findings from various mass spectrometry approaches including quantitative proteomics methods such as stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem mass tagging (TMT) to approaches such as label-free quantitation (LFQ) and sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS) in studies of ALS and FTD. Similarly, we describe disease-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies using approaches including immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and proximity dependent biotin identification (BioID) and discuss future application of new techniques including proximity-dependent ascorbic acid peroxidase labelling (APEX) and biotinylation by antibody recognition (BAR). Furthermore, we explore the use of mass spectrometry to detect post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, of disease-relevant proteins in ALS and FTD. We also discuss upstream technologies that enable enrichment of proteins of interest, highlighting the contributions of new techniques to isolate disease-relevant protein inclusions including flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking (FloIT). These recently developed approaches, as well as related advances yet to be applied to studies of these neurodegenerative diseases, offer numerous opportunities for discovery of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for ALS and FTD.

It is evident the need for designing and validating novel biomarkers for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI patients have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and for that reason the introduction of novel and reliable biomarkers is of significant clinical importance. Motivated by recent findings about the rich information of dynamic functional connectivity graphs (DFCGs) about brain (dys)function, we introduced a novel approach of identifying MCI based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG)  resting state recordings. 
The activity of different brain rhythms {δ, θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2} was first beamformed with linear constrained minimum norm variance in the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). A dynamic functional connectivity graph (DFCG) was then estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV) for both intra-frequency coupling (8) and also cross-frequency coupling pairs (28). We analysed DFCG profiles of neuromagnetic resting state recordings of 18 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and 20 healthy controls. We followed our model of identifying the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) across MEG sources and temporal segments that further leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG). We then filtered statistically and topologically every snapshot of the iDFCG with data-driven approaches. Estimation of the normalized Laplacian transformation for every temporal segment of the iDFCG and the related eigenvalues created a 2D map based on the network metric time series of the eigenvalues (NMTSeigs). NMTSeigs preserves the non-stationarity of the fluctuated synchronizability of iDCFG for each subject. Employing the initial set of 20 healthy elders and 20 MCI patients, as training set, we built an overcomplete dictionary set of network microstates (nμstates). Afterward, we tested the whole procedure in an extra blind set of 20 subjects for external validation. 
We succeeded a high classification accuracy on the blind dataset (85 %) which further supports the proposed Markovian modelling of the evolution of brain states. The adaptation of appropriate neuroinformatic tools that combine advanced signal processing and network neuroscience tools could manipulate properly the non-stationarity of time-resolved FC patterns revealing a robust biomarker for MCI.

Background
Dental anxiety is a common reason for avoiding dental visits and is associated with poor dental status. The short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory is an easy-to-use, multi-faceted questionnaire for assessing the level of trait dental anxiety. However, there was no neurophysiological data indicating if its score associates with the state anxiety when an individual is under real / mock dental environment. We hypothesized that there exists such an association.
Materials and methods
Twenty systemic healthy adults with dental attendance experience and self-claimed free of dental phobia were recruited in this cross-sectional study, with their dental anxiety level assessed by short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory. Functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded their brain signals in response to audiovisual footages resembling dental scaler or turbine in action. After the brain imaging, they gave fear ratings to the footages in visual analog scale.
Results
Participants’ short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory scores positively correlated with their responses in the insular cortex (r2 = 0.388–0.445, P &lt; 0.005). Their short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory scores also positively correlated with their fear ratings of the footages (r2 = 0.415–0.555, P &lt; 0.005). 
Discussion
Our findings indicated a possible neurobiological relevance of short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory, and reinforced its neurobiological validity in assessing dental anxiety level of dental attenders.

Empathizing leads to positive and negative consequences. To avoid empathy-induced distress, adopting a realistic view (dealing with a situation practically and efficiently independent of one’s emotional state) is important. We hypothesized that empathy-demanding professions (e.g., nursing) may require individuals to adopt a realistic view, which may demonstrate modulated neural structure and functional connectivity. We confirmed that female nurses showed a higher tendency, compared to controls, to adopt a realistic view, using the Fantasy subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (inverse scale of the realistic view). We then employed voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural underpinnings related to realistic view adoption. Nurses exhibited significantly lower gray-matter volume (GMV) in the right striatum. In multiple regression analysis, only the Fantasy subscale score showed a significant positive correlation with GMV within the striatum cluster. Moreover, nurses exhibited lower functional connectivity between the right striatum and the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), representing emotional regulation. These findings show that structural differences in the striatum correlated with the realistic view. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity between the striatum and lateral PFC suggests that nurses may use efficient coping strategies that may lessen the recruitment of effortful emotional regulation.

Motor imagery refers to the phenomenon of imagining performing an action without action execution. Motor imagery and motor execution are assumed to share a similar underlying neural system that involves primary motor cortex (M1). Previous studies have focused on motor imagery of manual actions, but articulatory motor imagery has not been investigated. In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the articulatory muscles (orbicularis oris) as well as from hand muscles (first dorsal interosseous). Twenty participants were asked to execute or imagine performing a simple squeezing task involving a pair of tweezers, which was comparable across both effectors. MEPs were elicited at six timepoints (50, 150, 250, 350, 450, 550ms post-stimulus) to track the time-course of M1 involvement in both lip and hand tasks. The results showed increased MEP amplitudes for action execution compared to rest for both effectors at time points 350, 450 and 550ms, but we found no evidence of increased cortical activation for motor imagery. The results indicate that motor imagery does not involve M1 for simple tasks for manual or articulatory muscles. The results have implications for models of mental imagery of simple articulatory gestures, in that no evidence is found for somatotopic activation of lip muscles in sub-phonemic contexts during motor imagery of such tasks, suggesting that motor simulation of relatively simple actions does not involve M1.

Cognitive dysfunction has long been recognized as a frequently observed symptom in individuals with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) such as professional boxers. The exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying this cognitive deficit have not yet been identified, but it is agreed upon that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of the most commonly affected brain regions in professional boxers. Noting the pivotal role of the two major brain metabolites in human cognitive functions, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate/glutamine (Glx), we hypothesized that alterations in levels of GABA and Glx in the PFC would be prominent and may correlate with cognitive deficits in professional boxers. Twenty male professional boxers (Boxers) and 14 age-matched healthy males who had never experienced any traumatic brain injury (CON) were recruited. Using a 3T MRI scanner, single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) sequence was performed to evaluate the levels of GABA and Glx in the PFC. Cognitive function was assessed using the memory and attention domains from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The Boxers showed lower GABA level in the PFC compared to the CON, while also showing lower performance in the attention and memory domains. There were no significant between-group differences in Glx levels. Furthermore, the GABA level correlated with memory performance in the Boxers, but not in attention performance. The current findings may suggest that alterations in GABA levels in the PFC may be a potential neurochemical correlate underlying memory dysfunction related to rmTBI.

Measuring and assessing the cognitive load  associated with different tasks is crucial for many applications, from the design of instructional materials to monitoring the mental well-being of  aircraft pilots. The goal of this paper is to utilize  EEG to infer the cognitive workload of subjects during intelligence tests. We chose the well established  advanced progressive matrices test, an ideal work-frame because it  presents problems at increasing levels of difficulty, and has been rigorously validated in past experiments. We train classic machine learning models using basic EEG measures as well as measures of network connectivity and signal complexity. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive load can be well predicted using these features, even for a low number of channels. We show that by creating an individually tuned neural network for each subject, we can improve prediction compared to a general model and that such models are robust to decreasing the number of available channels as well.

Developmental body topography, particularly of the face, is a fundamental research topic in the current decade. However, empirical investigation of this topic for very young children faces a number of difficulties related to the task requirements and technical procedures. In this study, we developed a new task to study the spatially-sensed position of facial parts in a self-face recognition task for 2.5- and 3.5-year-old children. Using the technique of augmented reality (AR) and 3D face tracking technology, we presented participants with their projected self-image on a screen, accompanied by a digital mark located on parts of their face. We prepared a cheerful visual and auditory reward on the screen when participants showed correct localization of the mark. We then tested whether they could indicate the position of the mark on their own faces and remain motivated for task repetition. To assess the efficacy of this task, thirty-one 2.5- and eleven 3.5-year-old children participated in this study. About half of the 2.5-year-olds and 80% of the 3.5-year-olds could perform more than 30 trials. Our new task, then, was to maintain young children’s motivation for task repetition using the cheerful visual and auditory reward. The analysis of localization errors suggested the uniqueness of spatial knowledge of self-face in young children. The efficacy of this new task for studying the development of body image has been confirmed.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00181">Ability-Based Emotional Intelligence Is Associated With Greater Cardiac Vagal Control and Reactivity</a></h4>

Several distinct models of Emotional Intelligence (EI) have been developed over the past two decades.  The ability model conceptualizes EI as a narrow set of interconnected, objectively measured, cognitive-emotional abilities, including the ability to perceive, manage, facilitate, and understand the emotions of the self and others. By contrast, trait or mixed models focus on subjective ratings of emotional/social competencies. Theoretically, EI is associated with neurobiological processes involved in emotional regulation and reactivity. The neurovisceral integration (NVI) model proposes a positive relationship between cardiac vagal control (CVC) and cognitive-emotional abilities similar to those encompassed by EI. The current study examined the association between CVC and EI. Because ability EI is directly tied to actual performance on emotional tasks, we hypothesized that individuals with higher ability-based EI scores would show greater levels of CVC at rest, and in response to a stressful task. Because mixed-models of EI are not linked directly to observable emotional behavior, we predicted no association with CVC. Consistent with expectations, individuals with higher levels of ability EI, but not mixed EI, had higher levels of CVC. We also found that individuals with greater levels of CVC who demonstrated reactivity to a stress induction had significantly higher EI compared to individuals that did not respond to the stress induction.  Our findings support the theoretically-expected overlap between constructs within the NVI model and ability EI model, however, the observed effect size was small, and the associations between EI and CVC should not be taken to indicate a causal connection. Results suggest that variance in the ability to understand emotional processes in oneself and to reason about one’s visceral experience may facilitate better CVC. Future work manipulating either CVC or EI may prove informative in teasing apart the causal role driving their observed relationship.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00261">Inner Ear Therapeutics: An Overview of Middle Ear Delivery</a></h4>

There are a variety of methods to access the inner ear and many of these methods depend on utilizing the middle ear as a portal.  In this approach the middle ear can be used as a passive receptacle, as part of an active drug delivery system, or simply as the most convenient way to access the inner ear directly in human subjects.  The purpose of this volume is to examine some of the more cutting-edge approaches to treating the middle ear.  Before considering these therapies, this manuscript provides an overview of some therapies that have been delivered through the middle ear both in the past and at the current time.  This manuscript also serves as a review of many of the methods for accessing the inner ear that directly utilize or pass though the middle ear.   This manuscript provides the reader a basis for understanding middle ear delivery, the basis of delivery of medicines via cochlear implants, and examines the novel approach of using hypothermia as a method of altering the responses of the inner ear to damage.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau, including the 0N4R isoform and accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (ABeta) plaques. However less than 5% of AD cases are familial, with many addition risk factors contributing to AD including ageing, lifestyle, the environment and epigenetics. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of AD have identified a number of loci that are differentially methylated in the AD cortex. Indeed, hypermethylation and reduced expression of the Ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene in AD has been reported in the cortex in numerous different post-mortem brain cohorts. Little is known about the normal function of ANK1 in the healthy brain, nor the role it may play in AD. We have generated Drosophila models to allow us to functionally characterize Drosophila Ank2, the ortholog of human ANK1 and to determine its interaction with human Tau and ABeta. We show expression of human Tau 0N4R or the oligomerizing ABeta 42 amino acid peptide caused shortened lifespan, degeneration, disrupted movement, memory loss and decreased excitability of memory neurons with co-expression tending to make the pathology worse. We find that Drosophila with reduced neuronal Ank2 expression have shortened lifespan, reduced locomotion, reduced memory and reduced neuronal excitability similar to flies overexpressing either human Tau 0N4R or ABeta42. Therefore, we show that the mis-expression of Ank2 can drive disease relevant processes and phenocopy some features of AD. Therefore, we propose targeting human ANK1 may have therapeutic potential. This represents the first study to characterize a gene implicated in AD, which was nominated from EWAS.

Merkel cells (MCs) have been proposed to form a part of the MC-neurite complex with sensory neurons. Although recent evidence has indicated that mechano-sensitive ion channels, such as transient receptor potential channels and Piezo channels, contribute to the mechanosensory transduction in MCs, the detailed mechanism for intercellular communication between MCs and neurons have yet to be clarified. The present study examined the increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by direct mechanical stimulation of MCs. We also measured [Ca2+]i in the trigeminal ganglion neurons (TGs) following direct mechanical stimulation to the MCs in an MC-TGs coculture. The MCs were isolated from hamster buccal mucosa, while TGs were isolated from neonatal Wistar rats. Both cell populations showed depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i. Direct mechanical stimulation to MCs increased [Ca2+]i, showing stimulation strength dependence. In the MC-TGs coculture, the application of direct mechanical stimulation to MCs resulted in increased [Ca2+]i in the TGs. These changes were significantly suppressed by antagonists of glutamate-permeable anion channels (4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid; DIDS), and non-competitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (MK801). Apyrase, an ATP-degrading enzyme, and suramin, a non-selective P2 purinergic receptor antagonist, did not exert inhibitory effects on these [Ca2+]i increases in the TGs following MC stimulation. These results indicated that MCs are capable of releasing glutamate, but not ATP, in response to cellular deformation by direct mechanical stimulation. The released glutamate activates the NMDA receptors on TGs. We suggest that MCs act as mechanoelectrical transducers and establish synaptic transmission with neurons, through the MC-neurite complex, to mediate mechanosensory transduction.

Meningioma expressed antigen 6 (MEA6), also called cutaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 5 (cTAGE5), was initially found in tumor tissues. MEA6 is located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites and regulates the transport of collagen, very low density lipoprotein, and insulin. It is also reported that MEA6 might be related to Fahr’s syndrome, which comprises neurological, movement, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we show that MEA6 is critical to cerebellar development and motor performance. Mice with conditional knockout of MEA6 (Nestin-Cre;MEA6F/F) display smaller sizes of body and brain compared to control animals, and survive maximal 28 days after birth. Immunohistochemical and behavioral studies demonstrate that these mutant mice have defects in cerebellar development and motor performance. In contrast, PC deletion of MEA6 (pCP2-Cre;MEA6F/F) causes milder phenotypes in cerebellar morphology and motor behaviors. While pCP2-Cre;MEA6F/F mice have normal lobular formation and gait, they present the extensive self-crossing of PC dendrites and damaged motor learning. Interestingly, the expression of key molecules that participates in cerebellar development, including Slit2 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is significantly increased in ER, suggesting that MEA6 ablation impairs ER function and thus these proteins are arrested in ER. Our study provides insight into the roles of MEA6 in the brain and the pathogenesis of Fahr’s syndrome.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00246">Sphingolipids as Emerging Mediators in Retina Degeneration</a></h4>

The sphingolipids ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), sphingosine (Sph) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) are key signaling molecules that regulate major cellular functions. Their roles in the retina have gained increasing attention during the last decade since they emerge as mediators of proliferation, survival, migration, neovascularization, inflammation and death in retina cells. As exacerbation of these processes is central to retina degenerative diseases, they appear as crucial players in their progression. This review analyzes the functions of these sphingolipids in retina cell types and their possible pathological roles. Cer appears as a key arbitrator in diverse retinal pathologies; it promotes inflammation in endothelial and retina pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and its increase is a common feature in photoreceptor death in vitro and in animal models of retina degeneration; noteworthy, inhibiting Cer synthesis preserves photoreceptor viability and functionality. In turn, S1P acts as a double edge sword in the retina. It is essential for retina development, promoting the survival of photoreceptors and ganglion cells and regulating proliferation and differentiation of photoreceptor progenitors. However, S1P has also deleterious effects, stimulating migration of Müller glial cells, angiogenesis and fibrosis, contributing to the inflammatory scenario of proliferative retinopathies and age related macular degeneration (AMD). C1P, as S1P, promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Collectively, the expanding role for these sphingolipids in the regulation of critical processes in retina cell types and in their dysregulation in retina degenerations makes them attractive targets for treating these diseases.

Background: Astrocytes are now considered as crucial modulators of neuronal synaptic transmission.  General anesthetics have been found to inhibit astrocytic activities, but it is not clear whether general anesthetics within the clinical concentration range affects the astrocyte-mediated synaptic regulation. 
Methods: The effects of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine within clinically effective ranges on the slow inward currents (SICs) were tested by using the whole-cell recording in acute prefrontal cortex (PFC) slice preparations of rats. Astrocytes culture and HPLC were used to measure the effects of different anesthetics on the glutamate release of astrocytes. 
Results: Propofol and dexmedetomidine showed no significant effect on the amplitude or frequency of SICs. Ketamine was found to inhibit the frequency of SICs in a concentration-dependent manner. The SICs synchronization rate of paired neurons was inhibited by 30 μM ketamine (from 42.5 ± 1.4% to 9.6 ± 0.8%) and was abolished by 300 μM ketamine. The astrocytic glutamate release induced by DHPG, an agonist of astrocytic type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, was not affected by ketamine, and ifenprodil, a selective antagonist of GluN1/GluN2B receptor, blocked all SICs and enhanced the inhibitory effect of 30 μM ketamine on the frequency of SICs. Ketamine at low concentration (3 μM) could inhibit the frequency of SICs, not the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), and the inhibition rate of SICs was significantly higher than mEPSCs with 30 μM ketamine (44.5 ± 3% inhibition vs. 28.3 ± 6% inhibition).
Conclusions: Our data indicated that ketamine, not propofol and dexmedetomidine, within clinical concentration range inhibits glutamatergic transmission from astrocytes to neurons, which is likely mediated by the extrasynaptic GluN1/GluN2B receptor activation.

The olfactory bulb (OB) is the first processing station in the olfactory pathway. Despite smell impairment is considered an early event in Alzheimer´s disease (AD), little is known about the initial molecular disturbances that accompany the AD development at olfactory level. We have interrogated the time-dependent OB molecular landscape in Tg2576 AD mice prior to the appearance of neuropathological amyloid plaques (2-, and 6-month-old), using combinatorial omics analysis. The metabolic modulation induced by human mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) overproduction clearly differs between both time points. Besides the progressive perturbation of the APP interactome, functional network analysis unveiled an inverse regulation of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) routes in 2-month-old Tg2576 mice respect to wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase Kinase 4 (SEK1)/ stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) axis were parallel activated in the OB of 6-months-old-Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, a survival kinome profiling performed during the aging process (2-, 6-, and 18-month-old) revealed that olfactory APP overexpression leads to changes in the activation dynamics of protein kinase A (PKA), and SEK1/MKK4-SAPK/JNK between 6 and 18 months of age, when memory deficits appear and AD pathology is well established in transgenic mice. Interestingly, both olfactory pathways were differentially activated in a stage-dependent manner in human sporadic AD subjects with different neuropathological grading. Taken together, our data reflect the early impact of mutated APP on the OB molecular homeostasis, highlighting the progressive modulation of specific signaling pathways during the olfactory amyloidogenic pathology.

Many neurodegenerative diseases manifest in an overall aged population, the pathology of which is hallmarked by abnormal protein aggregation. It is known that across aging, sleep quality becomes less efficient and protein homeostatic regulatory mechanisms deteriorate. There is a known relationship between extended wakefulness and poorly consolidated sleep and an increase in cellular stress. In an aged population, when sleep is chronically poor, and proteostatic regulatory mechanisms are less efficient, the cell is inundated with misfolded proteins and suffers a collapse in homeostasis. In this review, we explore the interplay between aging, sleep quality, and proteostasis and how these processes are implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. We also present data suggesting that reducing cellular stress and improving proteostasis and sleep quality could serve as potential therapeutic solutions for the prevention or delay in the progression of these diseases.

Behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that developmental changes lead to enhanced cortical differentiation and integration through maturation and learning, and that senescent changes during aging result in dedifferentiation and reduced cortical specialization of neural cell assemblies. We used electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to evaluate network structure and network topology dynamics during rest with eyes closed and open, and during auditory oddball task across the lifespan. For this evaluation, we constructed a hyper-frequency network (HFN) based on within- and cross-frequency coupling (WFC and CFC, respectively) at 10 oscillation frequencies ranging between 2 and 20 Hz. We found that WFC increased monotonously across the lifespan, whereas CFC showed a U-shaped relationship. These changes in WFC and CFC strengths coevolve with changes in network structure and network topology dynamics, namely the magnitude of graph-theoretical topology measures increased linearly with age (except for characteristic path length, which is going shorter), while their standard deviation showed an inverse U-shaped relationship with a peak in young adults. Temporal as well as structural or nodal similarity of network topology (with some exceptions) seems to coincide with variability changes, i.e., stronger variability is related to higher similarity between consecutive time windows or nodes. Furthermore, network complexity measures showed different lifespan-related patterns, which depended on the balance of WFC and CFC strengths. Both variability and complexity of HFNs were strongly related to the perceptual speed scores. Finally, investigation of the modular organization of the networks revealed higher number of modules and stronger similarity of community structures across time in young adults as compared with children and older adults. We conclude that network variability and complexity measures reflect temporal and structural topology changes in the functional organization and reorganization of neuronal cell assemblies across the lifespan.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46165">Sweet neurons inhibit texture discrimination by signaling TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Integration of stimuli of different modalities is an important but incompletely understood process during decision making. Here, we show that <i>Drosophila</i> are capable of integrating mechanosensory and chemosensory information of choice options when deciding where to deposit their eggs. Specifically, females switch from preferring the softer option for egg-laying when both options are sugar free to being indifferent between them when both contain sucrose. Such sucrose-induced indifference between options of different hardness requires functional sweet neurons, and, curiously, the Transmembrane Channel-like (TMC)-expressing mechanosensitive neurons that have been previously shown to promote discrimination of substrate hardness during feeding. Further, axons of sweet neurons directly contact axons of TMC-expressing neurons in the brain and stimulation of sweet neurons increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into axons of TMC-expressing neurons. These results uncover one mechanism by which <i>Drosophila</i> integrate taste and tactile information when deciding where to deposit their eggs and reveal that TMC-expressing neurons play opposing roles in hardness discrimination in two different decisions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46084">Mouse TRPA1 function and membrane localization is modulated by direct interactions with cholesterol</a></h4>

The cation channel TRPA1 transduces a myriad of noxious chemical stimuli into nociceptor electrical excitation and neuropeptide release, leading to pain and neurogenic inflammation. Despite emergent evidence that TRPA1 is regulated by the membrane environment, it remains unknown whether this channel localizes in membrane microdomains or whether it interacts with cholesterol. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and density gradient centrifugation we found that mouse TRPA1 localizes preferably into cholesterol-rich domains and functional experiments revealed that cholesterol depletion decreases channel sensitivity to chemical agonists. Moreover, we identified two structural motifs in transmembrane segments 2 and 4 involved in mTRPA1-cholesterol interactions that are necessary for normal agonist sensitivity and plasma membrane localization. We discuss the impact of such interactions on TRPA1 gating mechanisms, regulation by the lipid environment, and role of this channel in sensory membrane microdomains, all of which helps to understand the puzzling pharmacology and pathophysiology of this channel.

8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a major oxidised base modification, has been investigated to study its impact on DNA replication in hyperthermophilic <i>Archaea</i>. Here we show that 8-oxodG is formed in the genome of growing cells, with elevated levels following exposure to oxidative stress. Functional characterisation of cell-free extracts and the DNA polymerisation enzymes, PolB, PolD, and the p41/p46 complex, alone or in the presence of accessory factors (PCNA and RPA) indicates that translesion synthesis occurs under replicative conditions. One of the major polymerisation effects was stalling, but each of the individual proteins could insert and extend past 8-oxodG with differing efficiencies. The introduction of RPA and PCNA influenced PolB and PolD in similar ways, yet provided a cumulative enhancement to the polymerisation performance of p41/p46. Overall, 8-oxodG translesion synthesis was seen to be potentially mutagenic leading to errors that are reminiscent of dA:8-oxodG base pairing.

The ability to identify medical reversals and other low-value medical practices is an essential prerequisite for efforts to reduce spending on such practices. Through an analysis of more than 3000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in three leading medical journals (the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine), we have identified 396 medical reversals. Most of the studies (92%) were conducted on populations in high-income countries, cardiovascular disease was the most common medical category (20%), and medication was the most common type of intervention (33%).

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous work of ours and others has documented regressive changes in neuronal architecture and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male rats following chronic stress. As recent focus has shifted toward understanding whether chronic stress effects on mPFC are sexually dimorphic, here we undertake a comprehensive analysis to address this issue. First, we show that chronic variable stress (14-day daily exposure to different challenges) resulted in a comparable degree of adrenocortical hyperactivity, working memory impairment, and dendritic spine loss in mPFC pyramidal neurons in both sexes. Next, exposure of female rats to 21-day regimen of corticosterone resulted in a similar pattern of mPFC dendritic spine attrition and increase in spine volume. Finally, we examined the effects of another widely used regimen, chronic restraint stress (CRS, 21-day of daily 6-h restraint), on dendritic spine changes in mPFC in both sexes. CRS resulted in response decrements in adrenocortical output (habituation), and induced a pattern of consistent, but less widespread, dendritic spine loss similar to the foregoing challenges. Our data suggest that chronic stress or glucocorticoid exposure induces a relatively undifferentiated pattern of structural and functional alterations in mPFC in both males and females.</span>

<p>by Samuel P. Muscinelli, Wulfram Gerstner, Tilo Schwalger</p>

While most models of randomly connected neural networks assume single-neuron models with simple dynamics, neurons in the brain exhibit complex intrinsic dynamics over multiple timescales. We analyze how the dynamical properties of single neurons and recurrent connections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly connected networks. A novel dynamical mean-field theory for strongly connected networks of multi-dimensional rate neurons shows that the power spectrum of the network activity in the chaotic phase emerges from a nonlinear sharpening of the frequency response function of single neurons. For the case of two-dimensional rate neurons with strong adaptation, we find that the network exhibits a state of “resonant chaos”, characterized by robust, narrow-band stochastic oscillations. The coherence of stochastic oscillations is maximal at the onset of chaos and their correlation time scales with the adaptation timescale of single units. Surprisingly, the resonance frequency can be predicted from the properties of isolated neurons, even in the presence of heterogeneity in the adaptation parameters. In the presence of these internally-generated chaotic fluctuations, the transmission of weak, low-frequency signals is strongly enhanced by adaptation, whereas signal transmission is not influenced by adaptation in the non-chaotic regime. Our theoretical framework can be applied to other mechanisms at the level of single neurons, such as synaptic filtering, refractoriness or spike synchronization. These results advance our understanding of the interaction between the dynamics of single units and recurrent connectivity, which is a fundamental step toward the description of biologically realistic neural networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OZvRCla-jWg" width="1" />

Starting from one-dimensional genomics and epigenomics data that are available for hundreds of cell types, this model enables <i>de novo</i> prediction of chromatin structures at five-kilo-base resolution. Simulated chromatin structures recapitulate known features of genome organization, including the formation of chromatin loops, topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments, and are in quantitative agreement with chromosome conformation capture experiments and super-resolution microscopy measurements. Detailed characterization of the predicted structural ensemble reveals the dynamical flexibility of chromatin loops and the presence of cross-talk among neighboring TADs. Analysis of the model’s energy function uncovers distinct mechanisms for chromatin folding at various length scales and suggests a need to go beyond simple A/B compartment types to predict specific contacts between regulatory elements using polymer simulations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G9aqNMoc4To" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Neurons of the peripheral nervous system are able to regenerate injured axons, a process requiring significant cellular resources to establish and maintain long-distance growth. Genetic activation of mTORC1, a potent regulator of cellular metabolism and protein translation, improves axon regeneration of peripheral neurons by an unresolved mechanism. To gain insight into this process, we activated mTORC1 signaling in mouse nociceptors via genetic deletion of its negative regulator Tsc2. Perinatal deletion of Tsc2 in nociceptors enhanced initial axon growth after sciatic nerve crush, however by three days post-injury axon elongation rate became similar to controls. mTORC1 inhibition prior to nerve injury was required to suppress the enhanced axon growth. Gene expression analysis in purified nociceptors revealed that Tsc2-deficient nociceptors had increased activity of regeneration-associated transcription factors (RATFs), including cJun and Atf3, in the absence of injury. Additionally, nociceptor deletion of Tsc2 activated satellite glial cells and macrophages in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a similar manner to nerve injury. Surprisingly, these changes improved axon length but not percentage of initiating axons in dissociated cultures. The pro-regenerative environment in naïve DRG was recapitulated by AAV8-mediated deletion of Tsc2 in adult mice, suggesting that this phenotype does not result from a developmental effect. Consistently, AAV8-mediated Tsc2 deletion did not improve behavioral recovery after a sciatic nerve crush injury despite initially enhanced axon growth. Together, these data show that neuronal mTORC1 activation induces an incomplete pro-regenerative environment in the DRG that improves initial but not later axon growth after nerve injury.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Long distance axon regeneration poses a significant hurdle to recovery following nervous system injury. Increased mTORC1 signaling improves axon regeneration, however the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We activated neuronal mTORC1 signaling by genetically deleting Tsc2 in Nav1.8-positive neurons perinatally or by AAV8-mediated viral infection in adult mice and observed improved short- but not long-term axon regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. We suggest that Tsc2 deletion promotes initial but not later peripheral axon regeneration by upregulating expression of neuronal pro-regenerative genes and activating non-neuronal responses in the surrounding environment. Activating mTORC1 signaling in peripheral neurons may provide therapeutic benefit in circumstances with poor initial growth such as after spinal cord injury to the dorsal column or peripheral nerve repair.</p>

Abstract<p>The photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransduction and cellular calcium homeostasis. Mutations in the cone photoreceptor CNG channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 are associated with achromatopsia and cone dystrophies. CNG channel deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cone apoptosis, protein mislocalization, and ER calcium dysregulation. This work investigated the potential mechanisms of protein mislocalization associated with ER calcium dysregulation using <i>Cnga3-/-</i> mice lacking ER Ca2+ channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) specifically in cones. Deletion of <i>Ryr2</i> improved outer segment (OS) localization of the cone proteins M-opsin, S-opsin, and cone phosphodiesterase subunit α’ (PDE6C) and decreased inner segment localization. One-month-old <i>Cnga3-/-</i> mice showed approximately 30% of M-opsin, 55% of S-opsin, and 50% of PDE6C localized to the OS. <i>Cnga3-/-</i> mice with <i>Ryr2</i> deletion at the same age showed almost 60% of M- opsin, 70% of S-opsin, and 70% of PDE6C localized to the OS. Deletion of <i>Ryr2</i> nearly completely reversed elevations of the ER stress markers phospho-IRE1α and phospho-eIF2α and suppressed cone apoptosis. Consistent with the improved cone protein localization and reduced ER stress/cone apoptosis, cone survival was improved by deletion of <i>Ryr2</i>. The number of cones was increased by about 28% in 2-4 month-old <i>Cnga3-/-</i> mice with <i>Ryr2</i> deletion, compared with age-matched <i>Cnga3-/-</i> mice. This work demonstrates a role of RyR2/ER calcium dysregulation in protein mislocalization, ER stress and cone death. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration and support strategies targeting ER calcium regulation to manage retinal degeneration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransduction and photoreceptor calcium homeostasis.

<p><b>Significance statement</b> Motor skill learning typically occurs in a period when the brain needs to navigate a body that is still growing and developing. How the changing body, neural circuit formation and motor coding influence each other remains unknown. Songbirds provide excellent model systems to study motor skill learning. It has recently been shown that songbird vocal muscles double in speed during sensorimotor learning. Here we argue that these contractile as well as morphological changes stem predominantly from use and only secondarily from hormones or genetic programs. This implies that muscle training constrains skill learning trajectories. As contractile muscle property changes must require altered motor codes for achieving the same acoustic targets, the final performance results from interactions between brain and body.</p>

<p>In studies of the brain and the nervous system, extracellular signals - as
measured by local field potentials (LFPs) or electroencephalography (EEG) - are
of capital importance, as they allow to simultaneously obtain data from
multiple neurons. The exact biophysical basis of these signals is, however,
still not fully understood. Most models for the extracellular potential today
are based on volume conductor theory, which assumes that the extracellular
fluid is electroneutral and that the only contributions to the electric field
are given by membrane currents, which can be imposed as boundary conditions in
the mathematical model. This neglects a second, possibly important contributor
to the extracellular field: the time- and position-dependent concentrations of
ions in the intra- and extracellular fluids. In this thesis, a 3D model of a
single axon in extracellular fluid is presented based on the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations of electrodiffusion. This fundamental
model includes not only the potential, but also the concentrations of all
participating ion concentrations in a self-consistent way. This enables us to
study the propagation of an action potential (AP) along the axonal membrane
based on first principles by means of numerical simulations. By exploiting the
cylinder symmetry of this geometry, the problem can be reduced to two
dimensions. The numerical solution is implemented in a flexible and efficient
way, using the DUNE framework. A suitable mesh generation strategy and a
parallelization of the algorithm allow to solve the problem in reasonable time,
with a high spatial and temporal resolution. The methods and programming
techniques used to deal with the numerical challenges of this multi-scale
problem are presented in detail.

<p>The relationship between the intelligence and brain morphology is warmly
concerned in cognitive field. General intelligence can be defined as the
weighted sum of fluid and crystallized intelligence. Fluid abilities depend on
genes and genes expression and less depend on experiences. Thus, these
abilities develop rapidly during childhood, usually peaking in adulthood and
then decreasing with age. Crystallized abilities, in contrast, more depend on
experiences. However, the biological foundation of human intelligence remains
to be revealed. In this study, by utilizing the structural brain magnetic
resonance imaging from a large sample of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development Study, the largest cohort focusing in brain development and child
healthy in the United States, we aim to identify the association between
intelligence and cortical thickness in adolescents both from commonality and
individuality. We use ABCD data set around 11,000 samples cortical thickness
and cognitive scores to analysis their association, both from mean and
dispersion aspects. Using double generalized linear model, the mean model
results is almost the same as generalized linear model, we found crystallized
intelligence are more associated with cortical thickness than fluid
intelligence in adolescents around 10 years old. We found the frontal gyri
regions thickness are negative with intelligence, which is consistent with
previous study.Intelligence appears to be associated with widespread increased
mean differences and decreased heterogeneity in cortical thickness. The results
seem to support the notion that cognitive function has high heterogeneity.
Higher cognitive abilities have lower heterogeneity, and lower cognitive
abilities has higher heterogeneity.

<p>Artificial neural networks normally require precise weights to operate,
despite their origins in biological systems, which can be highly variable and
noisy. When implementing artificial networks which utilize analog 'synaptic'
devices to encode weights, however, inherent limits are placed on the accuracy
and precision with which these values can be encoded. In this work, we
investigate the effects that inaccurate synapses have on spiking neurons and
spiking neural networks. Starting with a mathematical analysis of
integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons, including different non-idealities (such as
leakage and channel noise), we demonstrate that noise can be used to make the
behavior of IF neurons more robust to synaptic inaccuracy. We then train
spiking networks which utilize IF neurons with and without noise and leakage,
and experimentally confirm that the noisy networks are more robust. Lastly, we
show that a noisy network can tolerate the inaccuracy expected when
hafnium-oxide based resistive random-access memory is used to encode synaptic
weights.

<p>Computational modeling and simulation have become essential tools in the
quest to better understand the brain's makeup and to decipher the causal
interrelations of its components. The breadth of biochemical and biophysical
processes and structures in the brain has led to the development of a large
variety of model abstractions and specialized tools, often times requiring high
performance computing resource for their timely execution. What has been
missing so far was an in-depth analysis of the complexity of the computational
kernels, hindering a systematic approach to identifying bottlenecks of
algorithms and hardware, and their combinations. If whole brain models are to
be achieved on emerging computer generations, models and simulation engines
will have to be carefully co-designed for the intrinsic hardware tradeoffs. For
the first time, we present a systematic exploration based on analytic
performance modeling. We base our analysis on three in silico models, chosen as
representative examples of the most widely employed modeling abstractions. We
identify that the synaptic formalism, i.e. current or conductance based
representations, and not the level of morphological detail, is the most
significant factor in determining the properties of memory bandwidth saturation
and shared-memory scaling of in silico models. Even though general purpose
computing has, until now, largely been able to deliver high performance, we
find that for all types of abstractions, network latency and memory bandwidth
will become severe bottlenecks as the number of neurons to be simulated grows.
By adapting and extending a performance modeling approach, we deliver a first
characterization of the performance landscape of brain tissue simulations,
allowing us to pinpoint current bottlenecks in state-of-the-art in silico
models, and make projections for future hardware and software requirements.

The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus is a substrate underlying reward seeking. Otis, Zhu, et al. demonstrate that projection-defined thalamic neurons are controlled by dissociable response features in cortical and hypothalamic inputs during reward processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Reflex epilepsies have been demonstrated to exploit specific networks that subserve normal physiological function. It is unclear whether more common forms of epilepsy share this particular feature. By measuring interictal spikes in patients with a range of epilepsies, we show that two tasks known to specifically engage the hippocampus and temporal neocortex promote increased interictal spiking within these regions, whilst a non‐hippocampal dependent task did not. This indicates that interictal spike frequency may reflect the processing demands being placed on specific functional‐anatomical networks in epilepsy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Heightened somatic symptoms are reported by a wide range of patients with chronic pain and have been associated with emotional distress and physical dysfunction. Despite their clinical significance, molecular mechanisms leading to their manifestation are not understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an association study design based on a curated list of 3,295 SNPs mapped to 358 genes to test somatic symptoms reporting using the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness (PILL) questionnaire from a case‐control cohort of orofacial pain (n=1,607). A replication meta‐analysis of three independent cohorts (n=3,189) was followed by functional validation, including <i>in silico</i> molecular dynamics, <i>in vitro</i> enzyme assays, and measures of serotonin (5‐HT) plasma concentration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>An association with T allele of rs11575542 coding for an arginine to glutamine substitution in the L‐aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme was replicated in a meta‐analysis of three independent cohorts. In a combined meta‐analysis of all cohorts this association reached <i>p</i>=6.43x10<sup>‐8</sup>. <i>In silico</i> studies demonstrated that this substitution dramatically reduces the conformational dynamics of AADC, potentially lowering its binding capacity to a co‐factor. <i>In vitro</i> enzymatic assays showed that this substitution reduces the maximum kinetic velocity of AADC, hence lowering serotonin (5‐HT) levels. Finally, plasma samples from 90 subjects showed correlation between low 5‐HT levels and heightened somatic symptoms.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thus, using functional genomics approaches, we identified a polymorphism in AADC enzyme that contributes to somatic symptoms through reduced levels of 5‐HT. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms and opens up new treatment options targeting the serotonergic system.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25522?af=R">Autism and developmental disability caused by KCNQ3 gain‐of‐function variants</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent reports have described single individuals with neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) harboring heterozygous <i>KCNQ3 de novo</i> variants (DNVs). We sought to assess whether pathogenic variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD and to elucidate the associated phenotype and molecular mechanisms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with NDD and <i>KCNQ3</i> DNVs were identified through an international collaboration. Phenotypes were characterized by clinical assessment, review of charts and EEG recordings, and parental interview. Functional consequences of variants were analyzed <i>in vitro</i> by patch‐clamp recording.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven patients were assessed. They had recurrent heterozygous DNVs in <i>KCNQ3</i> affecting residues R230 (R230C, R230H, R230S) and R227 (R227Q). All patients exhibited global developmental delay within the first two years of life. Most (8/11, 73%) were non‐verbal or had a few words only. All patients had autistic features and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was diagnosed in 5/11 (45%). EEGs performed before 10 years of age revealed frequent sleep‐activated multifocal epileptiform discharges in 8/11 (73%). For 6/9 (67%) recorded between 1.5 and 6 years of age, spikes became near‐continuous during sleep. Interestingly, most patients (9/11, 82%) did not have seizures and no patient had seizures in the neonatal period. Voltage‐clamp recordings of the mutant KCNQ3 channels revealed gain‐of‐function (GoF) effects.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Specific GoF variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD, ASD and abundant sleep‐activated spikes. This new phenotype contrasts both with self‐limited neonatal epilepsy due to <i>KCNQ3</i> partial loss‐of‐function, and with the neonatal or infantile‐onset epileptic encephalopathies due to <i>KCNQ2</i> GoF.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic <i>c9orf72</i> carriers have demonstrated cerebral white (WM) and grey matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterise cervical spinal cord (SC) changes in asymptomatic <i>c9orf72</i> hexanucleotide carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy‐two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective study of first‐degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the <i>c9orf72</i> hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9+). Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural grey (GM) and white matter (WM) metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months later. Data were analysed in C9+ and C9‐ subgroups and C9+ subjects were further stratified by age.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical vertebral level in C9+ subjects older than 40 without associated changes in GM and DTI parameters. At 18‐month follow‐up, WM atrophy was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9+ subjects older than 40 with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA reduction at baseline.</p>


<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9+ subjects older than 40 years of age and progressive CST FA reductions can be identified on 18‐month follow‐up. Cervical SC MRI readily captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in <i>c9orf72</i>‐associated conditions.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms manifested in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). The neural mechanisms contributing to its development are not yet understood. Using neurophysiological and imaging techniques, we examined the influence of residual descending motor pathways on spasticity in humans with SCI.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured spasticity in 33 individuals with motor complete SCI (determined by clinical examination) without preservation of voluntary motor output in the quadriceps femoris muscle. To examine residual descending motor pathways, we used magnetic and electrical stimulation over the leg motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the quadriceps femoris muscle and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure spinal cord atrophy.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that 60% of participants showed symptoms of spasticity, whereas the other 40% showed no spasticity, demonstrating the presence of 2 clear subgroups of humans with motor complete SCI. MEPs were only present in individuals who had spasticity, and MEP size correlated with the severity of spasticity. Spinal cord atrophy was greater in nonspastic compared with spastic subjects. Notably, the degree of spared tissue in the lateral regions of the spinal cord was positively correlated with the severity of spasticity, indicating preservation of white matter related to motor tracts when spasticity was present.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the hypothesis that preservation of descending motor pathways influences spasticity in humans with motor complete SCI; this knowledge might help the rehabilitation and assessment of people with SCI. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG‐R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG‐R using a standardized assessment.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG‐R assessment protocol was executed twice per day in adult patients after CA. EEG‐R was classified as present or absent by 3 EEG readers, blinded to patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as present. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) in 6 months after CA, dichotomized as good (CPC = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5). EEG‐R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥80% was used. Added value of EEG‐R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG‐R for poor outcome prediction had a specificity of 82% and a sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG‐R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EEG‐R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction, it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination, and SSEPs. For prediction of good outcome, EEG‐R seems to have added value.

<p>by Anna Song, Olivier Faugeras, Romain Veltz</p>

We address the question of color-space interactions in the brain, by proposing a neural field model of color perception with spatial context for the visual area V1 of the cortex. Our framework reconciles two opposing perceptual phenomena, known as simultaneous contrast and chromatic assimilation. They have been previously shown to act synergistically, so that at some point in an image, the color seems perceptually more similar to that of adjacent neighbors, while being more dissimilar from that of remote ones. Thus, their combined effects are enhanced in the presence of a spatial pattern, and can be measured as larger shifts in color matching experiments. Our model supposes a hypercolumnar structure coding for colors in V1, and relies on the notion of color opponency introduced by Hering. The connectivity kernel of the neural field exploits the balance between attraction and repulsion in color and physical spaces, so as to reproduce the sign reversal in the influence of neighboring points. The color sensation at a point, defined from a steady state of the neural activities, is then extracted as a nonlinear percept conveyed by an assembly of neurons. It connects the cortical and perceptual levels, because we describe the search for a color match in asymmetric matching experiments as a mathematical projection on color sensations. We validate our color neural field alongside this color matching framework, by performing a multi-parameter regression to data produced by psychophysicists and ourselves. All the results show that we are able to explain the nonlinear behavior of shifts observed along one or two dimensions in color space, which cannot be done using a simple linear model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0SmGf9YBYUc" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Visual search, looking for a target embedded among distractors, has long been used to study attention. Current theories postulate a two-stage process in which early visual areas perform feature extraction, while higher-order regions perform attentional selection. Such a model implies iterative communication between low- and high-level regions to sequentially select candidate targets in the array, focus attention on these elements, and eventually permit target recognition. This leads to two independent predictions: (1) high-level, attentional regions and (2) early visual regions should both be involved periodically during the search. Here, we used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) applied over the Frontal-Eye Field (FEF) in humans, known to be involved in attentional selection, at various delays while observers performed a difficult, attentional search task. We observed a periodic pattern of interference at ~6 Hz (theta) suggesting that the FEF is periodically involved during this difficult search task. We further compared this result with two previous studies (Dugué et al., 2011; 2015a) in which a similar TMS procedure was applied over the early visual cortex (V1) while observers performed the same task. This analysis revealed the same pattern of interference, i.e. V1 is periodically involved during this difficult search task, at the theta frequency. Past V1 evidence reappraised for this paper, together with our current FEF results, confirm both of our independent predictions, and suggest that difficult search is supported by low- and high-level regions, each involved periodically at the theta frequency.</p><p><b>Significant statement</b> Attention models postulate a two-stage process during visual search in which early visual regions perform feature extraction, while higher-order regions perform attentional selection, these two levels iteratively (periodically) communicating until target recognition. Using TMS, we tested whether there is a causal link between these brain regions and attentional search performance. Similar to past V1 evidence reappraised in this study, we showed that difficult attention search is supported in the FEF by periodic processing at the theta frequency (~6 Hz). Taken together, these two findings support the idea that difficult search tasks are processed by a hierarchical system involving low- and high-level regions, each involved periodically, and allowing successful attentional exploration. Nonetheless, their potential interactions remain to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>The integrated neurocognitive rehabilitation platforms (INCRPs) refer to
infrastructures and teams integrated for set of interventions which aim to
restore, or compensate for cognitive deficits. Cognitive skills may be lost or
altered due to brain damage resulting from diseases or injury. The INCRP is a

with specialists, professional staff, families, and community members to
alleviate the impact of cognitive deficits. This perspective paper would
highlight key elements required in INCRPs.

<p>Recently DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) has been advocated as a
general and promising modelling approach for neural object representation in
primate inferotemporal cortex. In this work, we show that some inherent
non-uniqueness problem exists in the DCNN-based modelling of image object

theoretical limitation of this general modelling approach, and invites due
attention to be taken in practice.

<p>Multi-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to record neuronal
activities, which could be used in the diagnosis of gene defects and drug
effects. In this paper, we address the problem of classifying in vitro MEA
recordings of mouse and human neuronal cultures from different genotypes, where
there is no easy way to directly utilize raw sequences as inputs to train an
end-to-end classification model. While carefully extracting some features by
hand could partially solve the problem, this approach suffers from obvious
drawbacks such as difficulty of generalizing. We propose a deep learning
framework to address this challenge. Our approach correctly classifies neuronal
culture data prepared from two different genotypes -- a mouse Knockout of the
delta-catenin gene and human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived neurons from
Williams syndrome. By splitting the long recordings into short slices for
training, and applying Consensus Prediction during testing, our deep learning
approach improves the prediction accuracy by 16.69% compared with feature based
Logistic Regression for mouse MEA recordings. We further achieve an accuracy of
95.91% using Consensus Prediction in one subset of mouse MEA recording data,
which were all recorded at six days in vitro. As high-density MEA recordings
become more widely available, this approach could be generalized for
classification of neurons carrying different mutations and classification of
drug responses.

Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the modulation index and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.

Diffusion MR images are prone to severe geometric distortions induced by head movement, eddy-current and inhomogeneity of magnetic susceptibility. Various correction methods have been proposed that depend on the choice of the acquisition settings and potentially provide highly different data quality. However, the impact of this choice has not been evaluated in terms of the ratio between scan time and preprocessed data quality. This study aims at investigating the impact of six well-known preprocessing methods, each associated to specific acquisition settings, on the outcome of diffusion analyses. For this purpose, we developed a comprehensive toolbox called Diffuse which automatically guides the user to the best preprocessing pipeline according to the input data. Using MR images of 20 subjects from the HCP dataset, we compared the six pre-processing pipelines regarding the following criteria: the ability to recover brain’s true geometry, the tensor model estimation and derived indices in the white matter, and finally the spatial dispersion of six well known connectivity pathways. As expected, the pipeline associated to the longer acquisition fully repeated with reversed phase-encoding (RPE) yielded the higher data quality and was used as a reference to evaluate the other pipelines. In this way, we highlighted several significant aspects of other pre-processing pipelines. Our results first established that eddy-current correction improves the tensor-fitting performance with a localized impact especially in the corpus callosum. Concerning susceptibility distortions, we showed that the use of a field map is not sufficient and involves additional smoothing, yielding to an artificial decrease of tensor-fitting error. Of most importance, our findings demonstrate that, for an equivalent scan time, the acquisition of a b0 volume with RPE ensures a better brain’s geometry reconstruction and local improvement of tensor quality, without any smoothing of the image. This was found to be the best scan time / data quality compromise. To conclude, this study highlights and attempts to quantify the strong dependence of diffusion metrics on acquisition settings and preprocessing methods.

Transmission of excitation from L4 to L2/3 is a part of the canonical circuit of cortical sensory signal processing. While synapses from L4 to L2/3 are mediated by both AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, previous studies have suggested that sensory-evoked excitation of neurons in the supragranular layers is almost entirely mediated by NMDA receptors. Here, we readdressed this question using extracellular recordings of sensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and multiple unit activity (MUA) in the rat barrel cortex. We found that blockade of NMDA receptors using the selective antagonist dAPV profoundly inhibited the late part of L2/3 SEP and MUA response but did not affect its initial part. Our results indicate that both non-NMDA and NMDA receptors are involved in the sensory signal transmission from L4 to L2/3. While non-NMDA receptors mediate fast transmission of sensory signals, NMDA receptors are involved in the generation of the late phase of the sensory-evoked response in supragranular layers.

As a consequence of worldwide improvement in health care, the aging portion of the human population has increased, now representing a higher proportion of the total population. This fact raises great concern regarding how to age while maintaining good brain function. Very often, alterations in brain electrophysiological signaling are associated with age-dependent functional disorders of the brain. Therefore, animal models suitable for the study of age-related changes in electrical activity of the brain can be very useful. Herein, we review changes in brain electrophysiological features as a function of age by analyzing studies in the rat brain on the phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Alterations in the brain’s capability to generate and propagate CSD may be related to differences in the propensity to develop certain neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, stroke, and migraine, which can biunivocally interact with the aging process. In this review, we revisit ours and others’ previous studies on electrophysiological features of the CSD phenomenon, such as its velocity of propagation and amplitude and duration of its slow negative DC shift, as a function of the animal age, as well as the interaction between age and other factors, such as ethanol consumption, physical exercise, and nutritional status. In addition, we discuss one relatively new feature through which CSD modulates brain signaling: the ability to potentiate the brain’s spontaneous electrical activity. We conclude that the CSD model might importantly contribute to a better understanding of the aging/brain signaling relationship.

Intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks has been shown to change with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  These alterations are thought to reflect changes in synaptic function, but the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examined whether Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a synaptic protein that mediates homeostatic strengthening of inhibitory circuits to control cortical excitability, is associated with functional connectivity as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in five large-scale cognitive brain networks.  In this cross-sectional study, rsfMRI scans were obtained from 130 older individuals (mean age=69 years) with normal cognition (N=113) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (N=17); NPTX2 was measured in the same individuals in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).   Higher levels of NPTX2 in CSF were associated with greater functional connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network, based on linear regression analysis. Moreover, this association was stronger among individuals with lower levels of cognitive reserve, as measured by a composite score (comprised of years of education, reading, and vocabulary measures). Additionally, higher connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network was related to better performance on a composite measure of executive function. Levels of NPTX2 were not associated with connectivity in other networks (executive control, limbic, dorsal attention, and default-mode). Findings also confirmed prior reports that individuals with MCI have lower levels of NPTX2 compared to those with normal cognition. Taken together, the results suggest that NPTX2 mechanisms may play a central role among older individuals in connectivity within the salience/ventral attention network and for cognitive tasks that require modulation of attention and response selection.

The current ‘one size fits all’ approach to our cognitive aging population is not adequate to close the gap between cognitive health span and lifespan.  In this review paper, we present a  a novel  model for understanding, preventing, and treating age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) based on the concepts precision medicine.  We will discuss how multiple risk factors can be classified into risk categories because of their interrelatedness in real life, the brain drivers or common mechanisms mediating brain aging, and the genetic variants that increase sensitivity to, or ameliorate, risk for ARCI. Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research. To that end, after briefly discussing key risk categories, brain drivers, and genetic risks, we conclude with a discussion of steps that can be taken to move the field forward.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Age is the major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there is limited evidence about MCI-specific aging-related simultaneous changes of the brain structure and their impact on cognition. We analyzed the brain imaging data from 269 subjects (97 MCI patients and 172 cognitively normal [CN] elderly) using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics procedures to explore the special structural pattern during aging. We found that the patients with MCI showed accelerated age-related reductions in gray matter volume in the left planum temporale, thalamus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. The similar age×group interaction effect was found in the fractional anisotropy of the bilateral parahippocampal cingulum white matter tract, which connects the temporal regions. Importantly, the age-related temporal gray matter and white matter alterations were more significantly related to performance in memory and attention tasks in MCI patients. The accelerated degeneration patterns in the brain structure provide evidence for different neural mechanisms underlying aging in MCI patients. Temporal structural degeneration may serve as a potential imaging marker for distinguishing the progression of the preclinical AD stage from normal aging.</span>

<p>by Atsushi Kamimura, Yoshiya J. Matsubara, Kunihiko Kaneko, Nobuto Takeuchi</p>

The emergence of replicases that can replicate themselves is a central issue in the origin of life. Recent experiments suggest that such replicases can be realized if an RNA polymerase ribozyme is divided into fragments short enough to be replicable by the ribozyme and if these fragments self-assemble into a functional ribozyme. However, the continued self-replication of such replicases requires that the production of every essential fragment be balanced and sustained. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate whether and under what conditions fragmented replicases achieve continued self-replication. We first show that under a simple batch condition, the replicases fail to display continued self-replication owing to positive feedback inherent in these replicases. This positive feedback inevitably biases replication toward a subset of fragments, so that the replicases eventually fail to sustain the production of all essential fragments. We then show that this inherent instability can be resolved by small rates of random content exchange between loose compartments (i.e., horizontal transfer). In this case, the balanced production of all fragments is achieved through negative frequency-dependent selection operating in the population dynamics of compartments. The horizontal transfer also ensures the presence of all essential fragments in each compartment, sustaining self-replication. Taken together, our results underline compartmentalization and horizontal transfer in the origin of the first self-replicating replicases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u6Ni_wi5qa8" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel H. Baker, Bruno Richard</p>

Neural systems are inherently noisy, and this noise can affect our perception from moment to moment. This is particularly apparent in binocular rivalry, where perception of competing stimuli shown to the left and right eyes alternates over time. We modulated rivalling stimuli using dynamic sequences of external noise of various rates and amplitudes. We repeated each external noise sequence twice, and assessed the consistency of percepts across repetitions. External noise modulations of sufficiently high contrast increased consistency scores above baseline, and were most effective at 1/8Hz. A computational model of rivalry in which internal noise has a 1/<i>f</i> (pink) temporal amplitude spectrum, and a standard deviation of 16% contrast, provided the best account of our data. Our novel technique provides detailed estimates of the dynamic properties of internal noise during binocular rivalry, and by extension the stochastic processes that drive our perception and other types of spontaneous brain activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ClyRZu6fYeI" width="1" />

<p>by Hongjun Bai, Yifan Li, Nelson L. Michael, Merlin L. Robb, Morgane Rolland</p>

Developing HIV-1 vaccines that trigger broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a priority as bnAbs are considered key to elicitation of a protective immune response. To investigate whether the breadth of a neutralizing antibody (nAb) depended on the conservation of its epitope among circulating viruses, we examined Antibody:Envelope (Ab:Env) interactions and worldwide Env diversity. We found that sites corresponding to bnAb epitopes were as variable as other accessible, non-hypervariable Env sites (p = 0.50, Mann-Whitney U-test) with no significant relationship between epitope conservation and neutralization breadth (Spearman’s ρ = -0.44, adjusted p = 0.079). However, when accounting for key sites in the Ab:Env interaction, we showed that the broadest bnAbs targeted more conserved epitopes (Spearman’s ρ = -0.70, adjusted p = 5.0e-5). Neutralization breadth did not stem from the overall conservation of Ab epitopes but depended instead on the conservation of key sites of the Ab:Env interaction, revealing a mechanistic basis for neutralization breadth that could be exploited for vaccine design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dQs9udkkvkI" width="1" />

<p>by Takaaki Yonekura, Akitoshi Iwamoto, Hironori Fujita, Munetaka Sugiyama</p>

Plant leaves are arranged around the stem in a beautiful geometry that is called phyllotaxis. In the majority of plants, phyllotaxis exhibits a distichous, Fibonacci spiral, decussate, or tricussate pattern. To explain the regularity and limited variety of phyllotactic patterns, many theoretical models have been proposed, mostly based on the notion that a repulsive interaction between leaf primordia determines the position of primordium initiation. Among them, particularly notable are the two models of Douady and Couder (alternate-specific form, DC1; more generalized form, DC2), the key assumptions of which are that each leaf primordium emits a constant power that inhibits new primordium formation and that this inhibitory effect decreases with distance. It was previously demonstrated by computer simulations that any major type of phyllotaxis can occur as a self-organizing stable pattern in the framework of DC models. However, several phyllotactic types remain unaddressed. An interesting example is orixate phyllotaxis, which has a tetrastichous alternate pattern with periodic repetition of a sequence of different divergence angles: 180°, 90°, −180°, and −90°. Although the term orixate phyllotaxis was derived from <i>Orixa japonica</i>, this type is observed in several distant taxa, suggesting that it may reflect some aspects of a common mechanism of phyllotactic patterning. Here we examined DC models regarding the ability to produce orixate phyllotaxis and found that model expansion via the introduction of primordial age-dependent changes of the inhibitory power is absolutely necessary for the establishment of orixate phyllotaxis. The orixate patterns generated by the expanded version of DC2 (EDC2) were shown to share morphological details with real orixate phyllotaxis. Furthermore, the simulation results obtained using EDC2 fitted better the natural distribution of phyllotactic patterns than did those obtained using the previous models. Our findings imply that changing the inhibitory power is generally an important component of the phyllotactic patterning mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BMbL9becKDc" width="1" />

<p>by Thomas M. Bury, Chris T. Bauch, Madhur Anand</p>

Geophysical models of climate change are becoming increasingly sophisticated, yet less effort is devoted to modelling the human systems causing climate change and how the two systems are coupled. Here, we develop a simple socio-climate model by coupling an Earth system model to a social dynamics model. We treat social processes endogenously—emerging from rules governing how individuals learn socially and how social norms develop—as well as being influenced by climate change and mitigation costs. Our goal is to gain qualitative insights into scenarios of potential socio-climate dynamics and to illustrate how such models can generate new research questions. We find that the social learning rate is strongly influential, to the point that variation of its value within empirically plausible ranges changes the peak global temperature anomaly by more than 1°C. Conversely, social norms reinforce majority behaviour and therefore may not provide help when we most need it because they suppress the early spread of mitigative behaviour. Finally, exploring the model’s parameter space for mitigation cost and social learning suggests optimal intervention pathways for climate change mitigation. We find that prioritising an increase in social learning as a first step, followed by a reduction in mitigation costs provides the most efficient route to a reduced peak temperature anomaly. We conclude that socio-climate models should be included in the ensemble of models used to project climate change.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uk1Hd_CczsE" width="1" />

<p>Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic targets of excitatory synaptic inputs that undergo extensive proliferation and maturation during the first postnatal month in mice. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate spines during this critical period is limited. Previous work has shown that pannexin 1 (Panx1) regulates neurite growth and synaptic plasticity. We therefore investigated the impact of global Panx1 KO on spontaneous cortical neuron activity using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and <i>in silico</i> network analysis. Panx1 KO increased both the number and size of spontaneous co-active cortical neuron network ensembles. To understand the basis for these findings, we investigated Panx1 expression in postnatal synaptosome preparations from early postnatal mouse cortex. Between 2 and 4 postnatal weeks, we observed a precipitous drop in cortical synaptosome protein levels of Panx1, suggesting it regulates synapse proliferation and/or maturation. At the same time points, we observed significant enrichment of the excitatory postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GluA1, and GluN2a in cortical synaptosomes from global Panx1 knock-out mice. <i>Ex vivo</i> analysis of pyramidal neuron structure in somatosensory cortex revealed a consistent increase in dendritic spine densities in both male and female Panx1 KO mice. Similar findings were observed in an excitatory neuron-specific Panx1 KO line (Emx1-Cre driven; Panx1 cKO<sup>E</sup>) and in primary Panx1 KO cortical neurons cultured <i>in vitro.</i> Altogether, our study suggests that Panx1 negatively regulates cortical dendritic spine development.</p>

<p>Skilled motor behavior relies on the ability to control the body and to predict the sensory consequences of this control. Although there is ample evidence that manual dexterity depends on handedness, it remains unclear whether control and prediction are similarly impacted. To address this issue, right-handed human participants performed two tasks with either the right or the left hand. In the first task, participants had to move a cursor with their hand so as to track a target that followed a quasi-random trajectory. This hand-tracking task allowed testing the ability to control the hand along an imposed trajectory. In the second task, participants had to track with their eyes a target that was self-moved through voluntary hand motion. This eye-tracking task allowed testing the ability to predict the visual consequences of hand movements. As expected, results showed that hand tracking was more accurate with the right hand than with the left hand. In contrast, eye tracking was similar in terms of spatial and temporal gaze attributes whether the target was moved by the right or the left hand. Although these results extend previous evidence for different levels of control by the two hands, they show that the ability to predict the visual consequences of self-generated actions does not depend on handedness. We propose that the greater dexterity exhibited by the dominant hand in many motor tasks stems from advantages in control, not in prediction. Finally, these findings support the notion that prediction and control are distinct processes.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Reward modulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) could be exploited in developing an autonomously updating brain-computer interface (BCI) based on a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture. For an autonomously updating RL based BCI system, we would need a reward prediction error, or a state-value representation from the user’s neural activity, which the RL-BCI agent could use to update its BCI-decoder. In order to understand the multifaceted effects of reward on M1 activity, we investigated how neural spiking, oscillatory activities and their functional interactions are modulated by conditioned stimuli related reward expectation. To do so, local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit/multiunit activities were recorded simultaneously and bilaterally from M1 cortices while four non-human primates performed cued center-out reaching or grip force tasks either manually using their right arm/hand or observed passively. We found that reward expectation influenced the strength of alpha (8-14 Hz) power, alpha-gamma comodulation, alpha spike-field coherence, and firing rates in general in M1. Furthermore, we found that an increase in alpha-band power was correlated with a decrease in neural spiking activity, that firing rates were highest at the trough of the alpha-band cycle and lowest at the peak of its cycle. These findings imply that alpha oscillations modulated by reward expectation have an influence on spike firing rate and spike timing during both reaching and grasping tasks in M1. These LFP, spike, and spike-field interactions could be used to follow the M1 neural state in order to enhance BCI decoding (An et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Knowing the subjective value of performed or observed actions is valuable feedback that could be used to improve the performance of an autonomously updating brain-computer interface (BCI). Reward-related information in the primary motor cortex (M1) may be crucial for more stable and robust BCI decoding (Zhao et al., 2018). Here, we present how expectation of reward during motor tasks, or simple observation, is represented by increased spike firing rates in conjunction with decreased alpha (8-14 Hz) oscillatory power, alpha-gamma comodulation, and alpha spike-field coherence, as compared to nonrewarding trials. Moreover, a phasic relation between alpha oscillations and firing rates was observed where firing rates were found to be lowest and highest at the peak and trough of alpha oscillations, respectively.</p>

Abstract<p>Characterizing how the brain responds to stimuli has been a goal of sensory neuroscience for decades. One key approach has been to fit linear models to describe the relationship between sensory inputs and neural responses. This has included models aimed at predicting spike trains, local field potentials, BOLD responses and EEG/MEG. In the case of EEG/MEG, one explicit use of this linear modeling approach has been the fitting of so-called temporal response functions (TRFs). TRFs have been used to study how auditory cortex tracks the amplitude envelope of acoustic stimuli, including continuous speech. However, such linear models typically assume that variations in the amplitude of the stimulus feature (i.e., the envelope) produce variations in the magnitude but not the latency or morphology of the resulting neural response. Here we show that by amplitude binning the stimulus envelope, and then using it to fit a multivariate TRF, we can better account for these amplitude-dependent changes, and that this leads to a significant improvement in model performance for both amplitude modulated noise and continuous speech in humans. We also show that this performance can be further improved through the inclusion of an additional envelope representation that emphasizes onsets and positive changes in the stimulus, consistent with the idea that while some neurons track the entire envelope, others respond preferentially to onsets in the stimulus. We contend that these results have practical implications for researchers interested in modeling brain responses to amplitude modulated sounds.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A key approach in sensory neuroscience has been to fit linear models to describe the relationship between stimulus features and neural responses. However, these linear models often assume that the response to a stimulus feature will be consistent across its time course, but just scaled linearly as a function of the stimulus feature’s intensity. Here, using EEG in humans, we show that allowing a linear model to vary as a function of the stimulus feature’s intensity leads to improved prediction of unseen neural data. We do so using both amplitude modulated noise stimuli as well as continuous natural speech. This approach provides more robust measures of envelope tracking and facilitates the study of its underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography
creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and
perform ambulatory diagnoses of neuronal diseases. This work proposes a
pairwise distance learning approach for Schizophrenia classification relying on
the spectral properties of the signal. Given the limited number of observations
(i.e. the case and/or control individuals) in clinical trials, we propose a
Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space
from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the
multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation,
further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers
with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to
adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. Results on a
case-control population show that the features extracted using the proposed
neural network lead to an improved Schizophrenia diagnosis (+10pp in accuracy
and sensitivity) against spectral features, thus suggesting the existence of
non-trivial, discriminative electrophysiological brain patterns.

<p>Whole brain segmentation using deep learning (DL) is a very challenging task
since the number of anatomical labels is very high compared to the number of
available training images. To address this problem, previous DL methods
proposed to use a global convolution neural network (CNN) or few independent
CNNs. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble method based on a large number
of CNNs processing different overlapping brain areas. Inspired by parliamentary
decision-making systems, we propose a framework called AssemblyNet, made of two
"assemblies" of U-Nets. Such a parliamentary system is capable of dealing with
complex decisions and reaching a consensus quickly. AssemblyNet introduces
sharing of knowledge among neighboring U-Nets, an "amendment" procedure made by
the second assembly at higher-resolution to refine the decision taken by the
first one, and a final decision obtained by majority voting. When using the
same 45 training images, AssemblyNet outperforms global U-Net by 28% in terms
of the Dice metric, patch-based joint label fusion by 15% and SLANT-27 by 10%.
Finally, AssemblyNet demonstrates high capacity to deal with limited training
data to achieve whole brain segmentation in practical training and testing
times.

<p>Brette (2019) criticizes the notion of neural coding because it seems to
entail that neural signals need to be decoded by or for some receiver in the
head. If that were so, then neural coding would indeed be homuncular (Brette
calls it dualistic), requiring an entity to decipher the code. But I think the
plea of Brett to think instead in terms of complex, interactive causal
throughput is preaching to the converted. Turing (not Shannon) has already
shown the way. In any case, the metaphor of neural coding has little to do with
the symbol grounding problem.

<p>The neuroscience study has revealed the discrepancy of emotion expression
between left and right hemispheres of human brain. Inspired by this study, in
this paper, we propose a novel bi-hemispheric discrepancy model (BiHDM) to
learn the asymmetric differences between two hemispheres for
electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition. Concretely, we first employ
four directed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based on two spatial
orientations to traverse electrode signals on two separate brain regions, which
enables the model to obtain the deep representations of all the EEG electrodes'
signals while keeping the intrinsic spatial dependence. Then we design a
pairwise subnetwork to capture the discrepancy information between two
hemispheres and extract higher-level features for final classification.
Besides, in order to reduce the domain shift between training and testing data,
we use a domain discriminator that adversarially induces the overall feature
learning module to generate emotion-related but domain-invariant feature, which
can further promote EEG emotion recognition. We conduct experiments on three
public EEG emotional datasets, and the experiments show that the new
state-of-the-art results can be achieved.

<p>As a follow-up tutorial article of [29], in this paper, we will introduce the
basic compositional units of the human brain, which will further illustrate the
cell-level bio-structure of the brain. On average, the human brain contains
about 100 billion neurons and many more neuroglia which serve to support and
protect the neurons. Each neuron may be connected to up to 10,000 other
neurons, passing signals to each other via as many as 1,000 trillion synapses.
In the nervous system, a synapse is a structure that permits a neuron to pass
an electrical or chemical signal to another neuron or to the target effector
cell. Such signals will be accumulated as the membrane potential of the
neurons, and it will trigger and pass the signal pulse (i.e., action potential)
to other neurons when the membrane potential is greater than a precisely
defined threshold voltage. To be more specific, in this paper, we will talk
about the neurons, synapses and the action potential concepts in detail. Many
of the materials used in this paper are from wikipedia and several other
neuroscience introductory articles, which will be properly cited in this paper.
This is the second of the three tutorial articles about the brain (the other
two are [29] and [28]). The readers are suggested to read the previous tutorial
article [29] to get more background information about the brain structure and
functions prior to reading this paper.

<p>Cortical arousals are transient events of disturbed sleep that occur
spontaneously or in response to stimuli such as apneic events. The gold
standard for arousal detection in human polysomnographic recordings (PSGs) is
manual annotation by expert human scorers, a method with significant
interscorer variability. In this study, we developed an automated method, the
Multimodal Arousal Detector (MAD), to detect arousals using deep learning
methods. The MAD was trained on 2,889 PSGs to detect both cortical arousals and
wakefulness in 1 second intervals. Furthermore, the relationship between
MAD-predicted labels on PSGs and next day mean sleep latency (MSL) on a
multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), a reflection of daytime sleepiness, was
analyzed in 1447 MSLT instances in 873 subjects. In a dataset of 1,026 PSGs,
the MAD achieved a F1 score of 0.76 for arousal detection, while wakefulness
was predicted with an accuracy of 0.95. In 60 PSGs scored by multiple human
expert technicians, the MAD significantly outperformed the average human scorer
for arousal detection with a difference in F1 score of 0.09. After controlling
for other known covariates, a doubling of the arousal index was associated with
an average decrease in MSL of 40 seconds ($\beta$ = -0.67, p = 0.0075). The MAD
outperformed the average human expert and the MAD-predicted arousals were shown
to be significant predictors of MSL, which demonstrate clinical validity the
MAD.

Neurons have evolved specialized growth structures to reach and innervate their target cells. These growth cones express specific receptor molecules that sense environmental cues and transform them into steering decisions. Historically, various concepts of axon guidance have been developed to better understand how axons reach and identify their targets. The essence of these efforts seems to be that growth cones require solid substrates, and that major guidance decisions are initiated by extracellular cues. These sometimes highly conserved ligands and receptors have been extensively characterized and mediate four major guidance forces: chemoattraction, chemorepulsion, contact attraction and contact repulsion. However, during development, cells, too, do migrate in order to reach molecularly-defined niches at target locations. In fact, axonal growth could be regarded as a special case of cellular migration, where only a highly polarized portion of the cell is elongating. Here, I combine several examples from genetically tractable model organisms, such as Drosophila or zebrafish, in which cells and axons are guided by attractive cues. Regardless, if these cues are secreted into the extracellular space or exposed on cellular surfaces, migrating cells and axons seem to keep close contact to these attractants and seem to detect them right at their source. Migration towards and along such substrate-derived attractants seem to be particularly robust, as genetic deletion induces obvious searching behaviors and permanent guidance errors. In addition, forced expression of these factors in ectopic tissues is highly distractive too, regardless of the pattern of other endogenous cues. Thus, guidance and migration towards and along attractive tissues is a powerful steering mechanism that exploits affinity differences to the surroundings and, in some instances, determines growth trajectories from source to target region.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00585">Application of Graph Theory for Identifying Connectivity Patterns in Human Brain Networks: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture.

Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls.

Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.

Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity.

Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00192">Does Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Improve Disgust Regulation Through Imagery Rescripting?</a></h4>

The first pilot studies have shown the potential of imagery rescripting (ImR) for reducing con-tamination-related pathological disgust, although the effects were rather small. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effects of ImR in reducing disgust can be further increased by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation that has been successfully used multiple times to support emotion-regulation strategies. In the present study, disgust was induced via images related to individualized sources of disgust. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers took part in two parallel experiments. The two groups were matched by age, highest educational level and gender, and were tested under two emotion-regulation conditions, namely an ImR condition and a control condition. Partici-pants performed three trials on the first day and three trials on the second day. Across both days they performed three trials under each of the two emotion-regulation conditions in a randomized order. On one day active stimulation was applied, while on the other day participants were sham stimulated. The combination of emotion-regulation and stimulation condition was balanced across subjects. The only difference between the two groups was the localization of tDCS stimulation: one group was stimulated over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the other group was stimulated over the visual cortex. This experimental manipulation was implemented to gain further insights into the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms of imagery. ImR was conducted via a previously-recorded audio file. The results confirm the effect of ImR on the reduction of disgust. However, with the present experimental design we were not able to show that supplementary tDCS of the visual cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lead to improvement.

The neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit exhibit complex electroresponsive dynamics, which are thought to play a fundamental role for network entraining, plasticity induction, signal processing and noise filtering. In order to reproduce these properties in single-point neuron models, we have optimized the Extended-Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire (E-GLIF) neuron through a multi-objective gradient-based algorithm targeting the desired input-output relationships. In this way, E-GLIF was tuned toward the unique input-output properties of Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, deep cerebellar nuclei cells and inferior olivary cells. E-GLIF proved able to simulate the complex cell-specific electroresponsive dynamics of the main olivocerebellar neurons including pacemaking, adaptation, bursting, post-inhibitory rebound excitation, subthreshold oscillations, resonance and phase reset. The integration of these E-GLIF point-neuron models into olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Networks will allow to evaluate the impact of complex electroresponsive dynamics at the higher scales, up to motor behaviour, in closed-loop simulations of sensorimotor tasks.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00258">Deletion of CD38 Suppresses Glial Activation and Neuroinflammation in a Mouse Model of Demyelination</a></h4>

CD38 is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). We recently reported that this molecule regulates the maturation and differentiation of glial cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the developing brain. To analyze its role in the demyelinating situation, we employed cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model in mice, which is characterized by oligodendrocyte-specific apoptosis, followed by the strong glial activation, demyelination and repopulation of oligodendrocytes. By using this model, we found that CD38 was upregulated in both astrocytes and microglia after CPZ administration. Experiments using wild-type and CD38 knockout (KO) mice, together with those using cultured glial cells, revealed that CD38 deficiency did not affect the initial decrease of the number of oligodendrocytes, while it attenuated CPZ-induced demyelination and neurodegeneration. Importantly, the clearance of the degraded myelin and oligodendrocyte repopulation were also reduced in CD38 KO mice. Further experiments revealed that these observations were associated with reduced levels of glial activation and inflammatory responses including phagocytosis, most likely through the enhanced level of NAD+ in CD38-deleted condition. Our results suggest that CD38 and NAD+ in the glial cells play a critical role in the demyelination and subsequent oligodendrocyte remodeling through the modulation of glial activity and neuroinflammation.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00248">Regeneration of Spinal Cord Connectivity Through Stem Cell Transplantation and Biomaterial Scaffolds</a></h4>

Significant progress has been made in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). Advances in post-trauma management and intensive rehabilitation have significantly improved the prognosis of SCI and converted what was once an “ailment not to be treated” into a survivable injury, but the cold hard fact is that we still do not have a validated method to improve the paralysis of SCI. The irreversible functional impairment of the injured spinal cord is caused by the disruption of neuronal transduction across the injury lesion, which is brought about by demyelination, axonal degeneration, and loss of synapses. Furthermore, refractory substrates generated in the injured spinal cord inhibit spontaneous recovery. The discovery of the regenerative capability of central nervous system neurons in the proper environment and the verification of neural stem cells in the spinal cord once incited hope that a cure for SCI was on the horizon. That hope was gradually replaced with mounting frustration when neuroprotective drugs, cell transplantation, and strategies to enhance remyelination, axonal regeneration, and neuronal plasticity demonstrated significant improvement in animal models of SCI but did not translate into a cure in human patients. However, recent advances in SCI research have greatly increased our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying SCI and fostered increasing optimism that these multiple treatment strategies are finally coming together to bring about a new era in which we will be able to propose encouraging therapies that will lead to appreciable improvements in SCI patients. In this review, we outline the pathophysiology of SCI that makes the spinal cord refractory to regeneration and discuss the research that has been done with cell replacement and biomaterial implantation strategies, both by itself and as a combined treatment. We will focus on the capacity of these strategies to facilitate the regeneration of neural connectivity necessary to achieve meaningful functional recovery after SCI.

Neurotrophins (NTs) are a subset of the neurotrophic factor family. These growth factors were originally named based on the nerve growth functional assays used to identify them. NTs act as paracrine or autocrine factors for cells expressing NT receptors. The receptors and their function have been studied primarily in cells of the nervous system, but are also present in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems, as well as in many neoplastic cells. The signals activated by NTs can be varied, depending on cellular stage and context, healthy or disease states, and depending on whether the specific NTs and their receptors are expressed in the relevant cells. 
In the healthy central and peripheral adult nervous systems, NTs drive neuronal survival, phenotype, synaptic maintenance, and function. Deficiencies of the NT/NT receptor axis are causally associated with disease onset or disease progression. Paradoxically, NTs can also drive synaptic loss and neuronal death. In the embryonic stage this activity is essential for proper developmental pruning of the nervous system, but in the adult it can be associated with neurodegenerative disease. 
Given their key role in neuronal survival and death, NTs and NT receptors have long been considered therapeutic targets to achieve neuroprotection. The first neuroprotective approaches consisted of enhancing neuronal survival signals using NTs. Later strategies selectively targeted receptors to induce survival signals specifically, while avoiding activation of death signals. Recently, the concept of selectively targeting receptors to reduce neuronal death signals has emerged. Here, we review the rationale of each neuroprotective strategy with respect to the complex cell biology and pharmacology of each target receptor.

Recent studies have indicated that direct administration of viral vectors or small compounds to the inner ear may aid in the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. However, due to species differences between humans and rodents, translating experimental results into clinical applications remains challenging. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is considered a pre-clinical animal model. In the present study, we describe morphometric data acquired from the temporal bone of the common marmoset in order to define the routes of topical drug administration to the inner ear. Dissection and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were performed on the fixed cadaverous heads of thirteen common marmosets. To investigate potential routes for drug administration to the inner ear, we explored the anatomy of the round window, oval window, semicircular canal, and endolymphatic sac. Among these, the approach via the round window with posterior tympanotomy appeared feasible for delivering drugs to the inner ear without manipulating the tympanic membrane, minimizing the chances of conductive hearing loss. The courses of four critical nerves (including the facial nerve) were visualized using three-dimensional DTT, which may help to avoid nerve damage during surgery. Finally, to investigate the feasibility of actual drug administration, we measured the volume of the round window niche, which was approximately 0.9 µL. The present findings may help to establish experimental standards for evaluating new therapies in this primate model.

In olfaction, all volatile odor information is tunneled through the main olfactory bulb (OB). Odor information is then processed before it is transferred to higher brain centers.  Odor processing in the OB is carried out by numerous local inhibitory circuits and modulated by top-down input. Top-down modulation of OB function has been shown to act via interneurons but evidence also exists for its direct impact onto the principle mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts). Here, we used monosynaptic rabies trans-synaptic tracing from the OB to map and quantify the local and top-down presynaptic landscape of M/Ts and local inhibitory interneurons. We found that M/Ts receive a significant amount of top-down inputs from various brain regions that matches qualitatively but not quantitatively those that synapse onto local inhibitory inter-neurons. These results show that M/Ts are direct targets of top-down inputs.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00057">Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Tau Protein During Synthetic Torpor</a></h4>

Tau protein is of primary importance for many physiological processes in neurons, where it affects the dynamics of the microtubule system. When hyperphosphorylated (PP-Tau), Tau monomers detach from microtubules and tend to aggregate firstly in oligomers, and then in neurofibrillary tangles, as it occurs in a group of neurodegenerative disorders named thauopathies. 
A hypothermia-related accumulation of PP-Tau, which is quickly reversed after the return to normothermia, has been shown to occur in the brain of hibernators during torpor. Since, recently, in our lab, a hypothermic torpor-like condition (synthetic torpor, ST) was pharmacologically induced in the rat, a non-hibernator, the aim of the present work was to assess whether ST can lead to a reversible PP-Tau accumulation in the rat brain. 
PP-Tau was immunohistochemically assessed by staining for AT8 (phosphorylated Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau) in 19 brain structures, which were chosen mostly due to their involvement in the regulation of autonomic and cognitive functions in relation to behavioral states. During ST, AT8 staining was strongly expressed throughout the brain, while Tau-1 staining was reduced compared to control conditions. During the following recovery period, AT8 staining progressively reduced close to zero after 6h from ST. However, Tau-1 staining remained low even after 38h from ST. Thus, overall, these results show that ST induced an accumulation of PP Tau that was, apparently, only partially reversed to normal during the recovery period. 
While the accumulation of PP-Tau may only depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the enzymes regulating Tau phosphorylation, the reverse process of dephosphorylation should be actively regulated, also in non-hibernators. In conclusion, in this work a reversible and widespread PP-Tau accumulation has been induced through a procedure that leads a non-hibernator to a degree of reversible hypothermia, which is comparable to that observed in hibernators. Therefore, the physiological mechanism involved in this process can sustain an adaptive neuronal response to extreme conditions, which may however lead to neurodegeneration when particular intensities and durations are exceeded.

Several different potassium channels modulate the activity of sleep-promoting neurons in the Drosophila brain, but the regulation of these channels is not completely understood. A recent study (Kempf et al., Nature, 2019) found that one of the potassium channel subunits, Hyperkinetic, alters the firing properties of sleep-promoting neurons in response to NADPH oxidation. These findings are the first to link cellular redox state and mitochondrial metabolism directly to sleep.

In the human brain, oscillations occur during neural processes that are relevant for memory. This has been demonstrated by a plethora of studies relating memory processes to specific oscillatory signatures. Several recent studies have gone beyond such correlative approaches and provided evidence supporting the idea that modulating oscillations via frequency-specific entrainment can alter memory functions. Such causal evidence is important because it allows distinguishing mechanisms directly related to memory from mere epiphenomenal oscillatory signatures of memory.

Phenotypic plasticity is associated with non-genetic drug tolerance in several cancers. Such plasticity can arise from chromatin remodeling, transcriptomic reprogramming, and/or protein signaling rewiring, and is characterized as a cell state transition in response to molecular or physical perturbations. This, in turn, can confound interpretations of drug responses and resistance development. Using <i>BRAF-</i>mutant melanoma cell lines as the prototype, we report on a joint theoretical and experimental investigation of the cell-state transition dynamics associated with BRAF inhibitor drug tolerance. Thermodynamically motivated surprisal analysis of transcriptome data was used to treat the cell population as an entropy maximizing system under the influence of time-dependent constraints. This permits the extraction of an epigenetic potential landscape for drug-induced phenotypic evolution. Single-cell flow cytometry data of the same system were modeled with a modified Fokker-Planck-type kinetic model. The two approaches yield a consistent picture that accounts for the phenotypic heterogeneity observed over the course of drug tolerance development. The results reveal that, in certain plastic cancers, the population heterogeneity and evolution of cell phenotypes may be understood by accounting for the competing interactions of the epigenetic potential landscape and state-dependent cell proliferation. Accounting for such competition permits accurate, experimentally verifiable predictions that can potentially guide the design of effective treatment strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KSNvbwW46_A" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oligomeric forms of amyloid β‐protein (oAβ) are believed to be principally responsible for neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, but it is not known whether anti‐Aβ antibodies are capable of lowering oAβ levels in humans.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an ultrasensitive immunoassay and used it to measure oAβ in CSF from 104 AD subjects participating in the ABBY and BLAZE Phase 2 trials of the anti‐Aβ antibody crenezumab. Patients received subcutaneous (SC) crenezumab (300mg) or placebo every two weeks or else intravenous (IV) crenezumab (15mg/kg) or placebo every four weeks for 68 weeks. Ninety‐eight of the 104 patients had measurable baseline oAβ levels, and these were compared to levels at week 69 in placebo (N=28), SC (N=35) and IV (N=35) treated patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those receiving crenezumab, 89% of SC and 86% of IV patients had lower levels of oAβ at week 69 versus baseline. The difference in the proportion of patients with decreasing levels was significant for both treatment arms: p=0.0035 for SC and p=0.01 for IV crenezumab vs. placebo. The median percentage change was ‐48% in the SC arm and ‐43% in the IV arm. No systematic change was observed in the placebo group, with a median change of ‐13% and equivalent portions with negative and positive change.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Crenezumab lowered CSF oAβ levels in the large majority of treated patients tested. These results support engagement of the principal pathobiological target in AD and identify CSF oAβ as a novel pharmacodynamic biomarker for use in trials of anti‐Aβ agents.</p>

<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and commonly devastating form of human epilepsy for which only symptomatic therapy is available. One cause of TLE is an episode of <i>de novo</i> prolonged seizures [status epilepticus (SE)]. Understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms by which SE transforms a brain from normal to epileptic may reveal novel targets for preventive and disease-modifying therapies. SE-induced activation of the BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, is one signaling pathway by which SE induces TLE. Although activation of TrkB signaling promotes development of epilepsy in this context, it also reduces SE-induced neuronal death. This led us to hypothesize that distinct signaling pathways downstream of TrkB mediate the desirable (neuroprotective) and undesirable (epileptogenesis) consequences. We subsequently demonstrated that TrkB-mediated activation of phospholipase C1 is required for epileptogenesis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the TrkB-Shc-Akt signaling pathway mediates the neuroprotective consequences of TrkB activation following SE. We studied measures of molecular signaling and cell death in a model of SE in mice of both sexes, including wild-type and <i>TrkB<sup>Shc/Shc</sup></i> mutant mice in which a point mutation (Y515F) of TrkB prevents the binding of Shc to activated TrkB kinase. Genetic disruption of TrkB-Shc signaling had no effect on severity of SE yet partially inhibited activation of the prosurvival adaptor protein Akt. Importantly, genetic disruption of TrkB-Shc signaling exacerbated hippocampal neuronal death induced by SE. We conclude that therapies targeting TrkB signaling for preventing epilepsy should spare TrkB-Shc-Akt signaling and thereby preserve the neuroprotective benefits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and devastating form of human epilepsy that lacks preventive therapies. Understanding the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying the development of TLE may identify novel therapeutic targets. BDNF signaling thru TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase is one molecular mechanism promoting TLE. We previously discovered that TrkB-mediated activation of phospholipase C1 promotes epileptogenesis. Here we reveal that TrkB-mediated activation of Akt protects against hippocampal neuronal death <i>in vivo</i> following status epilepticus. These findings strengthen the evidence that desirable and undesirable consequences of status epilepticus-induced TrkB activation are mediated by distinct signaling pathways downstream of this receptor. These results provide a strong rationale for a novel therapeutic strategy selectively targeting individual signaling pathways downstream of TrkB for preventing epilepsy.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder is the most common mental illness. Mounting evidence indicates that astrocytes play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of depression; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Compared with other neuronal cell types, astrocytes are enriched for arachidonic acid metabolism. Herein, we observed brain-region-specific alterations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) signaling, which is an arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, in both a mouse model of depression and postmortem samples from patients with depression. The enzymatic activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the key enzyme in EET signaling, was selectively increased in the mPFC of susceptible mice after chronic social defeated stress and was negatively correlated with the social interaction ratio, which is an indicator of depressive-like behavior. The specific deletion of <i>Ephx2</i> (encode sEH) in adult astrocytes induced resilience to stress, whereas the impaired EET signaling in the mPFC evoked depressive-like behaviors in response to stress. sEH was mainly expressed on lysosomes of astrocytes. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches performed on C57BL/6J background adult male mice, we found that EET signaling modulated astrocytic ATP release <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, astrocytic ATP release was required for the antidepressant-like effect of <i>Ephx2</i> deletion in adult astrocytes. In addition, sEH inhibitors produced rapid antidepressant-like effects in multiple animal models of depression, including chronic social defeated stress and chronic mild stress. Together, our results highlight that EET signaling in astrocytes in the mPFC is essential for behavioral adaptation in response to psychiatric stress.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells of the brain, play a vital role in the pathophysiology of depression. Astrocytes secrete adenosine ATP, which modulates depressive-like behaviors. Notably, astrocytes are enriched for arachidonic acid metabolism. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that epoxyeicosatrienoic acid signaling, an arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, modulates astrocytic ATP release and the expression of depressive-like behaviors. Our work demonstrated that epoxyeicosatrienoic acid signaling in astrocytes in the mPFC is essential for behavioral homeostatic adaptation in response to stress, and the extent of astrocyte functioning is greater than expected based on earlier reports.</p>

<p>An essential aspect of goal-directed decision-making is selecting actions based on anticipated consequences, a process that involves the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and potentially, the plasticity of dendritic spines in this region. To investigate this possibility, we trained male and female mice to nose poke for food reinforcers, or we delivered the same number of food reinforcers non-contingently to separate mice. We then decreased the likelihood of reinforcement for trained mice, requiring them to modify action–outcome expectations. In a separate experiment, we blocked action–outcome updating via chemogenetic inactivation of the OFC. In both cases, successfully selecting actions based on their likely consequences was associated with fewer immature, thin-shaped dendritic spines and a greater proportion of mature, mushroom-shaped spines in the ventrolateral OFC. This pattern was distinct from spine loss associated with aging, and we identified no effects on hippocampal CA1 neurons. Given that the OFC is involved in prospective calculations of likely outcomes, even when they are not observable, constraining spinogenesis while preserving mature spines may be important for solidifying durable expectations. To investigate causal relationships, we inhibited the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (encoded by <i>Fmr1</i>), which constrains dendritic spine turnover. Ventrolateral OFC-selective <i>Fmr1</i> knockdown recapitulated the behavioral effects of inducible OFC inactivation (and lesions; also shown here), impairing action–outcome conditioning, and caused dendritic spine excess. Our findings suggest that a proper balance of dendritic spine plasticity within the OFC is necessary for one's ability to select actions based on anticipated consequences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Navigating a changing environment requires associating actions with their likely outcomes and updating these associations when they change. Dendritic spine plasticity is likely involved, yet relationships are unconfirmed. Using behavioral, chemogenetic, and viral-mediated gene silencing strategies and high-resolution microscopy, we find that modifying action–outcome expectations is associated with fewer immature spines and a greater proportion of mature spines in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Given that the OFC is involved in prospectively calculating the likely outcomes of one's behavior, even when they are not observable, constraining spinogenesis while preserving mature spines may be important for maintaining durable expectations.</p>

<p>An innocuous sensory stimulus that reliably signals an upcoming aversive event can be conditioned to elicit locomotion to a safe location before the aversive outcome ensues. The neural circuits that mediate the expression of this signaled locomotor action, known as <i>signaled active avoidance</i>, have not been identified. While exploring sensorimotor midbrain circuits in mice of either sex, we found that excitation of GABAergic cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata blocks signaled active avoidance by inhibiting cells in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), not by inhibiting cells in the superior colliculus or thalamus. Direct inhibition of putative-glutamatergic PPT cells, excitation of GABAergic PPT cells, or excitation of GABAergic afferents in PPT, abolish signaled active avoidance. Conversely, excitation of putative-glutamatergic PPT cells, or inhibition of GABAergic PPT cells, can be tuned to drive avoidance responses. The PPT is an essential junction for the expression of signaled active avoidance gated by nigral and other synaptic afferents.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When a harmful situation is signaled by a sensory stimulus (e.g., street light), subjects typically learn to respond with active or passive avoidance responses that circumvent the threat. During signaled active avoidance behavior, subjects move away to avoid a threat signaled by a preceding innocuous stimulus. We identified a part of the midbrain essential to process the signal and avoid the threat. Inhibition of neurons in this area eliminates avoidance responses to the signal but preserves escape responses caused by presentation of the threat. The results highlight an essential part of the neural circuits that mediate signaled active avoidance behavior.</p>

<p>External thermosensation is crucial to regulate animal behavior and homeostasis, but the development of the mammalian thermosensory system is not well known. We investigated whether temperature could play a role in the control of movements in a mammalian model born very immature, the opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica</i>). Like other marsupials, at birth the opossum performs alternate and rhythmic movements with its forelimbs (FLs) to reach a teat where it attaches in order to continue its development. It was shown that FL movements can be induced by mechanical stimulation of the snout in <i>in vitro</i> preparations of newborns consisting of the neuraxis with skin and FLs intact. In the present study, we used puff ejections of cold, neutral (bath temperature) and hot liquid directed toward the snout to induce FL responses in such preparations. Either the responses were visually observed under a microscope or triceps muscle activity was recorded. Cold liquid systematically induced FL movements and triceps contractions, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerves and removal of the facial skin diminished responses to cold and nearly abolished those to hot and neutral stimulations. Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) being the major cold receptor cation channel in adult mammals, we employed immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test for its expression, but found that it is not expressed before 13 postnatal days. Overall our results indicate that cold thermosensation exerts a strong influence on motor behaviors in newborn opossums.</p>

Abstract
<p>Acquisition of social proficiency entails behavioral adaptations to social experience, including both behavioral flexibility and inhibition of behaviors inappropriate in specific social contexts. Here, we investigated the contributions of testosterone and FosB, a transcription factor linked to experience-dependent neural plasticity, to the adolescent maturation of social proficiency in male-female social interactions. To determine whether pubertal testosterone organizes circuits underlying social proficiency, we first compared behavioral adaptations to sexual experience in male Syrian hamsters that were deprived of testosterone during puberty (prepubertal castration; NoT@P) to those of males deprived of testosterone for an equivalent period of time in adulthood (postpubertal castration; T@P). All males were given testosterone replacement in adulthood for two weeks before sexual behavior testing, where males were allowed to interact with a receptive female once per week for five consecutive weeks. T@P males showed the expected decrease in ectopic (mis-directed) mounts with sexual experience, whereas NoT@P males did not. In addition, sexual experience induced <i>FosB</i> gene products expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL) in T@P, but not NoT@P, males. Overexpression of FosB via an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector in the IL of NoT@P males prior to sexual behavior testing was sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype similar to that of experienced T@P males. Finally, overexpression of FosB in IL increased the density of immature spines on IL dendrites. Our findings provide evidence that social proficiency acquired through sexual experience is organized by pubertal testosterone through the regulation of FosB in the IL, possibly through increasing synaptic lability.</p>

Abstract
<p>Neuronal excitability in the vertebrate brain is governed by the coordinated activity of both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. In the cerebellum, spontaneous action potential (AP) firing of inhibitory stellate cells (SCs) is variable, typically operating within the 5- to 30-Hz frequency range. AP frequency is shaped by the activity of somatodendritic A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels and the inhibitory effect of GABAergic transmission. An added complication, however, is that whole-cell recording from SCs induces a time-dependent and sustained increase in membrane excitability making it difficult to define the full range of firing rates. Here, we show that whole-cell recording in cerebellar SCs of both male and female mice augments firing rates by reducing the membrane potential at which APs are initiated. AP threshold is lowered due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Whole-cell recording also elicits a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels which contributes to increased firing rates. Hodgkin–Huxley modeling and pharmacological experiments reveal that gating shifts in A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel activity do not impact AP threshold, but rather promote channel inactivation which removes restraint on the upper limit of firing rates. Taken together, our work reveals an unappreciated impact of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels that work in coordination with A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels to regulate the firing frequency of cerebellar SCs.</p>

Abstract<p>A crucial step in understanding visual input is its organization into meaningful components, in particular object contours and partially occluded background structures. This requires that all contours are assigned to either the foreground or the background (border ownership assignment). While earlier studies showed that neurons in primate extrastriate cortex signal border ownership for simple geometric shapes, recent studies show consistent border ownership coding also for complex natural scenes. In order to understand how the brain performs this task, we developed a biologically plausible recurrent neural network that is fully image-computable. Our model uses local edge detector () cells and grouping () cells whose activity represents proto-objects based on the integration of local feature information.  cells send modulatory feedback connections to those  cells that caused their activation, making the  cells border ownership selective. We found close agreement between our model and neurophysiological results in terms of the timing of border ownership signals as well as the consistency of border ownership signals across scenes. We also benchmarked our model on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and achieved performance comparable to recent state-of-the-art computer vision approaches. Our proposed model provides insight into the cortical mechanisms of figure-ground organization.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b></p><p>Figure-ground organization is the process of segmenting an image into regions corresponding to objects and background. This process is reflected in the activity of cells in extrastriate cortex that show border ownership selectivity, encoding the location of an object relative to their receptive fields. We propose a model that can explain border ownership coding in natural scenes. Recurrent connections allow for integration of local and global object information, resulting in fast scene segmentation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0087-19.2019v1?rss=1">Molecular, morphological, and functional characterization of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1-expressing neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala</a></h4>

<p>The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a brain region implicated in anxiety, stress-related disorders and the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, <i>Crh)</i> acting at cognate type 1 receptors (CRF<sub>1</sub>, <i>Crhr1</i>) modulates inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the CeA. Here, we used CRF<sub>1</sub>:GFP reporter mice to characterize the morphological, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of CRF<sub>1</sub> expressing (CRF<sub>1</sub>+) and CRF<sub>1</sub> non-expressing (CRF<sub>1</sub>-) neurons in the CeA. We assessed these two neuronal populations for distinctions in the expression of GABAergic subpopulation markers and neuropeptides, dendritic spine density and morphology, and excitatory transmission. We observed that CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>+ neurons are GABAergic but do not segregate with calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin, or PKC. Among the neuropeptides analyzed, <i>Penk</i> and <i>Sst</i> had the highest percentage of co-expression with <i>Crhr1</i> in both the medial and lateral CeA subdivisions. Additionally, CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>+ neurons had a lower density of dendritic spines, which was offset by a higher proportion of mature spines compared to neighboring CRF<sub>1</sub>- neurons. Accordingly, there was no difference in basal spontaneous glutamatergic transmission between the two populations. Application of CRF increased overall vescicular glutamate release onto both CRF<sub>1</sub>+ and CRF<sub>1</sub>- neurons, and does not effect amplitude or kinetics of excitatory post-synaptic currents in either population. These novel data highlight important differences in the neurochemical make-up and morphology of CRF<sub>1</sub>+ compared to CRF<sub>1</sub>- neurons, which may have important implications for the transduction of CRF signaling in the CeA.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE</b> Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is involved in emotional regulation via hypothalamic and amygdalar circuits, and is implicated in several psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders. Our novel identification of unique molecular, morphological and functional properties to distinguishing CRF<sub>1</sub>+ neurons in the central amygdala represents a critical step in understanding the cellular role and dysregulation of the CRF system in pathological conditions.</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are chronic, progressive and age-associated neurological disorders characterized by neuronal deterioration in specific brain regions. Although the specific pathological mechanisms underlying these disorders have remained elusive, ion channel dysfunction has become increasingly accepted as a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are encoded by the HCN1-4 gene family and conduct the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih). These channels play important roles in modulating cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, dendritic integration and synaptic transmission. In the present review we first provide a comprehensive picture of the role of HCN channels in PD by summarizing their role in the regulation of neuronal activity in PD-related brain regions. Dysfunction of Ih may participate in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced toxicity and represent a pathogenic mechanism in PD. Given current reports that the critical role of HCN channels in neuroinflammation and depression, we also discussed the putative contribution of HCN channels in inflammatory processes and non-motor symptoms in PD. In the second section, we summarize how HCN channels regulate the formation of β-amyloid peptide in AD and the role of these channels in learning and memory. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of HCN channels in ALS and SMA based on existing discoveries.

Mood disorders have multiple phenotypes and complex underlying biological mechanisms, and as such, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. A review of recent work on the role of astrocytes in mood disorders is thus warranted and we argue that there is tremendous potential for novel strategies for therapeutic interventions based on the role of astrocytes.
Astrocytes are traditionally considered to have supporting roles within the brain, yet emerging evidence has shown that astrocytes have more direct roles in influencing brain function. Notably, evidence from postmortem human brain tissues has highlighted changes in glial cell morphology, density and astrocyte-related biomarkers and genes following mood disorders, indicating astrocyte involvement in mood disorders. Findings from animal models imply strongly that astrocytes not only change astrocyte morphology and physiological characteristics but also influence neural circuits via synapse structure and formation. This review pays particular attention to interactions between astrocytes and neurons and argues that astrocyte dysfunction affects the monoaminergic system, excitatory-inhibitory balance and neurotrophic states of local networks. Together, these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the exact role of astrocytes in mood disorders.
Changing focus from neurons to glial cells and their interactions is important so that we can understand newly proposed mechanisms underlying mood disorders, and to identify more diagnostic indicators or effective targets for treatment of these diseases.

Iron homeostasis is an essential prerequisite for metabolic and neurological functions throughout the healthy human life, with a dynamic interplay between intracellular and systemic iron metabolism. The development of different neurodegenerative diseases is associated with alterations of the intracellular transport of iron and heavy metals, principally mediated by Divalent Metal Transporter1 (DMT1), responsible for Non Transferrin Bound Iron transport (NTBI). In addition, DMT1 regulation and its compartmentalization in specific brain regions play important roles during aging. This review highlights the contribution of DMT1 to the physiological exchange and distribution of body iron and heavy metals during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. DMT1 also mediates the crosstalk between central nervous system and peripheral tissues, by systemic diffusion through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), with the involvement of peripheral iron homeostasis in association with inflammation. In conclusion, a survey about the role of DMT1 and iron will illustrate the complex panel of interrelationship with aging, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.

Neuroinflammation plays an important role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. However, it is difficult to evaluate inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) or the relationship between neuroinflammation and disease progression in ALS patients. Recent advances in the field of exosomes and CNS-derived exosomes extraction technology provide the possibility of measuring the inflammatory status in the CNS without brain biopsy. In this pilot study, we extracted astrocyte-derived exosomes from the plasma of sporadic ALS patients and age-, sex-matched healthy controls and determined Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IL-6 levels in astrocyte-derived exosomes were increased in sALS patients and positively associated with the rate of disease progression. However, the association between IL-6 levels and disease progression rate was limited to patients whose disease duration were less than 12 months. These data suggest an increased inflammatory cascade in the CNS of sALS patients. Our pilot study demonstrates that CNS-derived exosomes could be useful to reveal neuroinflammation of the CNS in ALS patients.

The right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) has been proposed as the region where conscious olfactory perception arises; however, evidence supporting this hypothesis has all been collected from neuroimaging and lesion studies in which only correlation and not a temporal pattern can be established. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) causes a reversible disruption of cortical activity and has been used successfully to disrupt orbitofrontal activity. To overcome intrinsic limitations of current experimental research, a crossover, double-blind, prospective and longitudinal study was carried out in which cTBS was applied over the rOFC to evaluate its effect on odorant stimuli detection. All subjects received real and sham cTBS. Experimental procedures were done in two different sessions with a separation of at least one week between them to avoid carryover and learning effects. A total of 15 subjects completed the experiment, and their data were included in the final analysis (10 women, 5 men, mean age 22.40 ± 3.41). Every session consisted of two different measures of the conscious olfactory perception task: A baseline measure and one 5 minutes after cTBS/sham. Compared to baseline, marks in the olfactory task during the sham cTBS session increased (p =0.010), while marks during the real cTBS session decreased (p =0.017). Our results support the hypothesis that rOFC is an important node of a complex network required for conscious olfactory perception to arise. However, the exact mechanism that explains our results is unclear and could be explained by the disruption of other cognitive functions related to the rOFC.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles induced by phosphorylation of tau protein and neuronal apoptosis are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).The dementia rate in the alcoholic abusers were found to be higher than the control people. The present study explored potential roles of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) in AD pathological process.The results showed that ADH1B level decreased significantly both in the serum of AD patients and in the hippocampus of APP/PS-1 AD model mice.The apoptotic rate was reduced and the viability was elevated significantly for the AD model cell transfected with ADH1B over-expressed vector. Moreover,the level of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a receptor of Aβ1-42,was down-regulated in the ADH1B over-expressed AD model cell and up-regulated in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. Furthermore, the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax decreased significantly, and Bcl-2 level increased in the cells when overexpressing ADH1B.The opposite trend of cleaved caspase-3,Bax and Bcl-2 were observed in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. The level of reactive oxidative species (ROS) was found to be reduced in the ADH1B over-expressed cells and be enhanced when transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. These results indicated that ADH1B might be significant in the prevention of AD, especially for the abusers of alcohol, and a new potential target of AD treatment.

Nav1.2, a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit encoded by the Scn2a gene, has been implicated in various brain disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Nav1.2 is known to regulate the generation of action potentials in the axon initial segment and their propagation along axonal pathways. Nav1.2 also regulates synaptic integration and plasticity by promoting back-propagation of action potentials to dendrites, but whether Nav1.2 deletion in mice affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and/or disease-related animal behaviors remains largely unclear. Here we report that mice heterozygous for the Scn2a gene (Scn2a+/– mice) show decreased neuronal excitability and suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission in the presence of network activity in the hippocampus. In addition, Scn2a+/– mice show suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation in association with impaired spatial learning and memory, but show largely normal locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behavior, and whole-brain excitation. These results suggest that Nav1.2 regulates hippocampal neuronal excitability, excitatory synaptic drive, long-term potentiation, and spatial learning and memory in mice.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00569">Neurogenesis in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Role of MFG-E8</a></h4>

Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating medical conditions with no effective treatments. Restoration of impaired neurogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein that plays a wide range of cellular functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, anti-inflammation, tissue regeneration and homeostasis. The beneficial role of MFG-E8 has been shown in cerebral ischemia (stroke), neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In stroke, MFG-E8 promotes neural stem cell proliferation and their migration towards the ischemic brain tissues. These novel functions of MFG-E8 are primarily mediated through its receptor αvβ3-integrin. Here we focus on the pivotal role of MFG-E8 in protecting against neuronal diseases by promoting neurogenesis. We also discuss the mechanisms of MFG-E8-mediated neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and migration, and the potential of MFG-E8 for neural stem cell niche maintenance via angiogenesis. We propose further investigation of the molecular pathways for MFG-E8 signaling in NSPC and effective strategies for MFG-E8 delivery across the blood-brain barrier, which will help develop MFG-E8 as a future drug candidate for the bedside management of neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00568">Cortical Excitability Dynamics During Fear Processing</a></h4>

Background: Little is known about the modulation of cortical excitability in the prefrontal cortex during fear processing in humans. Here, we aimed to transiently modulate and test the cortical excitability during fear processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and brain oscillations in theta and alpha frequency bands with electroencephalography (EEG). 
Methods: We conducted two separate experiments (no-TMS and TMS). In the no-TMS experiment, EEG recordings were performed during the instructed fear paradigm in which a visual cue (CS+) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), while the other visual cue was unpaired (CS-). In the TMS experiment, in addition the TMS was applied on the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The participants also underwent structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and were assigned pseudo-randomly to both experiments, such that age and gender were matched. The cortical excitability was evaluated by time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity with weighted phase lag index (WPLI). We further linked the excitability patterns with markers of stress coping capability.
Results: After visual cue onset, we found increased theta power in the frontal lobe and decreased alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+ relative to CS- trials. TMS of dmPFC increased theta power in the frontal lobe and reduced alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+. The TMS pulse increased the information flow from the sensorimotor region to the prefrontal and occipital regions in the theta and alpha bands respectively during CS+ compared to CS-. Pre-stimulation frontal theta power (0.75-1 s) predicted the magnitude of frontal theta power changes after stimulation (1-1.25 s). Finally, the increased frontal theta power during CS+ compared to CS- was positively correlated with stress coping behavior. 
Conclusion: Our results show that TMS over dmPFC transiently modulated the regional cortical excitability and the fronto-occipital information flows during fear processing, while the pre-stimulation frontal theta power determined the strength of achieved effects. The frontal theta power may serve as a biomarker for fear processing and stress-coping responses in individuals and could be clinically tested in mental disorders.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the major component of the ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates seen in the majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases. TDP-43 belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family that is involved in the regulation of RNA transcription, splicing, transport and translation. There are a great many hnRNPs, which often have overlapping functions and act cooperatively in RNA processing. Here we demonstrate that another hnRNP family member, hnRNP E2, shows a striking accumulation within dystrophic neurites and cytoplasmic inclusions in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of a subset of FTLD-TDP cases belonging to pathological subtypes A and C, where hnRNP E2 was found to co-localize with 85% of TDP-43 immunopositive inclusions. hnRNP E2-positive inclusions were not seen in FTLD-TDP cases with the C9orf72 expansion or in any other neurodegenerative disorders examined. This interaction with TDP-43 in specific FTLD subtypes suggests different underlying neurodegenerative pathways.

Reliable EEG source analysis depends on sufficiently detailed and accurate head models. In this study, we investigate how uncertainties inherent to the experimentally determined conductivity values of the different conductive compartments influence the results of EEG source analysis.
In a single source scenario, the superficial and focal somatosensory P20/N20 component, we analyze the influence of varying conductivities on dipole reconstructions using a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) approach. We find that in particular the conductivity uncertainties for skin and skull have a significant influence on the EEG inverse solution, leading to variations in source localization by several centimeters. The conductivity uncertainties for gray and white matter were found to have little influence on the source localization, but a strong influence on the strength and orientation of the reconstructed source, respectively. As the CSF conductivity is most accurately determined of all conductivities in a realistic head model, CSF conductivity uncertainties had a negligible influence on the source reconstruction. This small uncertainty is a further benefit of distinguishing the CSF in realistic volume conductor models.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediates the communication between the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, CNS insulin resistance has been elucidated to play a role in neurodegenerative disease. This has stimulated a wealth of information on the molecular impact of insulin in the brain, particularly in the improvement of cognition. Since the BBB regulates the transport of insulin into the brain and thus, helps to regulate CNS levels, alterations in the BBB response to insulin could impact CNS insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize the effect of insulin on some of the cell types that make up the BBB, including endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. We broadly discuss how these changes in specific cell types could ultimately impact the BBB. We also summarize how insulin can regulate levels of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau within each cell type. Finally, we suggest interventional approaches to overcome detrimental effects on the BBB in regards to changes in insulin transport.

The overall goal of this study is to develop thickness shear mode (TSM) resonators for real-time, label-free, non-destructive sensing of biological adhesion events in small populations (hundreds) of neurons in a cell culture medium and subsequently in vivo in the future. Such measurements will enable discoveries of the role of biomechanical events in neuronal function and dysfunction. Conventional TSM resonators have been used for chemical sensing and biosensing applications in media with hundreds of thousands of cells in culture. However, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional TSM devices need to be further enhanced for sensing smaller cell populations or molecules of interest. In this report, we focus on key challenges such as eliminating inharmonics in solution and maximizing Q-factor while simultaneously miniaturizing the active sensing (electrode) area to make them suitable for small populations of cells. We use theoretical expressions for sensitivity and electrode area of TSM sensors operating in liquid. As a validation of the above design effort, we fabricated prototype TSM sensors with resonant frequencies of 42, 47, 75 and 90 MHz and characterized their performance in liquid using electrode diameters of 150, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 μm and electrode thicknesses of 33 and 230 nm. We validated a candidate TSM resonator with the highest sensitivity and Q-factor for real-time monitoring of adhesion of cortical neurons. We reduced the size of the sensing area to 150-400 μm for TSM devices improving the spatial resolution by monitoring few 100s to 1000s of neurons. Finally, we modified the electrode surface with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) to further enhance adhesion and sensitivity of the TSM sensor to adhering neurons (Marx, 2003).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key technology in multimodal animal studies of brain connectivity and disease pathology. In vivo MRI provides non-invasive, whole brain macroscopic images containing structural and functional information, thereby complementing invasive in vivo high-resolution microscopy and ex vivo molecular techniques. Brain mapping, the correlation of corresponding regions between multiple brains in a standard brain atlas system, is widely used in human MRI. For small animal MRI, however, there is no scientific consensus on pre-processing strategies and atlas-based neuroinformatics. Thus, it remains difficult to compare and validate results from different pre-clinical studies which were processed using custom-made code or individual adjustments of clinical MRI software and without a standard brain reference atlas. Here, we describe AIDAmri, a novel Atlas-based Imaging Data Analysis pipeline to process structural and functional mouse brain data including anatomical MRI, fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The AIDAmri pipeline includes automated pre-processing steps, such as raw data conversion, skull-stripping and bias-field correction as well as image registration with the Allen Brain Reference Atlas (ARA). Following a modular structure developed in Python scripting language, the pipeline integrates established and newly developed algorithms. Each processing step was optimized for efficient data processing requiring minimal user-input and user programming skills. The raw data is analyzed and results transferred to the ARA coordinate system in order to allow an efficient and highly-accurate region-based analysis. AIDAmri is intended to fill the gap of a missing open-access and cross-platform toolbox for the most relevant mouse brain MRI sequences thereby facilitating data processing in large cohorts and multi-center studies.

Due to the limited field of view of the microscopes, acquisitions of macroscopic specimens require many parallel image stacks to cover the whole volume of interest.
Overlapping regions are introduced among stacks in order to make it possible automatic alignment by means of a 3D stitching tool.
Since state-of-the-art microscopes coupled with chemical clearing procedures can generate 3D images whose size exceeds the Terabyte, parallelization is required to keep stitching time within acceptable limits.

In the present paper we discuss how multi-level parallelization reduces the execution times of TeraStitcher, a tool designed to deal with very large images.
%Parallelization has been carried out in such a way that its impact on user interface and software maintenance is negligible.
Two algorithms performing dataset partition for efficient parallelization in a transparent way are presented together with experimental results proving the effectiveness of the approach that achieves a speedup close to 300$\times$, when both coarse- and fine-grained parallelism are exploited.

Multi-level parallelization of TeraStitcher led to a significant reduction of processing times with no changes in the user interface, and with no additional effort required for the maintenance of code.

Distress is a critical problem in developed societies given its long-term negative effects on physical and mental health. The interest in studying this emotion has notably increased during last years, being electroencephalography (EEG) signals preferred over other physiological variables in this research field. In addition, the non-stationary nature of brain dynamics has impulsed the use of non-linear metrics such as symbolic entropies in brain signal analysis. However, only consecutive samples in a time series have been considered in the scientific literature for entropy computation applied to distress identification. Thus, the influence of time-lag on brain patterns assessment has not been tested. Hence, in the present study two permutation entropies denominated Delayed Permutation Entropy and Permutation Min-Entropy have been computed for the first time at different time-lags to discern between calmness and distress emotional states in EEG signals. Moreover, a number of curve-related features were also calculated to assess the signal dynamics across different temporal intervals.Complementary information among these variables was studied through stepwise regression and ten-fold cross-validation approaches. According to the results obtained, the multi-lag analysis has been able to reveal new significant insights so far undiscovered, thus notably improving the process of distress recognition from EEG recordings.

Heterogeneity of neural properties within a given neural class is ubiquitous in the nervous system and permits different sub-classes of neurons to specialize for specific purposes. This principle has been thoroughly investigated in the hindbrain of the weakly electric fish A. leptorhynchus in the primary electrosensory area, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe (ELL). The pyramidal cells that receive inputs from tuberous electroreceptors are organized in three maps in distinct segments of the ELL. The properties of these cells vary greatly across maps due to differences in connectivity, receptor expression, and ion channel composition. These cells are a seminal example of bursting neurons and their bursting dynamic relies on the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the extensive apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal cells. Other ion channels can affect burst generation and their expression varies across ELL neurons and segments. For example, SK channels cause hyperpolarizing after-potentials decreasing the likelihood of bursting, yet bursting propensity is similar across segments. We question whether the depolarizing mechanism that generates the bursts presents quantitative differences across segments that could counterbalance other differences having the opposite effect. Although their presence and role are established, the distribution and density of the apical dendrites’ Na+ channels have not been quantified and compared across ELL maps. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that Na+ channel density varies across segment by quantifying their distribution in the apical dendrites of immunolabeled ELL sections. We found the Na+ channels to be two-fold denser in the lateral segment than in the centro-medial segment, the centro-lateral segment being intermediate. Our results imply that this differential expression of voltage-gated Na+ channels could counterbalance or interact with other aspects of neuronal physiology that vary across segments (e.g. SK channels). We argue that burst coding of sensory signals, and the way the network regulates bursting, should be influenced by these variations in Na+ channel density.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive tool for detecting brain tissue microstructural alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Abnormal cerebral perfusion patterns have also been reported in PD patients using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. In this study we aimed to perform a combined DTI and ASL assessment in PD patients within the basal ganglia, in order to test the relationship between microstructural and perfusion alterations.
Fifty-two subjects participated in this study. Specifically, twenty-six PD patients (mean age [SD]=66.7[8.9] years, 21 males, median [IQR] Modified Hoehn and Yahr = 1.5 [1-1.6]) and twenty-six healthy controls (HC, mean age [SD]=65.2[7.5], 15 males) were scanned with 1.5T MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) maps were derived from diffusion-weighted images, while cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were computed from ASL data. After registration to Montreal Neurological Institute standard space, FA, MD, AD, RD and CBF median values were extracted within specific regions of interest: substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, globus pallidum, thalamus, red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. DTI measures and CBF were compared between the two groups. The relationship between diffusion parameters and CBF was tested with Spearman’s correlations. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant, while uncorrected p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered a trend.
No significant FA differences were observed. AD was significantly increased in PD patients compared with HC in the putamen (p=0.039, pFDR=0.035). No significant CBF differences were found between PD patients and HC. Diffusion parameters were not significantly correlated with CBF in the HC group, while a significant correlation emerged for PD patients in the caudate nucleus, for all DTI measures (with FA: r=0.543, pFDR=0.028; with MD: r=-0.661, pFDR=0.002; with AD: r=-0.628, pFDR=0.007; with RD: r=-0.635, pFDR=0.003).
This study showed that DTI is a more sensitive technique than ASL to detect alterations in the basal ganglia in the early phase of PD. Our results suggest that, although DTI and ASL convey different information, a relationship between microstructural integrity and perfusion changes in the caudate may be present.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00111">Neurocompensatory Effects of the Default Network in Older Adults</a></h4>

The hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) is a neurocompensatory process that has been observed across several cognitive functions but has not yet been examined in relation to task-induced relative deactivations of the default mode network. The present study investigated the presence of HAROLD effects specific to neural activations and deactivations using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) n-back paradigm.  It was hypothesized that HAROLD effects would be identified in relative activations and deactivations during the paradigm, and that they would be associated with better 2-back performance. Forty-five older adults (M age=63.8; range=53-83) were administered a verbal n-back paradigm during fMRI. For each participant, the volume of brain response was summarized by left and right frontal regions of interest, and laterality indices (LI; i.e., left/right) were calculated to assess HAROLD effects. Group level results indicated that age was significantly and negatively correlated with LI (i.e., reduced left lateralization) for deactivations, but positively correlated with LI (i.e., increased left lateralization) for activations. The relationship between age and LI for deactivation was significantly moderated by performance level, revealing a stronger relationship between age and LI at higher levels of 2-back performance. Findings suggest that older adults may employ neurocompensatory processes specific to deactivations, and task-independent processes may be particularly sensitive to age-related neurocompensation.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Despite accumulating evidence suggesting improvement in one’s well-being as a result of meditation, little is known about if or how the brain and the periphery interact to produce these behavioral and mental changes. We hypothesize that meditation reflects changes in the neural representations of visceral activity, such as cardiac behavior, and investigated the integration of neural and visceral systems and the spontaneous whole brain spatiotemporal dynamics underlying traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation. In a large cohort of long-term Tibetan Buddhist monk meditation practitioners, we found distinct transient modulations of the neural response to heartbeats in the default mode network (DMN), along with large-scale network reconfigurations in the gamma and theta bands of electroencephalography (EEG) activity induced by meditation. Additionally, temporal-frontal network connectivity in the EEG theta band was negatively correlated with the duration of meditation experience, and gamma oscillations were uniquely, directionally coupled to theta oscillations during meditation. Overall, these data suggest that the neural representation of cardiac activity in the DMN and large-scale spatiotemporal network integrations underlie the fundamental neural mechanism of meditation and further imply that meditation may utilize cortical plasticity, inducing both immediate and long-lasting changes in the intrinsic organization and activity of brain networks.</span>

The relationship between neurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) is attracting attention as a central mechanism controlling brain plasticity. In the cortex, PNNs primarily surround inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons, playing roles as both a regulator of synaptic plasticity and a protective barrier. PNNs have a delayed developmental trajectory and are key components in the closure of critical periods of heightened neuroplasticity. In animal models, manipulating PNNs outside this critical window can enhance cognition, suggesting a potentially therapeutic approach for attenuating cognitive decline.

Reaching movements are dysmetric following cerebellar damage, with unclear etiology. Using closed-loop optogenetic manipulations and single-unit recordings in mice, Becker and Person show that the cerebellar interposed nucleus adaptively decelerates the limb to support reach endpoint precision and accuracy.

In this Perspective we explore filopodia of endothelial cells in the developing central nervous system using the Golgi method and transmission electron microscopy. Filopodia of endothelial cells play a crucial role in the anastomosis of growing capillaries of the central nervous system. The leading endothelial cells filopodia from approaching capillaries interconnect forming complex conglomerates that precede the anastomotic event. The contacting filopodia form narrow spaces between them filled with proteinaceous basal lamina material. The original narrow spaces coalesce into larger ones leading to the formation of a single one that will interconnect (anastomose) the two approaching capillaries. The four leading endothelial cells (two for each approaching capillary) become the wall of the newly formed post-anastomotic CNS capillaries. These new CNS capillaries are very small with narrow and irregular lumina that might permit the passage of fluid but not yet of blood cells. Eventually, their lumen enlarges and permits the passage of blood cells.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Distributed neural dysconnectivity is considered a hallmark feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), yet a tension exists between studies pinpointing focal disruptions versus those implicating brain-wide disturbances. The cerebellum and the striatum communicate reciprocally with the thalamus and cortex through monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections, forming cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar (CSTC) functional pathways that may be sensitive to brain-wide dysconnectivity in SCZ. It remains unknown if the same pattern of alterations persists across CSTC systems, or if specific alterations exist along key functional elements of these networks. We characterized connectivity along major functional CSTC subdivisions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 159 chronic patients and 162 matched controls. Associative CSTC subdivisions revealed consistent brain-wide bi-directional alterations in patients, marked by hyper-connectivity with sensory-motor cortices and hypo-connectivity with association cortex. Focusing on the cerebellar and striatal components, we validate the effects using data-driven <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>-means clustering of voxel-wise dysconnectivity and support vector machine classifiers. We replicate these results in an independent sample of 202 controls and 145 patients, additionally demonstrating that these neural effects relate to cognitive performance across subjects. Taken together, these results from complementary approaches implicate a consistent motif of brain-wide alterations in CSTC systems in SCZ, calling into question accounts of exclusively focal functional disturbances.</span>

Studies using rewilded laboratory mice have begun to provide important clues into the complex relationship between environment, immunity, and behavior. In a recent paper, Cope and colleagues (Hippocampus, 2019) showed that exposing laboratory mice to outdoor living, either with or without peripheral worm infection, increased adult neurogenesis and had major effects on microglia, but only outdoor living coupled with worm infection increased anxiety.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To provide evidence that early EEG allows for reliable prediction of poor or good outcome after cardiac arrest.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a five‐center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive, comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG recordings were started as soon as possible and continued up to five days. Five‐minute EEG epochs were assessed by two reviewers, independently, at eight predefined time points from 6h to 5 days after cardiac arrest, blinded for patients’ actual condition, treatment, and outcome. EEG‐patterns were categorized as generalized suppression (&lt;10μV), synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression, continuous, or other. Outcome at six months was categorized as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1‐2) or poor (CPC 3‐5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 850 patients, of which 46% had a good outcome. Generalized suppression and synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression predicted poor outcome without false positives at ≥6h after cardiac arrest. Their summed sensitivity was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42‐0.51) at 12h and 0.30 (95%‐CI: 0.26‐0.33) at 24h after cardiac arrest, with specificity 1.00 (95%‐CI: 0.99‐1.00) at both time points. At 36h or later, sensitivity for poor outcome was ≤0.22. Continuous EEG‐patterns at 12h predicted good outcome with sensitivity of 0.50 (95%‐CI: 0.46‐0.55) and specificity of 0.91 (95%‐CI: 0.88‐0.93); at 24h or later, specificity for the prediction of good outcome was &lt;0.90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EEG allows for reliable prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest, with maximum sensitivity in the first 24 hours. Continuous EEG patterns at 12h after cardiac arrest are associated with good recovery.</p>

<h2>
   <span>Abstract</span>
</h2>

<h2>
   <span>Objective</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (COX) deficiency is a major mitochondrial respiratory chain defect that has vast genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. This study aims to identify novel causative genes of COX deficiency with only striated muscle‐specific symptoms.</span></p>


<h2>
   <span>Methods</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Whole exome sequencing was performed in two unrelated individuals who were diagnosed with congenital myopathy and presented COX deficiency in muscle pathology. We assessed the <i>COX6A2</i> variants using measurements of enzymatic activities and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the samples from the patients and knockout mice.</span></p>


<h2>
   <span>Results</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>Both patients presented muscle weakness and hypotonia in four limbs along with facial muscle weakness. One patient had cardiomyopathy. Neither patient exhibited involvement from other organs. Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic missense variants in <i>COX6A2</i>, which is expressed only in the skeletal muscle and heart. The variants detected were homozygous c.117C&gt;A (p.Ser39Arg) and compound heterozygous c.117C&gt;A (p.Ser39Arg) and c.127T&gt;C (p.Cys43Arg). We found specific reductions in complex IV activities in the skeletal muscle of both individuals. Assembly of complex IV and its supercomplex formation were impaired in the muscle.</span></p>


<h2>
   <span>Interpretation</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span>This study indicates that biallelic variants in <i>COX6A2</i> cause a striated muscle‐specific form of COX deficiency.</span></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as age‐related, diagnostic and severity‐associated PD biomarkers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls: 45, PD: 145), followed by analysis of seven polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls: 49, PD: 186, progressive supranuclear palsy: 19, Alzheimer's disease: 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&amp;Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS‐III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined <i>in vitro</i> in various cell lines.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In Cohort A, <i>N</i>8‐acetylspermidine and <i>N</i>‐acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, <i>N</i>1,<i>N</i>8‐diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&amp;Y, UPDRS‐III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH‐SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in five genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism, were detected compared with controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spermine synthesis and <i>N</i>1,<i>N</i>8‐diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity‐associated biomarkers for PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25515?af=R">Sleep‐disordered Breathing and Post‐Stroke Outcomes</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the association between sleep‐disordered breathing and stroke outcomes, and determine the contribution of sleep‐disordered breathing to outcome disparities in Mexican Americans.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke patients (N=995), identified from the population‐based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project (2010‐2015), were offered participation in a sleep‐disordered breathing study including a home sleep apnea test (ApneaLink Plus). Sleep‐disordered breathing (respiratory event index≥10) was determined soon after stroke. Neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes were assessed at 90 days post‐stroke. Regression models were used to assess associations between sleep‐disordered breathing and outcomes, adjusted for socio‐demographics, pre‐stroke function and cognition, health‐risk behaviors, stroke severity, and vascular risk factors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age was 67 years (IQR:59‐78); 62.1% were Mexican American. Median respiratory event index was 14 (IQR:6‐25); 62.8% had sleep‐disordered breathing. Sleep‐disordered breathing was associated with worse functional outcome (mean difference in activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score 0.15, 95% CI:0.01,0.28) and cognitive outcome (mean difference in modified Mini Mental State Examination ‐2.66, 95% CI:‐4.85,‐0.47) but not neurologic or quality of life outcomes. Sleep‐disordered breathing accounted for 9‐10% of ethnic differences in functional and cognitive outcome and was associated with cognitive outcome more strongly for Mexican Americans (β=‐3.97, 95% CI:‐6.63,‐1.31) than non‐Hispanic whites (β=‐0.40, 95% CI:‐4.18,3.39, p‐interaction=0.15).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sleep‐disordered breathing is associated with worse functional and cognitive function at 90 days post‐stroke. These outcomes are reasonable endpoints for future trials of sleep‐disordered breathing treatment in stroke. If effective, sleep‐disordered breathing treatment may somewhat lessen ethnic stroke outcome disparities.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the walls of cortical vessels and the accrual of microbleeds and microinfarcts over time. The relationship between CAA severity and microbleeds and microinfarcts as well as the sequence of events that lead to lesion formation remain poorly understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We scanned intact formalin‐fixed hemispheres of 12 CAA cases with MRI, followed by histopathological examination in pre‐defined areas and serial sectioning in targeted areas with multiple lesions.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total 1,168 cortical microbleeds and 472 cortical microinfarcts were observed on <i>ex vivo</i> MRI. Increasing CAA severity at the whole‐brain or regional level was not associated with the number of microbleeds or microinfarcts. However, locally, the density of Aβ positive cortical vessels was lower surrounding a microbleed compared to a simulated control lesion, and higher surrounding microinfarcts. Serial sectioning revealed that for (n=28) microbleeds both Aβ (4%) and smooth muscle cells (4%) were almost never present in the vessel wall at the site of bleeding, but Aβ was frequently observed upstream or downstream (71%), as was extensive fibrin(ogen) build‐up (87%). In contrast, for (n=22) microinfarcts vascular Aβ was almost always observed at the core of the lesion (91%, p&lt;0.001) as well as upstream or downstream (82%), but few vessels associated with microinfarcts had intact smooth muscle cells (9%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These observations provide a model for how a single neuropathologic process such as CAA may result in hemorrhagic or ischemic brain lesions potentially through two different mechanistic pathways.</p>

Presynaptic boutons support neurotransmitter release with nanoscale precision at sub-millisecond timescales. Studies over the past two decades have revealed a rich tapestry of molecular players governing synaptic vesicle fusion at highly specialized release sites in the active zone (AZ). However, the spatiotemporal organization of release at active synapses remains elusive, in part owing to the extremely small size of the AZ and the limited resolution of conventional approaches. Recent advances in fluorescence nanoscopy have revolutionized direct investigation of presynaptic release organization and dynamics.

Post-translational conjugation of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) peptides to lysine (K) residues on target proteins alters their interactions. SUMOylation of a target protein can either promote its interaction with other proteins that possess SUMO binding domains, or it can prevent target protein interactions that normally occur in the absence of SUMOylation. One subclass of voltage-gated potassium channels that mediates an A-type current, IA, exists as a ternary complex comprising Kv4 pore forming subunits, Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIP) and transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase like proteins (DPPL). SUMOylation could potentially regulate intra- and/or intermolecular interactions within the complex. This study began to test this hypothesis and showed that Kv4.2 channels were SUMOylated in the rat brain and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing a GFP-tagged mouse Kv4.2 channel (Kv4.2g). Prediction software identified two putative SUMOylation sites in the Kv4.2 C-terminus at K437 and K579. These sites were conserved across mouse, rat, and human Kv4.2 channels and across mouse Kv4 isoforms. Increasing Kv4.2g SUMOylation at each site by ~30% produced a significant ~22-50% decrease in IA Gmax, and a ~70-95% increase in channel surface expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of Kv4.2g showed that K437 SUMOylation regulated channel surface expression, while K579 SUMOylation controlled IA Gmax. The K579R mutation mimicked and occluded the SUMOylation-mediated decrease in IA Gmax, suggesting that SUMOylation at K579 blocked an intra- or inter-protein interaction involving K579. The K437R mutation did not obviously alter channel surface expression or biophysical properties, but it did block the SUMOylation-mediated increase in channel surface expression. Interestingly, enhancing K437 SUMOylation in the K579R mutant roughly doubled channel surface expression, but produced no change in IA Gmax, suggesting that the newly inserted channels were electrically silent. This is the first report that Kv4.2 channels are SUMOylated and that SUMOylation can independently regulate Kv4.2 surface expression and IA Gmax in opposing directions. The next step will be to determine if/how SUMOylation affects Kv4 interactions within the ternary complex.

Derived from arachidonic acid (AA), the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) is a substrate for αβ-hydrolase domain 12 (ABHD12). Loss-of-function mutations of ABHD12 are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC). ABHD12 knockout (KO) mice show PHARC-like behaviors in older adulthood. Here, we test the hypothesis that ABHD12 deletion age-dependently regulates bioactive lipids in the CNS. Lipidomics analysis of the brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, striatum and thalamus from male young (3-4 months) and older (7 months) adult ABHD12 KO and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice was performed on over 80 lipids via HPLC/MS/MS, including eCBs, lipoamines, 2-acyl glycerols, free fatty acids, and prostaglandins (PGs). Aging and ABHD12 deletion drove widespread changes in the CNS lipidome; however, the effects of ABHD12 deletion were similar between old and young mice, meaning that many alterations in the lipidome precede PHARC-like symptoms. AA-derived lipids were particularly sensitive to ABHD12 deletion. 2-AG increased in the striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem, whereas the eCB N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine increased in all 8 brain regions, along with at least 2 PGs. Aging also had a widespread effect on the lipidome and more age-related changes in bioactive lipids were found in ABHD12 KO mice than WT suggesting that ABHD12 deletion exacerbates the effects of age. The most robust effects of aging (independent of genotype) across the CNS were decreases in N-acyl GABAs and N-acyl glycines. In conclusion, levels of bioactive lipids are dynamic throughout adulthood and deleting ABHD12 disrupts the wider lipidome, modulating multiple AA-derived lipids with potential consequences for neuropathology.

Among all organs of an adult animal, the central nervous system stands out because of its vast complexity and morphological diversity. During early development, the entire central nervous system develops from an apparently homogenous group of progenitors that differentiate into all neural cell types. Therefore, understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that give rise to the cellular and anatomical diversity of the brain is a key goal of the developmental neurobiology field. With this aim in mind, the development of the central nervous system of model organisms has been extensively studied. From more than a century, the mechanisms of neurogenesis have been studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The visual system comprises one of the major structures of the Drosophila brain. The visual information is collected by the eye-retina photoreceptors and then processed by the four optic lobe ganglia: the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate. The molecular mechanisms that originate neuronal diversity in the optic lobe have been unveiled in the past decade. In this article, we describe the early development and differentiation of the lobula plate ganglion, from the formation of the optic placode and the inner proliferation centre to the specification of motion detection neurons. We focused specifically on how the precise combination of signalling pathways and cell-specific transcription factors patterns the pool of neural stem cells that generates the different neurons of the motion detection system.

In proestrus, the changing gonadal hormone milieu alters the physiological properties of GnRH neurons and contributes to the development of the GnRH surge. We hypothesized that proestrus also influences the expression of different ion channel genes in mouse GnRH neurons. Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling of GnRH neurons collected from intact, proestrous and metestrous GnRH-GFP transgenic mice, respectively. Proestrus changed the expression of 37 ion channel and 8 calcium homeostasis-regulating genes. Voltage-gated sodium channels responded with upregulation of three alpha subunits (Scn2a1, Scn3a and Scn9a). Within the voltage-gated potassium channel class, Kcna1, Kcnd3, Kcnh3 and Kcnq2 were upregulated, while others (Kcna4, Kcnc3, Kcnd2 and Kcng1) underwent downregulation. Proestrus also had impact on inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits manifested in enhanced expression of Kcnj9 and Kcnj10 genes, whereas Kcnj1, Kcnj11 and Kcnj12 subunit genes were downregulated. The two-pore domain potassium channels also showed differential expression with upregulation of Kcnk1 and reduced expression of three subunit genes (Kcnk7, Kcnk12 and Kcnk16). Changes in expression of chloride channels involved both the voltage-gated (Clcn3 and Clcn6) and the intracellular (Clic1) subtypes. Regarding the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, two (Cacna1b and Cacna1h) were upregulated, while Cacna1g showed downregulation. The ancillary subunits were also differentially regulated (Cacna2d1, Cacna2d2, Cacnb1, Cacnb3, Cacnb4, Cacng5, Cacng6 and Cacng8). In addition, ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1) gene was downregulated, while a transient receptor potential cation channel (Trpm3) gene showed enhanced expression. Genes encoding proteins regulating the intracellular calcium homeostasis were also influenced (Calb1, Hpca, Hpcal1, Hpcal4, Cabp7, Cab 39l and Cib2). The differential expression of genes coding for ion channel proteins in GnRH neurons at late proestrus indicates that the altering hormone milieu contributes to remodeling of different kinds of ion channels of GnRH neurons, which might be a prerequisite of enhanced cellular activity of GnRH neurons and the subsequent surge release of the neurohormone.

Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show elevated levels of motor variability that are associated with clinical outcomes. Cortical-cerebellar networks involved in visuomotor control have been implicated in postmortem and anatomical imaging studies of ASD. However, the extent to which these networks show intrinsic functional alterations in patients, and the relationship between intrinsic functional properties of cortical-cerebellar networks and visuomotor impairments in ASD have not yet been clarified. 
Methods: We examined the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of cortical and cerebellar brain regions during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in 23 individuals with ASD and 16 typically developing (TD) controls. Regions of interest (ROIs) with ALFF values significantly associated with motor variability were identified for patients and controls respectively, and their functional connectivity (FC) to each other and the rest of the brain were examined. 
Results: For TD controls, greater ALFF in bilateral cerebellar crus I, left superior temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus and left angular gyrus each were associated with greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar lobule VIII was associated with less visuomotor variability. For individuals with ASD, greater ALFF in right calcarine cortex, right middle temporal gyrus (including MT/V5), left Heschl’s gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left precuneus was related to greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar vermis VI was associated with less visuomotor variability. Individuals with ASD and TD controls did not show differences in ALFF for any of these ROIs. Individuals with ASD showed greater posterior cerebellar connectivity with occipital and parietal cortices relative to TD controls, and reduced FC within cerebellum and between lateral cerebellum and prefrontal and other regions of association cortex. 
Conclusion: Together, these findings suggest that increased resting oscillations within visuomotor networks in ASD are associated with more severe deficits in controlling variability during precision visuomotor behavior. Differences between individuals with ASD and TD controls in the topography of networks showing relationships to visuomotor behavior suggest atypical patterns of cerebellar-cortical specialization and connectivity in ASD that underlies previously documented visuomotor deficits.

Accurate pathological diagnosis of gliomas recurrence is crucial for the optimal management and prognosis prediction. The study here unravels that γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) fluorescence probe imaging in twenty recurrent glioma tissues selectively recognize the most malignant portion from treatment responsive tissues induced by radio/chemo-therapy (Figure 1). The overexpression of GGT in recurrent gliomas and low level in radiation necrosis were validated by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the ki-67 index evaluation demonstrated the significant increase of malignancy aided by GGT-responsive fluorescent probe to screen out the right specimen through fast enhanced imaging of enzyme activity. Importantly, our GGT-targeting probe can be used for accurate determination of pathologic evaluation of tumor malignancy, and eventually for guiding the following management in patients with recurrent.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), both cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism precede the onset of memory deficit and contribute to the disease progression. It is indeed now believed that oxidized cholesterol in the form of oxysterols and altered glucose uptake are main triggers in AD affecting production and clearance of Aβ, and tau phosphorylation. However, only a few studies highlight the relationship between them, suggesting the importance of further extensive studies on this topic.
Recently, a molecular link was demonstrated between cholesterol oxidative metabolism and glucose uptake in the brain. In particular, 27-hydroxycholesterol, a key linker between hypercholesterolemia and the increased AD risk, is considered a biomarker for reduced glucose metabolism. In fact, its excess increases the activity of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain, thus reducing insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which has a major impact on brain functioning. Despite this important evidence regarding the role of this oxysterol in regulating glucose uptake by neurons, the involvement of other cholesterol oxidation products that have been clearly demonstrated to be key players in AD, cannot be ruled out.
This review highlights the current understanding of the potential role of cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism in AD progression, and the bidirectional crosstalk between these two phenomena.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00543">Inhomogeneities in Network Structure and Excitability Govern Initiation and Propagation of Spontaneous Burst Activity</a></h4>

The mesoscale architecture of neuronal networks strongly influences the initiation of spontaneous activity and its pathways of propagation. 
Spontaneous activity has been studied extensively in networks of cultured cortical neurons that generate complex yet reproducible patterns of synchronous bursting events that resemble the activity dynamics in developing neuronal networks in vivo. Synchronous bursts are mostly thought to be triggered at burst initiation sites due to build-up of noise or by highly active neurons, or to reflect reverberating activity that circulates within larger networks, although neither of these has been observed directly. Inferring such collective dynamics in neuronal populations from electrophysiological recordings crucially depends on the spatial resolution and sampling ratio relative to the size of the networks assessed. Using large-scale microelectrode arrays with 1024 electrodes at 0.3 mm pitch that covered the full extent of in vitro networks on about 1 cm2, we investigated where bursts of spontaneous activity arise and how their propagation patterns relate to the regions of origin, the network’s structure, and to the overall distribution of activity. A set of alternating burst initiation zones dominated the initiation of distinct bursting events and triggered specific propagation patterns. Moreover, burst initiation zones were typically located in areas with moderate activity levels, i.e. at transitions between hot and cold spots. The activity-dependent alternation between these zones suggests that the local networks forming the dominating burst initiation zones enter a transient depressed state after several cycles (similar to Eytan et al 2003), allowing other burst initiation zones to take over temporarily. We propose that inhomogeneities in the network structure define such burst initiation zones and that the depletion of local synaptic resources limit repetitive burst initiation.

Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDG-PET are widely researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the state-of-art 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731 Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10% for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.

Many Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients experience hypermetabolism, or an increase in measured versus calculated metabolic rate. The cause of hypermetabolism and the effects on neuronal metabolism in ALS are currently unknown, but the efficacy of dietary interventions shows promise for metabolism as an ALS therapeutic target. The goal of this study is to measure changes in metabolic pathways as a function of disease progression in spinal cords of the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of protein expression for metabolic pathways, antioxidants, chaperones, and proteases in lumbar spinal cord from male SOD1G93A mice at pre-onset, onset, and end-stages of the disease using targeted proteomic analysis. These results reveal that protein content of metabolic proteins including proteins involved in glycolysis, β-oxidation, and mitochondrial metabolism is altered in SOD1G93A mouse spinal cord well before disease onset. The changes in mitochondrial metabolism proteins are associated with decreased maximal respiration and glycolytic flux in SOD1G93A dermal fibroblasts and increased hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxide production in mitochondria from sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle fibers at end stage of disease. Consistent with redox dysregulation, expression of the glutathione antioxidant system is decreased, and peroxiredoxins and catalase expression are increased. In addition, stress response proteases and chaperones, including those involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, are induced before disease onset. In summary, we report that metabolic and stress response changes occur in SOD1G93A lumbar spinal cord before motor symptom onset, and are primarily caused by SOD1G93A expression and do not vary greatly as a function of disease course.

Neurons which fire in a fixed temporal pattern (i.e., ``cell assemblies'') are hypothesized to be a fundamental unit of neural information processing. Several methods are available for the detection of cell assemblies without time structure. However, the systematic detection of cell assemblies with time structure has been challenging, especially in large datasets, due to the lack of efficient methods for handling the time structure. Here, we show a method to detect a variety of cell-assembly activity patterns recurring in noisy neural population activity at multiple timescales. The key innovation is the use of a computer science method for comparing strings (``edit similarity'') to group spikes into assemblies. We validated the method by using artificial data and experimental data, which were previously recorded from the hippocampus of male Long-Evans rats and the prefrontal cortex of male Brown Norway/Fisher hybrid rats. From the hippocampus, we could simultaneously extract place-cell sequences occurring on different timescales during navigation and awake replay. From the prefrontal cortex, we could discover multiple spike sequences of neurons encoding different segments of a goal-directed task. Unlike conventional event-driven statistical approaches, our method detects cell assemblies without creating event-locked averages.  Thus, the method offers a novel analytical tool for deciphering the neural code during arbitrary behavioral and mental processes.

The transmembrane ionic currents that underlie changes in a cell’s membrane potential give rise to electric fields in the extracellular space. In the context of brain activity, these electric fields form the basis for extracellularly recorded signals such as multiunit activity, local field potentials and electroencephalograms. Understanding the underlying neuronal dynamics and localizing current sources using these signals is often challenging, and therefore effective computational modeling approaches are critical. Typically, the electric fields from neural activity are modeled in a post-hoc form, i.e. a traditional neuronal model is used to first generate the membrane currents, which in turn are then used to calculate the electric fields. When the conductivity of the extracellular space is high, the electric fields are weak, and therefore treating membrane currents and electric fields separately is justified. However, in brain regions of lower conductivity, extracellular fields can feed back and significantly influence the underlying transmembrane currents and dynamics of nearby neurons – this is often referred to as ephaptic coupling. The closed-loop nature of ephaptic coupling cannot be modeled using the post-hoc approaches implemented by existing software tools; instead, electric fields and neuronal dynamics must be solved simultaneously. To this end, we have developed a generalized modeling toolbox for studying ephaptic coupling in compartmental neuron models: ELFENN (ELectric Field Effects in Neural Networks). In open loop conditions, we validate the separate components of ELFENN for modeling membrane dynamics and associated field potentials against standard approaches (NEURON and LFPy). Unlike standard approaches however, ELFENN enables the closed-loop condition to be modeled as well, in that the field potentials can feed back and influence membrane dynamics. As an example closed-loop case, we use ELFENN to study phase-locking of action potentials generated by a population of axons running parallel in a bundle. Being able to efficiently explore ephaptic coupling from a computational perspective using tools such as ELFENN will allow us to better understand the physical basis of electric fields in the brain, as well as the conditions in which these fields may influence neuronal dynamics in general.

We studied the cellular organization of the piriform network (comprising the piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus) of the ferret (Mustela putorius) -a highly excitable region prone to seizures- and, more specifically, the distribution and morphology of different types of GABAergic neurons, and the distribution and ratio of glutamatergic and GABAergic boutons, and we compared our findings to those in primary visual area 17, and secondary areas 18 and 19. We accomplished this by using cytochrome oxidase and immunohistochemistry for mature neuronal nuclei (NeuN), GABAergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase-67, calretinin and parvalbumin), and for excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter 1; VGluT1) and inhibitory (vesicular GABA transporter; VGAT) boutons. In the ferret, the cellular organization of the piriform network is similar to that described in other species such as cats, rats and opossums although some differences also exist. GABAergic immunolabeling showed similarities between cortical layers I-III of the piriform cortex and visual areas, such as the relative distribution of GABAergic neurons and the density and area of VGluT1- and VGAT-immunoreactive boutons. However, multiple differences between the piriform network and visual areas (layers I-VI) were found, such as the percentage of GABAergic neurons with respect to the total number of neurons and the ratio of VGluT1- and VGAT-immunoreactive boutons. These findings are relevant to better understand the high excitability of the piriform network.

The claustrum is a subcortical nucleus that exhibits dense connectivity across the neocortex. Considerable recent progress has been made in establishing its genetic and anatomical characteristics, however a core, contentious issue that regularly presents in the literature pertains to the rostral extent of its anatomical boundary. The present study addressed this issue in the rat brain.
Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and  neuroanatomical tract tracing, we have examined the expression profiles of several genes that have previously been identified as exhibiting a differential expression profile in the claustrum relative to the surrounding cortex. The expression profiles of parvalbumin (PV), crystallin mu (Crym), and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma 2 (Gng2) were assessed immunohistochemically alongside, or in combination with cortical anterograde, or retrograde tracer injections. Retrograde tracer injections into various thalamic nuclei were used to further establish the rostral border of the claustrum. 
Expression of all three markers delineated a nuclear boundary that extended considerably (~500 µm) beyond the anterior horn of the neostriatum. Cortical retrograde and anterograde tracer injections, respectively, revealed distributions of cortically-projecting claustral neurons and cortical efferent inputs to the claustrum that overlapped with the gene marker-derived claustrum boundary. Finally, retrograde tracer injections into the thalamus revealed insular cortico-thalamic projections encapsulating a claustral area with strongly diminished cell label, that extended rostral to the striatum.

Along with rapid global population aging, the age-related cognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia have posed a serious threat to public health, health care system, and sustainable economic and societal development of all countries. In this narrative review, we seek to summarize the major epidemiological studies from the life-course perspective that investigate the influence of genetic susceptibility (e.g., APOE ε4 allele and BDNF) and intellectual or psychosocial factors (e.g., educational attainments and leisure activities) as well as their interactions on cognitive phenotypes in aging. Numerous population-based studies have suggested that early-life educational attainments and socioeconomic status, midlife work complexity and social engagements, late-life leisure activities (social, physical, and mentally-stimulating activities), certain personality traits (e.g., high neuroticism and low conscientiousness), and depression significantly affect late-life cognitive phenotypes. Furthermore, certain intellectual or psychosocial factors (e.g., leisure activities and depression) may interact with genetic susceptibility (e.g., APOE ε4 allele) to affect the phenotypes of cognitive aging such that risk or beneficial effects of these factors on cognitive function may vary by carrying the susceptibility genes. The cognitive reserve hypothesis has been proposed to partly explain the beneficial effects of lifetime intellectual and psychosocial factors on late-life cognitive function. This implies that, from a life-course perspective, preventive intervention strategies targeting those modifiable intellectual or psychosocial factors could interfere with clinical expression of the cognitive phenotypes in aging and delay the onset of dementia syndrome, and thus, may help achieve healthy brain aging.

Aging is associated with a decline in a wide range of cognitive functions and working memory (WM) deterioration is considered a main factor contributing to this. Therefore, any attempt to counteract WM decline seems to have a potential benefit for older adults. However, determination of whether such methods like WM trainings are effective is a subject of a serious debate in the literature. Despite a substantial number of training studies and several meta-analyses, there is no agreement on the matter of their effectiveness. The other important and still not fully explored issue is the impact of the preexisting level of intellectual functioning on the training’s outcome. In our study we investigated the impact of WM training on variety of cognitive tasks performance among older adults and the impact of the initial WM capacity (WMC) on the training efficiency. 85 healthy older adults (55-81 years of age; 55 female, 30 males) received five weeks of training on adaptive dual N-back task (experimental group) or memory quiz (active controls). Cognitive performance was assessed before and after intervention with measures of WM, memory updating, inhibition, attention shifting, short-term memory (STM) and reasoning. We found post-intervention group independent improvements across all cognitive tests except for inhibition and STM. With multi-level analysis individual learning curves were modeled, which enabled examining of the intra-individual change in training and inter-individual differences in intra-individual changes. We observed a systematic and positive, but relatively small, learning trend with time. Moderator analyses with demographic characteristics as moderators showed no additional effects on learning curves.  Only initial WMC level was a significant moderator of training effectiveness. Older adults with initially lower WMC improved less and reached lower levels of performance, compared to the group with higher WMC. Overall, our findings are in accordance with the research suggesting that post-training gains are within reach of older adults. Our data provide evidence supporting the presence of transfer after N-back training in older adults. More importantly, our findings suggest that it is more important to take into account an initial WMC level, rather than demographic characteristics when evaluating WM training in older adults.

Astroglial cells are crucial for central nervous system homeostasis. They undergo complex
morpho-functional changes during aging and in response to hormonal milieu. Ovarian
hormones positively affect different astroglia parameters, including regulation of cell
morphology and release of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. Thus, ovarian
hormone loss during menopause has profound impact in astroglial pathophysilogy and has
been widely associated to the process of brain aging.
Humanin is a secreted mitochondrial-encoded peptide with neuroprotective effects. It has
been localized in several tissues with high metabolic rate and its expression decreases with
age. In the brain, humanin has been localized in glial cells in physiological conditions. We
previously reported that surgical menopause induces hippocampal mitochondrial
dysfunction that mimics an aging phenotype. However, the effect of ovarian hormone
deprivation on humanin expression in this area has not been studied. Also, whether
astrocytes express and release humanin and the regulation of such processes by ovarian
hormones remain elusive. Although humanin has also proven to be beneficial in
ameliorating cognitive impairment induced by different insults, its putative actions on
structural synaptic plasticity have not been fully addressed.
In a model of surgical menopause in rats, we studied hippocampal humanin expression and
localization by RT-qPCR and double immunohistochemistry, respectively. Humanin
production and release and ovarian hormone regulation of such processes were studied in
cultured astrocytes by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Humanin effects on
glutamate-induced structural synaptic alterations were determined in primary cultures of
hippocampal neurons by immunocytochemistry.
Humanin expression was lower in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats and its
immunoreactivity colocalized with astroglial markers. Chronic ovariectomy also promoted
the presence of less complex astrocytes in this area. Ovarian hormones increased humanin
intracellular content and release by cultured astrocytes. Humanin prevented glutamateinduced dendritic atrophy and reduction in puncta number and total puncta area for presynaptic marker synaptophysin in cultured hippocampal neurons.
In conclusion, astroglial functional and morphological alterations induced by chronic
ovariectomy resemble an aging phenotype and could affect astroglial support to neuronal
function by altering synaptic connectivity and functionality. Reduced astroglial-derived
humanin may represent an underlying mechanism for synaptic dysfunction and cognitive
decline after menopause.

Background: Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) were discovered nearly a century ago. This article aims to analyze the research literature landscape associated with MAOs as privileged class of neuronal enzymes (neuroenzymes) with key functions in the processes of neurodegeneration, serving as important biological targets in neuroscience. With the accumulating publications on this topic, we aimed to evaluate the publication and citation performance of the contributors, reveal the popular research themes, and identify its historical roots.
Methods: The electronic database of Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to identify publications related to MAOs, which were analyzed according to their publication year, authorship, institutions, countries/regions, journal title, WoS category, total citation count, and publication type. VOSviewer was utilized to visualize the citation patterns of the words appearing in the titles and abstracts, and author keywords. CRExplorer was utilized to identify seminal references cited by the MAO publications.
Results: The literature analysis was based on 19,854 publications. Most of them were original articles (n = 15,148, 76.3%) and reviews (n = 2,039, 10.3%). The top five WoS categories of the analyzed MAO publications were Pharmacology/Pharmacy (n = 4,664, 23.5%), Neurosciences (n = 4,416, 22.2%), Psychiatry (n = 2,906, 14.6%), Biochemistry/Molecular Biology (n = 2,691, 13.6%), and Clinical Neurology (n = 1,754, 8.8%). The top ten institutions are scattered in the United States, UK, France, Sweden, Canada, Israel, and Russia, while the top ten countries/regions with the most intensive research on the field of MAOs are the United States, followed by European and Asian countries. More highly cited publications generally involved neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, as well as the MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and clorgyline, and the irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline.
Conclusion: Through decades of research, the literature has accumulated many publications investigating the therapeutic effects of MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) on various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. We envision that MAO literature will continue to grow steadily, with more new therapeutic candidates being tested for better management of neurological conditions, in particular, with the development of multi-target acting drugs against neurodegenerative diseases.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins is a central paradigm in neurodegeneration. Because of the key role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in regulating protein homeostasis, in the last decade multiple reports implicated this organelle in the progression of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses. In PD, dopaminergic neuron loss or more broadly neurodegeneration has been improved by overexpression of genes involved in the ER stress response. In addition, toxic alpha-synuclein (αS), the main constituent of proteinacious aggregates found in tissue samples of PD patients, has been shown to cause ER stress by altering intracellular protein traffic, synaptic vesicles transport and Ca2+ homeostasis. In this review, we will be summarizing evidence correlating impaired ER functionality to PD pathogenesis, focusing our attention on how toxic, aggregated αS can promote ER stress and cell death.

The cross-regional neurons in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamus regulate the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, in a sleep–wake cycle-dependent manner. A characteristic brain wave, called slow wave, of about 1 Hz is observed during non-REM sleep, and the sleep homeostasis hypothesis proposes that the synaptic connection of a neural network is weakened during sleep. In the present study, in in vitro human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, we investigated the responses to the neuromodulator known to be involved in sleep–wake regulation. We also determined whether long-term depression (LTD)-like phenomena could be induced by 1 Hz low-frequency stimulation (LFS), which is within the range of the non-REM sleep slow wave. A dose-dependent increase was observed in the number of synchronized burst firings (SBFs) when 0.1–1000 nM of serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, orexin, or noradrenaline, all with increased extracellular levels during wakefulness, was administered to hiPSC-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The number of SBFs repeatedly increased up to 5 hours after 100 nM serotonin administration, inducing a 24-h rhythm cycle. Next, in human iPSC-derived glutamate neurons, 1 Hz LFS was administered four times for 15 min every 90 min. A significant reduction in both the number of firings and SBFs was observed in the 15 minutes immediately after LFS. Decreased frequency of spontaneous activity and recovery over time were repeatedly observed. Furthermore, we found that LFS attenuates synaptic connections, and particularly attenuates the strong connections in the neuronal network, and does not cause uniform attenuation. These results suggest sleep–wake states can be mimicked by cyclic neuromodulator administration and show that LTD-like phenomena can be induced by LFS in in vitro human iPSC-derived neurons. These results could be applied in studies on the mechanism of slow waves during sleep or in an in vitro drug efficacy evaluation depending on sleep–wake state.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00550">Different Dopaminergic Dysfunctions Underlying Parkinsonian Akinesia and Tremor</a></h4>

Although the occurrence of Parkinsonian akinesia and tremor is traditionally associated to dopaminergic degeneration, the multifaceted neural processes that cause these impairments are not fully understood. As a consequence, current dopamine medications cannot be tailored to the specific dysfunctions of patients with the result that generic drug therapies produce different effects on akinesia and tremor. This article proposes a computational model focusing on the role of dopamine impairments in the occurrence of akinesia and resting tremor. The model has three key features, to date never integrated in a single computational system: (a) an architecture constrained on the basis of the relevant known system-level anatomy of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops; (b) spiking neurons with physiologically-constrained parameters; (c) a detailed simulation of the effects of both phasic and tonic dopamine release. The model exhibits a neural dynamics compatible with that recorded in the brain of primates and humans. Moreover, it suggests that akinesia might involve both tonic and phasic dopamine dysregulations whereas resting tremor might be primarily caused by impairments involving tonic dopamine release and the responsiveness of dopamine receptors. These results could lead to develop new therapies based on a system-level view of the Parkinson's disease and targeting phasic and tonic dopamine in differential ways.

Compensatory vascular mechanisms can restore cerebral blood flow but fail to protect against chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is known as a vasodilator to protect against ischemic injury in animal models, but its protective role in CCH remains unclear. To determine the effect of PGE1 on cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive functions in CCH, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) was used to mimic CCH in rats, which were subsequently intravenously injected with PGE1 daily for 2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging, immunofluorescence staining and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF), angiogenesis, and cognitive functions, respectively. We found that PGE1 treatment significantly restored CBF by enhancing vertebral artery dilation. In addition, PGE1 treatment increased the number of microvascular endothelial cells and neuronal cells in the hippocampus, and decreased the numbers of astrocyte and apoptotic cells. In the MWM test, we further showed that the escape latency of CCH rats was significantly reduced after PGE1 treatment. Our results suggest that PGE1 ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in CCH rats by enhancing CBF recovery, sustaining angiogenesis, and reducing astrocyte activation and neuronal loss.

The current clinical investigation examined high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) as a focal, non-invasive, anti-epileptic treatment in a child with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. We investigated the clinical impact of repetitive (20 daily sessions) cathode-centered 4x1 HD-tDCS (1 mA, 20 minutes, 4 cm ring radius) over the dominant seizure-generating cortical zone in a 40-month old child suffering from a severe neonatal epileptic syndrome known as Ohtahara syndrome (OS). Seizures and epileptiform activity were monitored and quantified using video-EEG over multiple days of baseline, intervention, and post intervention periods. Primary outcome measures were changes in seizure frequency and duration on the last day of intervention versus the last baseline day, preceding the intervention. In particular, we examined changes in tonic spasms, tonic-myoclonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures from baseline to post-intervention. A trend in tonic-myoclonic seizure (TM-S) frequency was observed indicating a reduction of 73% in TM-S frequency, which was non-significant (t(4) = 2.05, p = 0.1), and denoted a clinically significant change. Myoclonic seizure (M-S) frequency was significantly reduced (t(4) = 3.83, p = 0.019) by 68.42%, compared to baseline, and indicated a significant clinical change as well. A 73% decrease in interictal epileptic discharges (IED) frequency was also observed immediately after the intervention period, compared to IED frequency at three days prior to intervention. Post-intervention seizure-related peak delta desynchronization was reduced by 57%. Our findings represent a case-specific significant clinical response, reduction in IED, and change in seizure-related delta activity following the application of HD-tDCS. The clinical outcomes, as noted in the current study, encourage the further investigation of this focal, non-invasive neuromodulation procedure in other severe electroclinical syndromes (e.g., West syndrome) and in larger pediatric populations diagnosed with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00541">Fibrinogen Chains Intrinsic to the Brain</a></h4>

We observed fine fibrin deposition along the paravascular spaces in naive animals, which increased dramatically following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Following SAH, fibrin deposits in the areas remote from the hemorrhage. Traditionally it is thought that fibrinogen enters subarachnoid space through damaged blood brain barrier. However, deposition of fibrin remotely from hemorrhage suggests that fibrinogen chains Aα, Bβ and  can originate in the brain. Here we demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that astroglia and neurons are capable of expression of fibrinogen chains.
SAH in mice was induced by the filament perforation of the circle of Willis. Four days after SAH animals were anesthetized, transcardially perfused and fixed. Whole brain was processed for immunofluorescent (IF) analysis of fibrin deposition on the brain surface or in brains slices processed for fibrinogen chains Aα, Bβ,  immunohistochemical detection.
Normal human astrocytes were grown media to confluency and stimulated with NOC-18 (100 μM), TNF-α (100 nM), ATP--S (100 µM) for 24 hours. Culture was fixed and washed/permeabilized with 0.1% Triton and processed for IF.
Four days following SAH fibrinogen chains Aα IF associated with glia limitans and superficial brain layers increased 3.2 and 2.5 times (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01) on the ventral and dorsal brain surfaces respectively; fibrinogen chains Bβ increased by 3 times (p&lt;0.01) on the dorsal surface and fibrinogen chain  increased by 3 times (p&lt;0.01) on the ventral surface compared to sham animals. 
Human cultured astrocytes and neurons constitutively expressed all three fibrinogen chains. Their expression changed differentially when exposed for 24 hours to biologically significant stimuli: TNFα, NO or ATP. Western blot and RT-qPCR confirmed presence of the products of the appropriate molecular weight and respective mRNA.
We demonstrate for the first time that mouse and human astrocytes and neurons express fibrinogen chains suggesting potential presence of endogenous to the brain fibrinogen chains differentially changing to biologically significant stimuli. SAH is followed by increased expression of fibrinogen chains associated with glia limitans remote from the hemorrhage. We conclude that brain astrocytes and neurons are capable of production of fibrinogen chains, which may be involved in various normal and pathological processes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00526">How Do Price and Quantity Promotions Affect Hedonic Purchases? An ERPs Study</a></h4>

Due to consuming hedonic products unnecessary to basic well-being, consumers need justifications for pleasure. However, different justifications have differential influences in promotion of hedonic purchases, such as price and quantity promotions (PP and QP), the difference between which is that the latter requires purchasing additional units to get the same discount as the former. In the present study, even-related potentials (ERPs) was applied to revealing timing of brain activities for further understand of how promotion information consisted of promotion type (PP and QP) and discount depth, deep and shallow discounts (DD and SD) on hedonic products was processed. Behaviorally, consumers were more willing to purchase items in PP and DD conditions than QP and SD conditions respectively, and spent more time making final purchase decision in QP and DD condition or PP and SD condition compared to PP and DD condition. Neurophysiologically, DD recruited automatically attentional resources than SD and led a higher P2 amplitude. QP and DD condition or PP and SD condition evoked a larger N2 amplitude and enhanced perceptual conflict compared to PP and DD condition. During late stage, PP and DD elicited a more positive LPP amplitude in contrast to QP and SD respectively, indicating that people have stronger purchase intention and positive affect in PP and DD contexts. These findings provided evidence for the differential influences between PP and QP and what ultimately made consumers buy hedonic products or not.

Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging non-invasively measures cerebral perfusion, which describes the blood's passage through the brain's vascular network. Therefore it is widely used to assess cerebral ischaemia. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) constitute the state-of-the-art method in automatic pattern recognition and hence, in segmentation tasks. But none of the CNN architectures developed to date have achieved high accuracy when segmenting ischaemic stroke lesions, being the main reasons their heterogeneity in location, shape, size, image intensity and texture, especially in this imaging modality.  We use a freely available CNN framework, developed for MR imaging lesion segmentation, as core algorithm to evaluate the impact of enhanced machine learning techniques, namely data augmentation, transfer learning and post-processing, in the segmentation of stroke lesions using the ISLES 2017 dataset, which contains expert annotated diffusion-weighted perfusion and diffusion brain MRI of 43 stroke patients. Of all the techniques evaluated, data augmentation with binary closing achieved the best results, improving the mean Dice score in 17\% over the baseline model. Consistent with previous works, better performance was obtained in the presence of large lesions.

Introduction: With an ageing population there is an important need for the development of effective treatments for the amelioration of cognitive decline. Multiple mechanisms underlie age-related cognitive decline including cerebrovascular disease, oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction.  CoQ10 is a novel treatment which has the potential to improve brain function in healthy elderly populations due to established beneficial effects on mitochondrial function, vascular function and oxidative stress.  Methods and Analysis: We describe the protocol for a 90-day randomized controlled trial which examines the efficacy of Ubiquinol (200mg/day) versus placebo for the amelioration of cognitive decline in a healthy (non-demented) elderly sample, aged 60 years and over.  The primary outcome is the effect of Ubiquinol at 90-days compared to baseline on CogTrack composite measures of cognition.  Additional cognitive measures, as well as measures of cardiovascular function, oxidative stress, liver function and mood will also be monitored across 30-, 60- and 90- day time points. Data analyses will involve repeated measures analysis of variance. Discussion: This study will be the first of its kind to provide important clinical and mechanistic data regarding the efficacy of Ubiquinol as a treatment for age-related cognitive decline in the healthy elderly with important implications for productivity and quality of life within this age group. Ethics and Dissemination: The study has been approved by the institutional ethics committee and all participants will provide written informed consent. Additionally, the trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN12618001841268).

Goodman, Azad Bonni</p><div><p>Precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression is essential for brain development. Besides DNA sequence-specific transcription factors, epigenetic factors play an integral role in the control of gene expression in neurons. Among epigenetic mechanisms, chromatin remodeling enzymes have emerged as essential to the control of neural circuit assembly and function in the brain. Here, we review recent studies on the roles and mechanisms of the chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding (Chd) family of chromatin remodeling enzymes in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity in the mammalian brain. We explore the field through the lens of Chd3, Chd4, and Chd5 proteins, which incorporate into the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and the related proteins Chd7 and Chd8, implicated in the pathogenesis of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. These studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate neuronal connectivity in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders of cognition.</p></div>

The images projected onto the retina can vary widely for a single object. Despite these transformations primates can quickly and reliably recognize objects. At the neural level, transformation tolerance in monkey inferotemporal cortex is affected by the temporal contiguity statistics of the visual input. Here we investigated whether temporal contiguity learning also influences the basic feature detectors in lower levels of the visual hierarchy, in particular the independent coding of orientation and spatial frequency (SF) in primary visual cortex. Eight male Long Evans rats were repeatedly exposed to a temporal transition between two gratings that changed in SF and had either the same (control SF) or a different (swap SF) orientation. Electrophysiological evidence showed that the responses of single neurons during this exposure were sensitive to the change in orientation. Nevertheless, the tolerance of orientation selectivity for changes in SF was unaffected by the temporal contiguity manipulation, as observed in 239 single neurons isolated pre-exposure and 234 post-exposure. Temporal contiguity learning did not affect orientation selectivity in V1. The basic filter mechanisms that characterize V1 processing seem unaffected by temporal contiguity manipulations.

Signaling through bioactive lipids regulates nervous system development and functions. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a membrane-derived lipid mediator particularly enriched in brain, is able to induce many responses in neurons and glial cells by affecting key processes like synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, differentiation and proliferation. Early studies noted sustained elevations of neuronal intracellular calcium, a primary response to LPA exposure, suggesting functional modifications of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. However, the crosstalk between LPA signaling and glutamatergic transmission has only recently been shown. Stimulation of presynaptic LPA receptors in hippocampal neurons regulates glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal, while excess of LPA signaling results in overexcitation and hippocampal epilepsy. Further evidences indicating a role of LPA in the modulation of neuronal transmission has been inferred from animal models with deficits on LPA receptors, mainly LPA1 which is the most prevalent receptor in human and mouse brain tissue. LPA1 null-mice exhibit cognitive and attention deficits characteristic of schizophrenia which are related with altered glutamatergic transmission and reduced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, silencing of LPA1 receptor in mice induced a severe down-regulation of the main glutaminase isoform (GLS) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, along with a parallel sharp decrease on active matrix-metalloproteinase 9. The downregulation of both enzymes correlated with an altered morphology of glutamatergic pyramidal cells dendritic spines towards a less mature phenotype, indicating important implications of LPA in synaptic excitatory plasticity which may contribute to the cognitive and memory deficits shown by LPA1-deficient mice. In this review, we present an updated account of current evidences pointing to important implications of LPA in the modulation of synaptic excitatory transmission.

Fragile Syndrome X (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. It is produced by mutation of the Fmr1 gene that encodes for the Fragile Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an important RNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of multiple proteins located in neuronal synapses. Individuals with FXS exhibit abnormal sensory information processing frequently leading to hypersensitivity across sensory modalities and consequently a wide array of behavioral symptoms.  Insects and mammals engage primarily their sense of smell to create proper representations of the external world and guide adequate decision-making processes. This feature in combination with the exquisitely organized neuronal circuits found throughout the olfactory system and the wide expression of FMRP in brain regions that process olfactory information makes it an ideal model to study sensory alterations in FXS models. In the last decade several groups have taken advantage of these features and have used the olfactory system of fruit fly and rodents to understand neuronal alteration giving rise to sensory perception issues. In this review we will discuss molecular, morphological and physiological aspects of the olfactory information processing in FXS models. We will highlight the decreased inhibitory/excitatory synaptic balance and the diminished synaptic plasticity found in this system resulting in behavioral alteration of individuals in the presence of odorant stimuli.

Early life experiences program lifelong responses to stress. In agreement, resilience and vulnerability to psychopathologies, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have been suggested to depend on the early background. New therapies have targeted memory reconsolidation as a strategy to modify the emotional valence of traumatic memories. Here, we used animal models to study the molecular mechanism through which early experiences may later affect aversive memory reconsolidation. Handling (H) – separation of pups from dams for 10 minutes - or maternal separation (MS) – 3-hour separation - were performed from PDN1-10, using non-handled (NH) litters as controls. Adult males were trained in a contextual fear conditioning task; 24 hours later, a short reactivation session was conducted in the conditioned or in a novel context, followed by administration of midazolam 3 mg/kg i.p. (mdz), known to disturb reconsolidation, or vehicle; a test session was performed 24 hours after. The immunocontent of relevant proteins was studied 15 and 60 minutes after memory reactivation in the dorsal hippocampus (dHc) and basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Mdz-treated controls (NH) showed decreased freezing to the conditioned context, consistent with reconsolidation impairment, but H and MS were resistant to labilization. Additionally, MS males showed increased freezing to the novel context, suggesting fear generalization; H rats showed lower freezing than the other groups, in accordance with previous suggestions of reduced emotionality facing adversities. Increased levels of Zif268, GluN2B, β-actin and polyubiquitination found in the BLA of all groups suggest that memory reconsolidation was triggered. In the dHc, only NH showed increased Zif268 levels after memory retrieval; also, a delay in ERK1/2 activation was found in H and MS animals. We showed here that reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is insensitive to interference by a GABAergic drug in adult male rats exposed to different neonatal experiences; surprisingly, we found no differences in the reconsolidation process in the BLA, but the dHc appears to suffer temporal desynchronization in the engagement of reconsolidation. Our results support a hippocampal-dependent mechanism for reconsolidation resistance in models of early experiences, which aligns with current hypotheses for the etiology of PTSD.

Brain cells normally respond adaptively to the oxidative stress or bioenergetic challenges, resulting from ongoing activity in neuronal circuits. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, these mechanisms are compromised. In fact, neurons show unique age-related changes in function and metabolism, resulting in greater susceptibility to insults and diseases. Aging affects the cells in the nervous system much as do cells in other organ systems. More precisely, as the nervous system ages, neuron metabolism may change, inducing glucose hypometabolism, impaired transport of critical substrates underlying metabolism, alterations in calcium signalling, mitochondrial dysfunction and so on. Moreover, in neuronal aging an accumulation of dysfunctional and aggregated proteins and mitochondria is observed, as a result of an oxidative imbalance: reduced antioxidant defenses and/or increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These changes lead to greater vulnerability of neurons in various regions of the brain and increasing susceptibility to various diseases. In particular, in this review we will focus on neuronal cell rearrangement during aging, in response to changes in metabolism and oxidative stress.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Resulting inflammatory mechanisms after reperfusion (removal of the thrombus) result in cytokine activation, calcium influx, and leukocytic infiltration to the area of ischemia. In particular, leukocytes migrate toward areas of inflammation by use of integrins, particularly integrins B1 and B2. Integrins have been shown to be necessary for leukocyte adhesion and migration, and thus are of immediate interest in many inflammatory diseases, including ischemic stroke. In this review, we identify the main integrins involved in leukocytic migration following stroke (aLb2, aDb2, a4b1, and a5b1) and targeted clinical therapeutic interventions.

Herpes zoster (HZ) can cause a blistering skin rash with severe neuropathic pain. Pharmacotherapy is the most common treatment for HZ patients. However, most of these patients are the elderly and immunocompromised, thus often suffering from side effects and easily getting intractable post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) if medication fails. It is challenging for clinicians to tailor treatment for patients, due to the lack of prognosis information regarding neurological pathogenesis underlying HZ. In the current study, we aimed at characterizing the brain structural pattern of HZ before medication treatment that could help predict medication responses. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 14 right-handed HZ patients (aged 61.0±7.0, 8 males) with poor response and 15 (aged 62.6±8.3, 5 males) age- (p = 0.58), gender-matched (p = 0.20) patients responding well were acquired and analyzed. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) with searchlight algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) was applied to identify the spatial pattern of gray matter (GM) volume with high predicting accuracy. The predictive regions with accuracy higher than 79% located within the cerebellum, posterior insular cortex (pIC), middle and orbital frontal lobes (mFC, OFC), anterior and middle cingulum (ACC, MCC), precuneus (PCu) and cuneus. Among these regions, mFC, pIC and MCC displayed significant increases of GM volumes in patients with poor response than those with good response. Combination of sMRI and MVPA might be a useful tool to explore the neuroanatomical imaging biomarkers of HZ-related pain associating with medication responses.

Improving the long-term performance of neural electrode interfaces requires overcoming severe biological reactions such as neuronal cell death, glial cell activation, and vascular damage in the presence of implanted intracortical devices. Past studies traditionally observe neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and blood-brain barrier disruption around inserted microelectrode arrays. However, analysis of these factors alone yields poor correlation between tissue inflammation and device performance. Additionally, these studies often overlook significant biological responses that can occur during acute implantation injury. The current study employs additional histological markers that provide novel information about neglected tissue components—oligodendrocytes and their myelin structures, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and blood-brain barrier-associated pericytes—during the foreign body response to inserted devices at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days post-insertion. Our results reveal unique temporal and spatial patterns of neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss, axonal and myelin reorganization, glial cell reactivity, and pericyte deficiency both acutely and chronically around implanted devices. Furthermore, probing for immunohistochemical markers that highlight mechanisms of cell death or patterns of proliferation and differentiation have provided new insight into inflammatory tissue dynamics around implanted intracortical electrode arrays.

Today, face biometric systems are becoming widely accepted as a standard method for identity authentication in many security settings. For example, their deployment in automated border control gates plays a crucial role in accurate document authentication and reduced traveller flow rates in congested border zones. The proliferation of such systems is further spurred by the advent of portable devices. On the one hand, modern smartphone and tablet cameras have in-built user authentication applications while on the other hand, their displays are being consistently exploited for face spoofing. Similar to biometric systems of other physiological biometric identifiers, face biometric systems have their own unique set of potential vulnerabilities. In this work, these vulnerabilities (presentation attacks) are being explored via a biologically-inspired presentation attack detection model which is termed ‘BIOPAD’. Our model employs Gabor features in a feedforward hierarchical structure of layers that progressively process and train from visual information of people’s faces, along with their presentation attacks, in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. BIOPAD’s performance is directly compared with other popular biologically-inspired layered models such as the ‘Hierarchical Model And X’ (HMAX) that applies similar handcrafted features, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that discover low-level features through stochastic descent training. BIOPAD shows superior performance to both HMAX and CNN in all of the three presentation attack databases examined and these results were consistent in two different classifiers (Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbour). In certain cases, our findings have shown that BIOPAD can produce authentication rates with 99% accuracy. Finally, we further introduce a new presentation attack database with visible and near-infrared information for direct comparisons. Overall, BIOPAD’s operation, which is to fuse information from different spectral bands at both feature and score levels for the purpose of face presentation attack detection, has never been attempted before with a biologically-inspired algorithm. Obtained detection rates are promising and confirm that near-infrared visual information significantly assists in overcoming presentation attacks.

Many brain regions communicate information through synchronized network activity. Electrical coupling among the dendrites of interneurons in the cortex has been implicated in forming and sustaining such activity in the cortex. Evidence for the existence of electrical coupling among cortical pyramidal cells, however, has been largely absent. A recent experimental study measured properties of electrical connections between  pyramidal cells in the cortex, deemed "electrotonic couplings." These junctions were seen to occur pair-wise, sparsely, and often coexist with electrically-coupled interneurons. Here, we construct a network model to investigate possible roles for these rare, electrotonically-coupled pyramidal-cell pairs. Through simulations, we show that electrical coupling among pyramidal-cell pairs significantly enhances coincidence-detection capabilities and increases network spike-timing precision. Further, a network containing multiple pairs possesses a rich coding structure, exhibiting large variability in its firing pattern.

The mouse primary visual cortex (V1) has become an important brain area for exploring how neural circuits process information. Optogenetic tools have helped to outline the connectivity of a local V1 circuit comprising excitatory pyramidal neurons and several genetically-defined inhibitory interneuron subtypes that express parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide. Optogenetic modulation of individual interneuron subtypes can alter the visual responsiveness of pyramidal neurons with distinct forms of inhibition and disinhibition. However, different interneuron subtypes have potentially opposing actions, and the potency of their effects relative to each other remains unclear. Therefore, in this study we simultaneously optogenetically activated all interneuron subtypes during visual processing to explore whether any single inhibitory effect would predominate. This aggregate interneuron activation consistently inhibited pyramidal neurons in a divisive manner, which was essentially identical to the pattern of inhibition produced by activating parvalbumin-expressing interneurons alone.

Serotonin is an important biogenic amine that acts as a neural circuit modulator.  It is widespread in the central nervous system of insects. However, little is known about the distribution of serotonin in the nervous system of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. In the present study, we performed immunohistochemical experiments with anti-serotonin serum to examine the distribution of serotonin in the central nervous system of H. armigera larvae. We found about 40 serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the brain and about 20 in the gnathal ganglion. Most of these neurons are wide-field neurons giving rise to processes throughout the neuropils of the brain and the gnathal ganglion. In the central brain, serotonin-immunoreactive processes are present bilaterally in the tritocerebrum, the deutocerebrum, and major regions of the protocerebrum, including the central body, lateral accessory lobes, clamps, crepine, superior protocerebrum, and lateral protocerebrum. The central body, anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, and posterior optic tubercle contain extensive serotonin-immunoreactive process terminals. However, the regions of mushroom bodies, the lateral horn, and protocerebral bridges are devoid of serotonin-immunoreactivity. In the gnathal ganglion, the serotonin-immunoreactive processes are also widespread throughout the neuropil, and some process projections extend to the tritocerebrum. Our results provide the first comprehensive description of the serotonergic neuronal network in H. armigera larvae, and they reveal the neural architecture and the distribution of neural substance, allowing us to explor the neural mechanisms of behaviors by using electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches on the target regions.

In this article, we explore a specific controversy about animal experimentation and animal models in the recent history of deep brain stimulation (DBS), and we question its ramifications. DBS development intertwines clinical practice with fundamental research, and stands at the crossroads of multiple legacies. We take up the various issues and controversies embedded in this rarely addressed dispute, from a standpoint that combines socio-anthropological and legal aspects. Our starting point is a debate on the role of animal experimentation in the development of DBS between Jarrod Bailey, a researcher promoting the abolition of animal experimentation, and Alim Louis Benabid, Marwan Hariz, and Mahlon DeLong, three key figures in the area of DBS and neuroscience. By clarifying the positions of the different protagonists and retracing the issues raised in these discussions, our objective is to show how this specific debate has extended from its initial space and how it provides an object of study with heuristic scope. We first present this partially polemic discussion about the history of DBS, and its link with a more general debate on the validity and use of animal models and the need for animal experiments. Then, we raise the issue of the relations and interactions between experiments on animals and on humans in the logics of biomedical innovation. The third step is to situate the discussion within the wider framework of opposition towards animal experimentation and the promotion of animal’ rights. Finally, combining these interweaved issues, possible implications emerge regarding the future of DBS. We show that behind these several controversies lie the question of translational research and the model of medicine upheld by DBS. We describe how the technology contributes to blurring the lines between research (fundamental, preclinical and clinical research) and care, as well as between humans and animals as substrates and objects of knowledge. The dynamics of DBS future development might then become a point of convergence for neuroscientists and animal rights defenders’ interests.

There is increasing evidence indicating that inflammation represents a key pathological component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A possible factor that may contribute to this process is netrin-1, a neuronal guidance molecule. This molecule has been shown to exert an unexpected immunomodulatory function. However, the potential changes and correlations of netrin-1 with T helper 17/regulatory T cells (Th17/Tregs) as related to inflammation in AD has yet to be examined. In this study, netrin-1 and Th17/Tregs balance were investigated, and the relationship among netrin-1, Th17/Tregs and cognitive function were analyzed in a rat model of AD. In this model, a bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of Amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) was used to produce spatial learning and memory deficits, as well as increased neuronal apoptosis, which were detected 7 days after injection for AD7d group and 14 days for AD14d group. Netrin-1 concentrations were significantly down regulated in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these AD rats, effects which were strongly correlated with cognitive deficits.  Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-17 and deceased IL-10 were observed in both the circulation and CSF and were also correlated with the percent of time spent in the target quadrant of AD in these rats. These changes resulted in netrin-1 concentrations being negatively correlated with IL-17 but positively correlated with IL-10 concentrations in the serum and CSF. We also found that the Th17/Tregs balance was disrupted in these AD rats. Collectively, these findings reveal that the reduction in netrin-1 and correlated disruption of Th17/Tregs balance in AD rats, may diminish the immunosuppressive effect of netrin-1 on Th17/Tregs in AD pathogenesis.

In this work, we aim to investigate whether information based metrics of neural activity are a useful tool for the quantification of consciousness before and shortly after birth. Neural activity is measured using fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) in human fetuses and neonates. Based on recent theories on consciousness, information-based metrics are established to measure brain complexity and to assess different levels of consciousness. Different metrics (measures of entropy, compressibility and fractality) are, thus, explored in a reference population and their usability is evaluated. For comparative analysis, two fMEG channels were selected: one where brain activity was previously detected and one at least 15cm away, that represented a control channel. The usability of each metric was evaluated and results from the brain and control channel were compared. Concerning the ease of use with fMEG data, Lempel-Ziv-Complexity (LZC) was evaluated as best, as it is unequivocal and needs low computational effort. The fractality measures have a high number of parameters that need to be adjusted prior to analysis  and therefore forfeit comparability, while entropy measures require a higher computational effort and more parameters to adjust compared to LZC. Comparison of a channel with brain activity and a control channel in neonatal recordings showed significant differences in most complexity metrics. This clear difference can be seen as proof of concept for the usability of complexity metrics in fMEG. For fetal data, this comparison produced less clear results which can be related to leftover maternal signals included in the control channel. Further work is necessary to conclusively interpret results from the analysis of fetal recordings. Yet this study shows that complexity metrics can be used for fMEG data on early consciousness and the evaluation gives a guidance for future work. The inconsistency of results from different metrics highlights the challenges of working with complexity metrics as neural correlates of consciousness, as well as the caution one should apply to interpret them.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor often diagnosed in childhood. Despite intense efforts to develop a successful treatment, current available therapies are still challenged by high rates of resistance, recurrence and progression, most notably in advanced cases and highly malignant tumors. Emerging evidence proposes that this might be due to a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) found in the bulk of the tumor. Therefore, the development of more targeted therapy is highly dependent on the identification of the molecular signatures and genetic aberrations characteristic to this subpopulation of cells. This review aims at providing an overview of the key molecular players involved in NB CSCs and focuses on the experimental evidence from NB cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary tumors. It also provides some novel approaches of targeting multiple drivers governing the stemness of CSCs to achieve better anti-tumor effects than the currently used therapeutic agents.

The advent of optogenetic methods has made it possible to use endogeneously produced molecules to image and manipulate cellular, subcellular and synaptic activity. It has also led to the development of photoactivatable calcium-dependent indicators that mark active synapses, neurons and circuits. Furthermore, calcium-dependent photoactivation can be used to trigger gene expression in active neurons. Here we describe two sets of protocols, one using CaMPARI and a second one using Cal-Light. CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, enables rapid network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping. Cal-Light, a photoactivatable calcium sensor, while slower to respond than CaMPARI, has the capacity to trigger the expression of genes, including effectors, activators, indicators or other constructs. Here we describe the rationale and provide procedures for using these two calcium-dependent constructs (1) in vitro in dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures (CaMPARI &amp; Cal-Light); (2) in vitro in acute brain slices for circuit mapping (CaMPARI); (3) in vivo for triggering photoconversion or gene expression (CaMPARI &amp; Cal-Light); and finally, (4) for recovering photoconverted neurons post-fixation with immunocytochemistry (CaMPARI). The approaches and protocols we describe are examples of the potential uses of both CaMPARI and Cal-Light. The ability to mark and manipulate neurons that are active during specific epochs of behavior has a vast unexplored experimental potential.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00539">Electrical Stimulation of the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Causes a Frequency-Specific BOLD Response Pattern in the Rat Brain</a></h4>

Although deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal cortex has recently shown promise in the treatment of early forms of cognitive decline, the underlying neurophysiological processes remain elusive. Therefore, the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) was stimulated with trains of continuous 5 Hz and 20 Hz pulses or with bursts of 100 Hz pulses to visualize activated neuronal networks, i.e., neuronal responses in the dentate gyrus and BOLD responses in the entire brain were simultaneously recorded.
Electrical stimulation of the LEC caused a wide spread pattern of BOLD responses. Dependent on the stimulation frequency, BOLD responses were only triggered in the amygdala, infralimbic, prelimbic, and dorsal peduncular cortex (5 Hz), or in the nucleus accumbens, piriform cortex, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus (20 Hz), and contralateral entorhinal cortex (100 Hz). In general, LEC stimulation caused stronger BOLD responses in frontal cortex regions than in the hippocampus. Identical stimulation of the perforant pathway, a fiber bundle projecting from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subiculum, mainly elicited significant BOLD responses in the hippocampus but rarely in frontal cortex regions. Consequently, BOLD responses in frontal cortex regions are mediated by direct projections from the LEC rather than via signal propagation through the hippocampus. Thus, the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal cortex on cognitive skills might depend more on an altered prefrontal cortex than hippocampal function.

Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, is important for memory formation and extinction. One of the most studied external interventions that affect the rate of adult neurogenesis is physical exercise. Physical exercise promotes adult neurogenesis via several factors including Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we identified L-lactate, a physical exercise-induced metabolite, as a factor that promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis. While prolonged exposure to L-lactate promoted neurogenesis, no beneficial effect was exerted on cognitive learning and memory. Systemic pharmacological blocking of Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), which transports L-lactate to the brain, prevented lactate-induced neurogenesis, while 3,5-DHBA, an agonist for the lactate-receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), did not affect adult neurogenesis. These data suggest that L-lactate partially mediates the effect of physical exercise on adult neurogenesis, but not cognition, in a MCT2-dependent manner.

Clustering is a powerful machine learning tool for detecting structures in datasets. In the medical field, clustering has been proven to be a powerful tool for discovering patterns and structure in labeled and unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised methods,  clustering is an unsupervised method that works on datasets in which there is no outcome (target) variable nor is anything known about the relationship between the observations, that is, unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on studying and reviewing clustering methods that have been applied to datasets of neurological diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim is to provide insights into which clustering technique is more suitable for partitioning patients of AD based on their similarity. This is important as clustering algorithms can find patterns across patients which are difficult for medical practitioners to find. We further discuss the implications of the use of clustering algorithms in the treatment of AD. We found that clustering analysis can point to several features that underlie the conversion from early-stage AD to advanced AD. Furthermore, future work can apply semi-clustering algorithms on AD datasets, which will enhance clusters by including additional information.

Previous studies have shown that the auditory cortex can enhance the perception of behaviorally important sounds in the presence of background noise, but the mechanisms by which it does this are not yet elucidated. Rapid plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in the primary (A1) cortical neurons is observed during behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This rapid task-related change is believed to be one of the processing strategies utilized by the auditory cortex to selectively attend to one stream of sound in the presence of mixed sounds. However, the mechanism by which the brain evokes this rapid plasticity in the auditory cortex remains unclear. This paper uses a neural network model to investigate mechanisms by which cortical neurons can change their receptive fields. A sound signal was used as input to a model of the cochlea and auditory periphery, which activated or inhibited integrate-and-fire neuron models to represent networks in the primary auditory cortex. Each neuron in the network was tuned to a different frequency. All neurons were interconnected with excitatory or inhibitory synapses of varying strengths. Action potentials in one of the model neurons were used to calculate the receptive field using reverse correlation, which were directly compared to previously recorded electrophysiological data from ferrets performing behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This neural network model could reproduce complex STRFs observed experimentally through optimizing the synaptic drives in the model. The model predicts that altering synaptic drive between cortical neurons can account for rapid task-related changes observed experimentally by A1 neurons. By identifying changes in the synaptic drive during behavioral tasks, the model provides insights into the neural mechanisms utilized by the auditory cortex to enhance the perception of important sounds in the presence of background noise.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00052">The Long View of Language Localization</a></h4>

For British neurologists, one case was considered to represent significant evidence regarding the organization of language in the brain in the second half of the 19th century. The interpretation of its significance was based on repeated standard clinical assessment of behavioral deficits, the use of a psychological model of processing, and lesion localization to inform understanding of clinic-pathological correlation. The aphasic deficits experienced by a single case were observed and recorded by London neurologist Henry Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) over a period of 18 years, and used as a demonstration of clinico-pathological reasoning regarding language function.  This case was well documented in many of Bastian’s publications; presented in teaching demonstrations; included in discussions at medical society meetings and public lectures; and reported widely in the medical press.  When this patient died, the autopsy findings were added to the extensive record of his language deficits. Some aspects of the size and site of the lesion were consistent with Bastian’s clinical predictions arising from his model of language processing, while others presented more of a paradox.  This single case was a significant source of discussion and reflection in the medical community throughout the second half of the 19th century. Examination of various interpretations of this case reveal the assumptions regarding the functional architecture of language processing, and more general theoretical considerations of how evidence from cases of acquired neurogenic aphasia can be employed in developing such models. This long view into a historical case sheds light on the challenges of clinic-pathological correlation methods difficulties in understanding  in the understanding of localization of language functions regarding language processing which remain today.
