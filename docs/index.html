                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Machine Learning-Based Pipette Positional Correction for Automatic Patch Clamp In Vitro</a></h4>

              
                <p>Patch clamp electrophysiology is a common technique used in neuroscience to understand individual neuron behavior, allowing one to record current and voltage changes with superior spatiotemporal resolution compared with most electrophysiology methods. While patch clamp experiments produce high fidelity electrophysiology data, the technique is onerous and labor intensive. Despite the emergence of patch clamp systems that automate key stages in the typical patch clamp procedure, full automation remains elusive. Patch clamp pipettes can miss the target cell during automated experiments because of positioning errors in the robotic manipulators, which can easily exceed the diameter of a neuron. Further, when patching in acute brain slices, the inherent light scattering from non-uniform brain tissue can complicate pipette tip identification. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN), based on ResNet101, to identify and correct pipette positioning errors before each patch clamp attempt, thereby preventing the deleterious effects of and accumulation of positioning errors. This deep-learning-based pipette detection method enabled superior localization of the pipette within 0.62 &plusmn; 0.58 &mu;m, resulting in improved cell detection success rate and whole-cell patch clamp success rates by 71% and 59%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art cross-correlation method. Furthermore, this technique reduced the average time for pipette correction by 81%. This technique enables real-time correction of pipette position during patch clamp experiments with similar accuracy and quality of recording to manual patch clamp, making notable progress toward full human-out-of-the-loop automation for patch clamp electrophysiology.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Generalization of sensorimotor adaptation across limbs, known as interlimb transfer, is a well-demonstrated phenomenon in humans, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Theoretical models suggest that interlimb transfer is mediated by interhemispheric transfer of information via the corpus callosum. We thus hypothesized that lesions of the corpus callosum, especially to its midbody connecting motor, supplementary motor, and premotor areas of the two cerebral hemispheres, would impair interlimb transfer of sensorimotor adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we recruited three patients: two rare stroke patients with recent, extensive callosal lesions including the midbody and one patient with complete agenesis. A prismatic adaptation paradigm involving unconstrained arm reaching movements was designed to assess interlimb transfer from the prism-exposed dominant arm (DA) to the unexposed non-dominant arm (NDA) for each participant. Baseline results showed that spatial performance of each patient did not significantly differ from controls, for both limbs. Further, each patient adapted to the prismatic perturbation, with no significant difference in error reduction compared with controls. Crucially, interlimb transfer was found in each patient. The absolute magnitude of each patient&rsquo;s transfer did not significantly differ from controls. These findings show that sensorimotor adaptation can transfer across limbs despite extensive lesions or complete absence of the corpus callosum. Therefore, callosal pathways connecting homologous motor, premotor, and supplementary motor areas are not necessary for interlimb transfer of prismatic reach adaptation. Such interlimb transfer could be mediated by transcallosal splenium pathways (connecting parietal, temporal and visual areas), ipsilateral cortico-spinal pathways or subcortical structures such as the cerebellum.</p>

                The prevalence of Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is increasing at an alarming rate in the world. Most of the HSV2 cases are not diagnosed properly, although a range of molecular and serological diagnoses exist. Herein, we have reported a very rapid detection method specific for HSV2 using real-time PCR. The primers specific for HSV2 were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool and 120 base pairs of the polymerase gene were amplified using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. The designed primer pair was found highly efficient in detecting only HSV2 DNA, but not HSV1. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for HSV2 reactions by designed primers was found to be an average of 22.55 for a standard copy number of viral DNA that may denote the efficiency of the primers. The melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon using designed primers (82.60C) was also higher than that using reference primers (about 780C), indicating the high GC content of the amplified template. The designed primer pair will help clinicians to detect the HSV2 DNA specifically and diagnose the associated disease rapidly.

                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely adopted affordable method for large scale gene expression profiling. However, user-friendly and versatile tools for wet-lab biologists to analyse RNA-seq data beyond standard analyses such as differential expression, are rare. Especially, the analysis of time-series data is difficult for wet-lab biologists lacking advanced computational training. Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species. With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and mortality reduction. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this article is to review the existing vaccine injury compensation programs in different countries. The review also highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We have identified 27 countries operating vaccine injury compensation programs. In Canada, Quebec is the only province with a scheme; however, discussions are ongoing in Canada for nationwide implementation in light of COVID 19.  Study limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autoencoder based local T cell repertoire density can be used to classify samples and T cell receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shirit Dvorkin, Reut Levi, Yoram Louzoun</p>

Recent advances in T cell repertoire (TCR) sequencing allow for the characterization of repertoire properties, as well as the frequency and sharing of specific TCR. However, there is no efficient measure for the local density of a given TCR. TCRs are often described either through their Complementary Determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, or theirV/J usage, or their clone size. We here show that the local repertoire density can be estimated using a combined representation of these components through distance conserving autoencoders and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). We present ELATE–an Encoder-based LocAl Tcr dEnsity and show that the resulting density of a sample can be used as a novel measure to study repertoire properties. The cross-density between two samples can be used as a similarity matrix to fully characterize samples from the same host. Finally, the same projection in combination with machine learning algorithms can be used to predict TCR-peptide binding through the local density of known TCRs binding a specific target.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernard Cazelles, Clara Champagne, Benjamin Nguyen-Van-Yen, Catherine Comiskey, Elisabeta Vergu, Benjamin Roche</p>

The effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub><i>(t)</i>. Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bridging cell-scale simulations and radiologic images to explain short-time intratumoral oxygen fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica L. Kingsley, James R. Costello, Natarajan Raghunand, Katarzyna A. Rejniak</p>

Radiologic images provide a way to monitor tumor development and its response to therapies in a longitudinal and minimally invasive fashion. However, they operate on a macroscopic scale (average value per voxel) and are not able to capture microscopic scale (cell-level) phenomena. Nevertheless, to examine the causes of frequent fast fluctuations in tissue oxygenation, models simulating individual cells’ behavior are needed. Here, we provide a link between the average data values recorded for radiologic images and the cellular and vascular architecture of the corresponding tissues. Using hybrid agent-based modeling, we generate a set of tissue morphologies capable of reproducing oxygenation levels observed in radiologic images. We then use these in silico tissues to investigate whether oxygen fluctuations can be explained by changes in vascular oxygen supply or by modulations in cellular oxygen absorption. Our studies show that intravascular changes in oxygen supply reproduce the observed fluctuations in tissue oxygenation in all considered regions of interest. However, larger-magnitude fluctuations cannot be recreated by modifications in cellular absorption of oxygen in a biologically feasible manner. Additionally, we develop a procedure to identify plausible tissue morphologies for a given temporal series of average data from radiology images. In future applications, this approach can be used to generate a set of tissues comparable with radiology images and to simulate tumor responses to various anti-cancer treatments at the tissue-scale level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explaining distortions in metacognition with an attractor network model of decision uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadim A. A. Atiya, Quentin J. M. Huys, Raymond J. Dolan, Stephen M. Fleming</p>

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, and evaluate, our cognition and behaviour. Distortions in metacognition are common in mental health disorders, though the neural underpinnings of such dysfunction are unknown. One reason for this is that models of key components of metacognition, such as decision confidence, are generally specified at an algorithmic or process level. While such models can be used to relate brain function to psychopathology, they are difficult to map to a neurobiological mechanism. Here, we develop a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty in an attempt to bridge this gap. We first relate the model’s uncertainty in perceptual decisions to standard metrics of metacognition, namely mean confidence level (bias) and the accuracy of metacognitive judgments (sensitivity). We show that dissociable shifts in metacognition are associated with isolated disturbances at higher-order levels of a circuit associated with self-monitoring, akin to neuropsychological findings that highlight the detrimental effect of prefrontal brain lesions on metacognitive performance. Notably, we are able to account for empirical confidence judgements by fitting the parameters of our biophysical model to first-order performance data, specifically choice and response times. Lastly, in a reanalysis of existing data we show that self-reported mental health symptoms relate to disturbances in an uncertainty-monitoring component of the network. By bridging a gap between a biologically-plausible model of confidence formation and observed disturbances of metacognition in mental health disorders we provide a first step towards mapping theoretical constructs of metacognition onto dynamical models of decision uncertainty. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for modelling metacognitive performance in settings where access to explicit confidence reports is not possible.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dimeric allostery mechanism of the plant circadian clock photoreceptor ZEITLUPE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Francesco Trozzi, Feng Wang, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain containing protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) integrates light quality, intensity, and duration into regulation of the circadian clock. Recent structural and biochemical studies of ZTL indicate that the protein diverges from other members of the LOV superfamily in its allosteric mechanism, and that the divergent allosteric mechanism hinges upon conservation of two signaling residues G46 and V48 that alter dynamic motions of a Gln residue implicated in signal transduction in all LOV proteins. Here, we delineate the allosteric mechanism of ZTL via an integrated computational approach that employs atomistic simulations of wild type and allosteric variants of ZTL in the functional dark and light states, together with Markov state and supervised machine learning classification models. This approach has unveiled key factors of the ZTL allosteric mechanisms, and identified specific interactions and residues implicated in functional allosteric changes. The final results reveal atomic level insights into allosteric mechanisms of ZTL function that operate via a non-trivial combination of population-shift and dynamics-driven allosteric pathways.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insights into substrate recognition and specificity for IgG by Endoglycosidase S2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asaminew H. Aytenfisu, Daniel Deredge, Erik H. Klontz, Jonathan Du, Eric J. Sundberg, Alexander D. MacKerell Jr</p>

Antibodies bind foreign antigens with high affinity and specificity leading to their neutralization and/or clearance by the immune system. The conserved N-glycan on IgG has significant impact on antibody effector function, with the endoglycosidases of <i>Streptococcus pyogen</i>es deglycosylating the IgG to evade the immune system, a process catalyzed by the endoglycosidase EndoS2. Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2 to the proteins’ catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and multi-microsecond MD simulations. Modeling results predict that EndoS2 initially interacts with the IgG through its CBM followed by interactions with the GH yielding catalytically competent states. These may involve the CBM and GH of EndoS2 simultaneously interacting with either the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or individually with the two Fc CH2/CH3 domains, with EndoS2 predicted to assume closed conformations in the former case and open conformations in the latter. Apo EndoS2 is predicted to sample both the open and closed states, suggesting that either complex can directly form following initial IgG-EndoS2 encounter. Interactions of the CBM and GH domains with the IgG are predicted to occur through both its glycan and protein regions. Simulations also predict that the Fc glycan can directly transfer from the CBM to the GH, facilitating formation of catalytically competent complexes and how the 734 to 751 loop on the CBM can facilitate extraction of the glycan away from the Fc CH2/CH3 domain. The predicted models are compared and consistent with Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange data. In addition, the complex models are consistent with the high specificity of EndoS2 for the glycans on IgG supporting the validity of the predicted models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Projecting contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: An update and comparison with empirical data for the COVID-19 era</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kiesha Prem, Kevin van Zandvoort, Petra Klepac, Rosalind M. Eggo, Nicholas G. Davies, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group , Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit</p>

Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IVEN: A quantitative tool to describe 3D cell position and neighbourhood reveals architectural changes in FGF4-treated preimplantation embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica E. Forsyth, Ali H. Al-Anbaki, Roberto de la Fuente, Nikkinder Modare, Diego Perez-Cortes, Isabel Rivera, Rowena Seaton Kelly, Simon Cotter, Berenika Plusa</p>

Architectural changes at the cellular and organism level are integral and necessary to successful development and growth. During mammalian preimplantation development, cells reduce in size and the architecture of the embryo changes significantly. Such changes must be coordinated correctly to ensure continued development of the embryo and, ultimately, a successful pregnancy. However, the nature of such transformations is poorly defined during mammalian preimplantation development. In order to quantitatively describe changes in cell environment and organism architecture, we designed Internal Versus External Neighbourhood (IVEN). IVEN is a user-interactive, open-source pipeline that classifies cells into different populations based on their position and quantifies the number of neighbours of every cell within a dataset in a 3D environment. Through IVEN-driven analyses, we show how transformations in cell environment, defined here as changes in cell neighbourhood, are related to changes in embryo geometry and major developmental events during preimplantation mammalian development. Moreover, we demonstrate that modulation of the FGF pathway alters spatial relations of inner cells and neighbourhood distributions, leading to overall changes in embryo architecture. In conjunction with IVEN-driven analyses, we uncover differences in the dynamic of cell size changes over the preimplantation period and determine that cells within the mammalian embryo initiate growth phase only at the time of implantation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Classification of small ruminant lentivirus subtype A2, subgroups 1 and 2 based on whole genome comparisons and complex recombination patterns [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) cause a multisystemic chronic wasting disease in sheep across much of the world. SRLV subtype A2 is prevalent in North America and further classified into multiple subgroups based on variation in the group antigens gene (gag) and envelope (env) genes. In sheep, the ovine transmembrane protein 154 (TMEM154) gene is associated with SRLV susceptibility. Ewes with at least one copy of TMEM154 encoding a full-length protein with glutamate at position 35 (E35; haplotypes 2 and 3), are highly susceptible to SRLV infection while ewes with any combination of TMEM154 haplotypes which encodes lysine (K35; haplotype 1), or truncated proteins (haplotypes 4 and 6) are several times less so. A2 subgroups 1 and 2 are associated with host TMEM154 genotypes; subgroup 1 with the K35/K35 genotype and subgroup 2 with the E35/E35 genotype. Methods:  Sequence variation within and among full-length assemblies of SRLV subtype A2 subgroups 1 and 2 was analyzed to identify genome-scale recombination patterns and subgroup-specific variants. Results:  Consensus viral genomes were assembled from 23 infected sheep, including animals of assorted TMEM154 genotypes comprised of haplotypes 1, 2, or 3. Viral genome analysis identified viral subgroups 1 and 2 among the samples, and revealed additional sub-structure within subgroup 2 based on models predicting complex patterns of recombination between the two subgroups in several genomes. Animals with evidence of dual subgroup infection also possessed the most diverse quasi-species and the most highly recombined consensus genomes. After accounting for recombination, 413 subgroup diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Conclusions:  The viral subgroup framework developed to classify SRLV consensus genomes along a continuum of recombination suggests that animals with the TMEM154 E35/K35 genotype may represent a reservoir for producing viral genomes representing recombination between A2 subgroups 1 and 2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Entry of antiepileptic drugs (valproate and lamotrigine) into the developing rat brain [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Women with epilepsy face difficult choices whether to continue antiepileptic drug treatment during pregnancy, as uncontrolled seizures carry great risk to mother and fetus but continuing treatment may have adverse effects on baby’s development. This study aimed at evaluating antiepileptic drug entry into developing brain. Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, within clinical range. Injectate included 3H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult and was dose-dependent except at E19; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and 3H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain. Entry of lamotrigine was little different at different ages and was not dose dependent.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As an effective antiviral therapy is not available for the treatment of the current rapidly and continuously spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is very crucial to find an alternative treatment strategy. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used for prevention and treatment of many emerging infectious diseases, however, the results of current studies on CP in COVID-19 are not consistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CP therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while evaluating patient and donor-related factors that might influence the therapeutic outcome. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 312 patients with either severe or critical COVID-19, who were admitted to Al-Hakeem and Al-Amal hospitals in Al-Najaf city, Iraq from June to August 2020.  The patients were allocated to either the plasma therapy group (152 patients) who received CP combined with standard therapy or the standard therapy group (160 patients). The outcome measures were the 21-day mortality rate and time to clinical improvement. Results: The overall cumulative survival rate was significantly higher in patients who received CP compared to standard therapy alone at 21 days (68.3% vs. 46.8%, p-value = 0.010), with mean survival at 17.6 vs. 15.3 days, (p-value = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, the plasma therapy effect was an independent predictor of survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval: 0.368, 0.177 – 0.765). In terms of clinical improvement, the use of CP resulted in shorter clinical improvement (median duration of improvement: 8 vs. 11 days, p-value = 0.007), with 74.3% improvement rate after 21 days in CP compared to 65.0% in standard therapy. Conclusions: Therapy with CP in combination with standard therapy, independently improved survival in hospitalized patient with severe or critical COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Long-term effect of full-body pulsed electromagnetic field and exercise protocol in the treatment of men with osteopenia or osteoporosis: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequence structure organizes items in varied latent states of working memory neural network</a></h4>

              
                In memory experiences, events do not exist independently but are linked with each other via structure-based organization. Structure context largely influences memory behavior, but how it is implemented in the brain remains unknown. Here, we combined magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings, computational modeling, and impulse-response approaches to probe the latent states when subjects held a list of items in working memory (WM). We demonstrate that sequence context reorganizes WM items into distinct latent states, i.e., being reactivated at different latencies during WM retention, and the reactivation profiles further correlate with recency behavior. In contrast, memorizing the same list of items without sequence task requirements weakens the recency effect and elicits comparable neural reactivations. Computational modeling further reveals a dominant function of sequence context, instead of passive memory decaying, in characterizing recency effect. Taken together, sequence structure context shapes the way WM items are stored in the human brain and essentially influences memory behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autoregulatory control of microtubule binding in doublecortin-like kinase 1</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), is highly expressed in a range of cancers and is a prominent therapeutic target for kinase inhibitors. The physiological roles of DCLK1 kinase activity and how it is regulated remain elusive. Here, we analyze the role of mammalian DCLK1 kinase activity in regulating microtubule binding. We find that DCLK1 autophosphorylates a residue within its C-terminal tail to restrict its kinase activity and prevent aberrant hyperphosphorylation within its microtubule-binding domain. Removal of the C-terminal tail or mutation of this residue causes an increase in phosphorylation within the doublecortin domains, which abolishes microtubule binding. Therefore, autophosphorylation at specific sites within DCLK1 have diametric effects on the molecule's association with microtubules. Our results suggest a mechanism by which DCLK1 modulates its kinase activity to tune its microtubule-binding affinity. These results provide molecular insights for future therapeutic efforts related to DCLK1's role in cancer development and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cdc4 phospho-degrons allow differential regulation of Ame1CENP-U protein stability across the cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                Kinetochores are multi-subunit protein assemblies that link chromosomes to microtubules of the mitotic and meiotic spindle. It is still poorly understood how efficient, centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly is accomplished from hundreds of individual protein building blocks in a cell cycle dependent manner. Here, by combining comprehensive phosphorylation analysis of native Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> subunits with biochemical and functional assays in the model system budding yeast, we demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylation activates phospho-degrons on the essential subunit Ame1<sup>CENP-U </sup>which are recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-Cdc4. Gradual phosphorylation of degron motifs culminates in M-Phase and targets the protein for degradation. Binding of the Mtw1<sup>Mis12</sup> complex shields the proximal phospho-degron, protecting kinetochore-bound Ame1 from the degradation machinery. Artificially increasing degron strength partially suppresses the temperature-sensitivity of a <i>cdc4</i> mutant, while overexpression of Ame1-Okp1 is toxic in SCF mutants, demonstrating the physiological importance of this mechanism. We propose that phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits facilitates efficient centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly. Our results suggest a novel strategy for how phospho-degrons can be used to regulate the assembly of multi-subunit complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predominantly linear summation of metabotropic postsynaptic potentials follows coactivation of neurogliaform interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Summation of ionotropic receptor-mediated responses is critical in neuronal computation by shaping input-output characteristics of neurons. However, arithmetics of summation for metabotropic signals are not known. We characterized the combined ionotropic and metabotropic output of neocortical neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) using electrophysiological and anatomical methods in the rat cerebral cortex. These experiments revealed that GABA receptors are activated outside release sites and confirmed coactivation of putative NGFCs in superficial cortical layers in vivo. Triple recordings from presynaptic NGFCs converging to a postsynaptic neuron revealed sublinear summation of ionotropic GABAA responses and linear summation of metabotropic GABAB responses. Based on a model combining properties of volume transmission and distributions of all NGFC axon terminals, we predict that in 83% of cases one or two NGFCs can provide input to a point in the neuropil. We suggest that interactions of metabotropic GABAergic responses remain linear even if most superficial layer interneurons specialized to recruit GABAB receptors are simultaneously active.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Brownian ratchet model for DNA loop extrusion by the cohesin complex</a></h4>

              
                The cohesin complex topologically encircles DNA to promote sister chromatid cohesion. Alternatively, cohesin extrudes DNA loops, thought to reflect chromatin domain formation. Here, we propose a structure-based model explaining both activities. ATP and DNA binding promote cohesin conformational changes that guide DNA through a kleisin N-gate into a DNA gripping state. Two HEAT-repeat DNA binding modules, associated with cohesin’s heads and hinge, are now juxtaposed. Gripping state disassembly, following ATP hydrolysis, triggers unidirectional hinge module movement, which completes topological DNA entry by directing DNA through the ATPase head gate. If head gate passage fails, hinge module motion creates a Brownian ratchet that, instead, drives loop extrusion. Molecular-mechanical simulations of gripping state formation and resolution cycles recapitulate experimentally observed DNA loop extrusion characteristics. Our model extends to asymmetric and symmetric loop extrusion, as well as z-loop formation. Loop extrusion by biased Brownian motion has important implications for chromosomal cohesin function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Living with relatives offsets the harm caused by pathogens in natural populations</a></h4>

              
                Living with relatives can be highly beneficial, enhancing reproduction and survival. High relatedness can, however, increase susceptibility to pathogens. Here, we examine whether the benefits of living with relatives offset the harm caused by pathogens, and if this depends on whether species typically live with kin. Using comparative meta-analysis of plants, animals, and a bacterium (<i>n</i><sub>species</sub> = 56), we show that high within-group relatedness increases mortality when pathogens are present. In contrast, mortality decreased with relatedness when pathogens were rare, particularly in species that live with kin. Furthermore, across groups variation in mortality was lower when relatedness was high, but abundances of pathogens were more variable. The effects of within-group relatedness were only evident when pathogens were experimentally manipulated, suggesting that the harm caused by pathogens is masked by the benefits of living with relatives in nature. These results highlight the importance of kin selection for understanding disease spread in natural populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spike frequency adaptation supports network computations on temporally dispersed information</a></h4>

              
                For solving tasks such as recognizing a song, answering a question, or inverting a sequence of symbols, cortical microcircuits need to integrate and manipulate information that was dispersed over time during the preceding seconds. Creating biologically realistic models for the underlying computations, especially with spiking neurons and for behaviorally relevant integration time spans, is notoriously difficult. We examine the role of spike frequency adaptation in such computations and find that it has a surprisingly large impact. The inclusion of this well-known property of a substantial fraction of neurons in the neocortex – especially in higher areas of the human neocortex – moves the performance of spiking neural network models for computations on network inputs that are temporally dispersed from a fairly low level up to the performance level of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of Escherichia coli respiratory complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs reveals an uncoupled conformation</a></h4>

              
                Respiratory complex I is a multi-subunit membrane protein complex that reversibly couples NADH oxidation and ubiquinone reduction with proton translocation against trans-membrane potential. Complex I from <i>Escherichia coli </i>is among the best functionally characterized complexes, but its structure remains unknown, hindering further mechanistic studies to understand the enzyme coupling mechanism. Here we describe the single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the entire catalytically active <i>E. coli</i> complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. The structure of this mesophilic bacterial complex I displays highly dynamic connection between the peripheral and membrane domains. The peripheral domain assembly is stabilized by unique terminal extensions and an insertion loop. The membrane domain structure reveals novel dynamic features. Unusual conformation of the conserved interface between the peripheral and membrane domains suggests an uncoupled conformation of the complex. Considering constraints imposed by the structural data we suggest a new simple hypothetical coupling mechanism for the molecular machine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HOXA9 promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis by maintaining gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways</a></h4>

              
                HOXA9 is often highly expressed in leukemias. However, its precise roles in leukemogenesis remain elusive. Here, we show that HOXA9 maintains gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways to promote leukemogenesis. In MLL fusion-mediated leukemia, MLL fusion directly activates the expression of MYC and HOXA9. Combined expression of MYC and HOXA9 induced leukemia, whereas single gene transduction of either did not, indicating a synergy between MYC and HOXA9. HOXA9 sustained expression of the genes implicated in the hematopoietic precursor identity when expressed in hematopoietic precursors, but did not reactivate it once silenced. Among the HOXA9 target genes, <i>BCL2</i> and <i>SOX4</i> synergistically induced leukemia with <i>MYC</i>. Not only BCL2, but also SOX4 suppressed apoptosis, indicating that multiple anti-apoptotic pathways underlie cooperative leukemogenesis by HOXA9 and MYC. These results demonstrate that HOXA9 is a crucial transcriptional maintenance factor that promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis, potentially explaining why HOXA9 is highly expressed in many leukemias.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chondrocytes in the resting zone of the growth plate are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment</a></h4>

              
                Chondrocytes in the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate are characterized by slow cell cycle progression, and encompass a population of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing skeletal stem cells that contribute to the formation of columnar chondrocytes. However, how these chondrocytes are maintained in the resting zone remains undefined. We undertook a genetic pulse-chase approach to isolate slow cycling, label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) using a chondrocyte-specific doxycycline-controllable Tet-Off system regulating expression of histone 2B-linked GFP. Comparative RNA-seq analysis identified significant enrichment of inhibitors and activators for Wnt signaling in LRCs and non-LRCs, respectively. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocytes using <i>Pthlh-creER</i> and <i>Apc</i>-floxed allele impaired their ability to form columnar chondrocytes. Therefore, slow-cycling chondrocytes are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment within the resting zone, unraveling a novel mechanism regulating maintenance and differentiation of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells of the postnatal growth plate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age- and sex-related topological organisation of human brain functional networks and their relationship to cognition</a></h4>

              
                Age and sex have been associated with changes in functional brain network topology, which may in turn affect cognition in older adults. We explored this question further by examining differences in 11 resting-state graph theory measures with respect to age, sex, and their relationships with cognitive performance in 17,127 UK Biobank participants. Age was associated with an overall decrease in the effectiveness of network communication (i.e. integration) and loss of functional specialisation (i.e. segregation) of specific brain regions. Sex differences were also observed, with women showing more efficient networks which were less segregated than in men. Age-related changes were also more apparent in men than women, which suggests that men may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline with age. Interestingly, while network segregation and strength of limbic network were only nominally associated with cognitive performance, the network measures collectively were significantly associated with cognition. This may imply that individual measures may be inadequate to capture much of the variance in neural activity or its output and need further refinement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward-dependent selection of feedback gains impacts rapid motor decisions</a></h4>

              
                Expected reward is known to affect planning strategies through modulation of movement vigor. Strikingly, although current theories suggest that movement planning consists in selecting a goal-directed control policy, the influence of reward on feedback control strategies remains unknown. Here we investigated this question in three human reaching experiments. First, we varied the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in movement vigor for higher reward targets, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, assuming that larger feedback gains were used to reject perturbations, we sought to investigate whether this effect hindered online decisions to switch to a new target in the presence of multiple successful goals. We indeed observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and movement vigor, such that the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of movement vigor on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity. Our results highlight the competition between movement vigor and flexibility to switch target during movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Software for Non-Parametric Image Registration of 2-Photon Imaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Functional 2-photon microscopy is a key technology for imaging neuronal activity which can, however, contain non-rigid movement artifacts. Despite the established performance of variational optical flow (OF) estimation in different computer vision areas and the importance of movement correction for 2-photon applications, no OF-based method for 2-photon imaging is available. We developed the easy-to-use toolbox Flow-Registration that outperforms previous alignment tools and allows to align and reconstruct even low signal-to-noise 2-photon imaging data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global, Low Amplitude Cortical State Predicts Response Outcomes in a Selective Detection Task</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous neuronal activity strongly impacts stimulus encoding and behavioral responses. We sought to determine the effects of neocortical prestimulus activity on stimulus detection. We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca2+ imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trial-wise exposure to visual appetitive cues increases physiological arousal but not temporal discounting.</a></h4>

              
                Humans and many animals devalue future rewards as a function of time (temporal discounting). Increased discounting has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including substance-use-disorders, behavioral addictions and obesity. Despite its high intra-individual stability, temporal discounting is partly under contextual control. One prominent manipulation that has been linked to increases in discounting is the exposure to highly arousing appetitive cues. However, results from trial-wise cue exposure studies appear highly mixed, and changes in physiological arousal were not adequately controlled. Here we tested the effects of appetitive (erotic), aversive and neutral visual cues on temporal discounting in thirty-five healthy male participants. The contribution of single-trial physiological arousal was assessed using comprehensive monitoring of autonomic activity (pupil size, heart rate, electrodermal activity). Physiological arousal was elevated following aversive and in particular erotic cues. In contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, if anything, we observed decreased temporal discounting following erotic cue exposure. Aversive cues tended to increase decision noise. Computational modeling revealed that trial-wise arousal only accounted for minor variance over and above aversive and erotic condition effects, arguing against a general effect of physiological arousal on temporal discounting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotional states as distinct configurations of functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The conceptualization of emotional states as patterns of interactions between large-scale brain networks has recently gained support. Yet, few studies have directly examined the brain's network structure during emotional experiences. Here, we investigated the brain's functional network organization during experiences of sadness, amusement, and neutral states elicited by movies, in addition to a resting-state. We tested the effects of the experienced emotion on individual variability in the brain's functional connectome. Next, for each state, we defined a modular organization of the brain and quantified its segregation and integration. Our results show that emotional states increase the similarity between and within individuals in the brain's functional connectome. Second, in the brain's modular organization, sadness, relative to amusement, was associated with higher integration and increased connectivity of cognitive control networks: the salience and fronto-parietal networks. Modular metrics of brain segregation and integration were further associated with the reported emotional valence. Last, in both the functional connectome and emotional report, a higher similarity was found among women. Our results suggest that the experience of emotion is linked to a reconfiguration of whole-brain distributed, not emotion-specific, functional brain networks and that the topological structure carries information about the subjective emotional experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectivity between the hippocampus and default mode network during the relief, but not elicitation, of curiositysupports curiosity-enhanced memory enhancements</a></h4>

              
                Consistent with the idea that curiosity enhances information seeking, it has been shown that activity within both the dopaminergic circuit and hippocampus supports curiosity-enhanced learning. However, the role of whole-brain mechanisms involved in cognitive control (fronto-parietal network; FPN) and memory integration (default mode network; DMN) that might underpin curiosity states and their effects on memory remain elusive. We hypothesised that the FPN and DMN should distinguish between high- and low-curiosity conditions and be recruited more heavily for later remembered information associated with high-curiosity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst participants completed a trivia paradigm, in which we presented trivia questions associated with high- and low-curiosity, followed by the associated answer. After a short delay, we tested memory for trivia answers. We adopted a network-based parcellation of the brain into subnetworks of the FPN and DMN to examine how neural activity within, and functional connectivity between, each subnetwork predicts curiosity-enhanced memory. Across elicitation and relief of curiosity, we found focal recruitment of FPNA and widespread recruitment of DMN subnetworks in support of curiosity and curiosity-enhanced memory. Most importantly, during the elicitation of curiosity, functional subcortical connectivity and across cortical networks, but not subcortical-cortical coupling, correlated with curiosity-enhanced memory. However, during the relief of curiosity, coupling between subcortical regions and DMNA emerged in support of curiosity-enhanced memory. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence about how neuromodulatory mechanisms via the hippocampal-dopaminergic circuit trigger states of curiosity and thereby communicate to higher-order cortical regions to facilitate curiosity-enhanced memory.

                Escalation of drug use is a hallmark stage in the transition to addiction and uncovering its underlying brain molecular mechanisms constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, we report in rats with extended access to heroin for self-administration that miR-3594-5p was upregulated in the dorsal striatum at late, but not early, stages during escalation when excessive heroin intake plateaued. Striatal miR-3594-5p bound directly to the 3'UTR region of Sez6 transcript and inhibited its expression, thereby decreasing the mature form of the translated SEZ6 protein. This miR-3594-5p/Sez6 interaction was specific to heroin, as it was not observed with cocaine, and correlated with the severity of heroin intake escalation. Our findings reveal that miRNA alterations during escalation of drug self-administration are spatially and temporally regulated and drug-specific.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Internalizing symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and are more prevalent in females than in males; in contrast, externalizing symptoms typically emerge in childhood and are more commonly observed in males. Previous research has implicated aspects of white matter organization, including fractional anisotropy (FA), of cerebral tracts in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Although the cerebellum has been posited to integrate limbic and cortical regions, its role in psychopathology is not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we investigated whether FA of the superior (SCP), middle (MCP), and inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP) predict change in symptoms and whether sex moderates this association. One hundred eleven adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report, assessing symptoms at baseline (ages 9–13 years) and again 2 years later. Participants also underwent diffusion-weighted imaging at baseline. We used deterministic tractography to segment and compute mean FA of the cerebellar peduncles. Lower FA of the right SCP at baseline predicted increases in internalizing symptoms in females only. Lower FA in the right SCP and ICP also predicted increases in externalizing symptoms in females, but these associations did not survive multiple comparison correction. There was no association between FA of the cerebellar peduncles and change in symptoms in males or between MCP FA and symptom changes in males or females. Organizational properties of the SCP may be a sex-specific marker of internalizing symptom changes in adolescence. The cerebellar peduncles should be explored further in future studies to elucidate sex differences in symptoms.</p>

                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We explored the organization of motor units recorded in the flexor digitorum superficialis into stable groups (MU-modes) and force-stabilizing synergies in spaces of MU-modes. Young, healthy participants performed one-finger and three-finger accurate cyclical force production tasks. Two wireless sensor arrays (Trigno Galileo, Delsys, Inc.) were placed over the proximal and distal portions of the muscle for surface recording and identification of motor unit action potentials. Principal component analysis with Varimax rotation and factor extraction was used to identify MU-modes. The framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis was used to analyze inter-cycle variance in the space of MU-modes and compute the index of force-stabilizing synergy. Multiple linear regression between the first MU-mode in the three-finger task and the first MU-modes in the three single-finger tasks showed no differences between the data recorded by the two electrodes suggesting that MU-modes were unlikely to be synonymous with muscle compartments. Multi-MU-mode synergies stabilizing task force were documented across all tasks. In contrast, there were no force-stabilizing synergies in the three-finger task analyzed in the space of individual finger forces. Our results confirm the synergic organization of motor units in single-finger tasks and, for the first time, expand this result to multi-finger tasks. We offer an interpretation of the findings within the theoretical scheme of control with spatial referent coordinates expanded to the analysis of individual motor units. The results confirm trade-offs between synergies at different hierarchical levels and expand this notion to intra-muscle synergies.</p>

	<p>Background: The directional preference of otolith-related vestibular neurons elucidates the neuroanatomical link of labyrinths, but few direct experimental data have been provided. Methods: The directional preference of otolith-related vestibular neurons was measured in the vestibular nucleus using chemically induced unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL). For the model evaluation, static and dynamic behavioral tests as well as a histological test were performed. Extracellular neural activity was recorded for the neuronal responses to the horizontal head rotation and the linear head translation. Results: Seventy-seven neuronal activities were recorded, and the total population was divided into three groups: left UL (20), sham (35), and right UL (22). Based on directional preference, two sub-groups were again classified as contra- and ipsi-preferred neurons. There was no significance in the number of those sub-groups (contra-, 15/35, 43%; ipsi-, 20/35, 57%) in the sham (p = 0.155). However, more ipsi-preferred neurons (19/22, 86%) were observed after right UL (p = 6.056 × 10−5), while left UL caused more contra-preferred neurons (13/20, 65%) (p = 0.058). In particular, the convergent neurons mainly led this biased difference (ipsi-, 100% after right UL and contra-, 89% after left UL) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002). Conclusions: The directional preference of the neurons depended on the side of the lesion, and its dominance was mainly led by the convergent neurons.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been harmed by the coronavirus, and older adults have remained isolated for a long time with many restrictions. The aim of this study was to measure the decline in cognitive, functional, and affective status in a care facility after the lockdown in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with previous measures in order to determine if this decline was accelerated. (2) Methods: Ninety-eight participants were recruited. Data from three retrospective pre-lockdown assessments and an additional post-lockdown assessment were analyzed. Mixed ANOVA analyses were performed according to the Clinical Dementia Rating levels, considering social-contact frequency during the lockdown as a covariate. (3) Results: The cognitive and functional scores were lower and depression scores were higher after the strict lockdown, accelerating a general pattern of decline that was already present in LTCF residents. The frequency of social contact eliminated the measurement differences in the cognitive and functional scores and the group differences in depression scores. (4) Conclusions: The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in an LTCF were mediated by the frequency of contact. Clinical implications: Preventive measures must be taken to ensure social contact with relatives and friends and reduce the negative consequences of social isolation in LTCFs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Necroptosis increases with age in the brain and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), termed neuroinflammation, is a hallmark of aging and a proposed mediator of cognitive decline associated with aging. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the persistent activation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) being one of the well-known activators of microglia. Because necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induce inflammation through the release of DAMPs, we hypothesized that an age-associated increase in necroptosis contributes to increased neuroinflammation with age. The marker of necroptosis, phosphorylated form of MLKL (P-MLKL), and kinases in the necroptosis pathway (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL) showed a region-specific increase in the brain with age, specifically in the cortex layer V and the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice. Similarly, MLKL-oligomers, which causes membrane binding and permeabilization were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice relative to young mice. Nearly 70 to 80% of P-MLKL immunoreactivity was localized to neurons and less than 10% was localized to microglia, whereas no P-MLKL was detected in astrocytes. P-MLKL expression in neurons was detected in the soma, not in the processes. Blocking necroptosis using Mlkl-/- mice reduced markers (Iba-1 and GFAP) of neuroinflammation in the brains of old mice and short-term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1s, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, in the hippocampus of old mice. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that brain necroptosis increases with age and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Sensory Neurons in Painful Diabetic Neuropathy Reveals Inflammation and Neuronal Loss</a></h4>

              
                Pathological sensations caused by peripheral painful neuropathy occurring in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often described as sharp and burning and are commonly spontaneous in origin. Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic glove and stocking pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls. Transcriptome analyses identified 844 differentially expressed genes. We observed increases in levels of inflammation-associated genes from macrophages in DPN patients that may contribute to increased pain hypersensitivity and, conversely, there were frequent decreases in neuronally-related genes. The elevated inflammatory gene profile and the accompanying downregulation of multiple neuronal genes provide new insights into intraganglionic pathology and mechanisms causing neuropathic pain in DPN patients with T2DM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-Glia Signaling Regulates the Onset of the Antidepressant Response</a></h4>

              
                Commonly prescribed antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) take weeks to achieve therapeutic benefits1, 2. The underlying mechanisms of why antidepressants take weeks or months to reverse depressed mood are not understood. Using a single cell sequencing approach, we analyzed gene expression changes in mice subjected to stress-induced depression and determined their temporal response to antidepressant treatment in the cerebral cortex. We discovered that both glial and neuronal cell populations elicit gene expression changes in response to stress, and that these changes are reversed upon treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac), a widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Upon reproducing the molecular signaling events regulated by fluoxetine3 in a cortical culture system, we found that these transcriptional changes are serotonin-dependent, require reciprocal neuron-glia communication, and involve temporally-specified sequences of autoregulation and cross-regulation between FGF2 and BDNF signaling pathways. Briefly, stimulation of Fgf2 synthesis and signaling directly regulates Bdnf synthesis and secretion cell-non-autonomously requiring neuron-glia interactions, which then activates neuronal BDNF-TrkB signaling to drive longer-term neuronal adaptations4-6 leading to improved mood. Our studies highlight temporal and cell type specific mechanisms promoting the onset of the antidepressant response, that we propose could offer novel avenues for mitigating delayed onset of antidepressant therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A distributed dopamine-gated circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent behavior in Drosophila females</a></h4>

              
                Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in most female animals. Here, we show that a mating-induced increase in olfactory attraction of female Drosophila flies to nutrients relies on interconnected neural pathways in the two higher olfactory brain regions, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB). Using whole brain calcium imaging, we find that mating does not induce a global change in the activity of the whole brain nor of entire brain regions, suggesting specific neuronal or network changes in the olfactory system. Systematic behavioral screening and electron microscopy (EM) connectomics identify two types of LH output neurons required for the attraction of females to polyamines -one of them previously implicated in the processing of male pheromones. In addition, we characterize multiple MB pathways capable of inducing or suppressing polyamine attraction, with synaptic connections to the identified LH neurons and a prominent role for the {beta}'1 compartment. Moreover, {beta}'1 dopaminergic neurons are modulated by mating and are sufficient to replace mating experience in virgins inducing the lasting behavioral switch in female preference. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that reproductive state-dependent expression of female choice behavior is regulated by a dopamine-gated distributed learning circuit comprising both higher olfactory brain centers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PiRATeMC: A highly flexible, scalable, and affordable system for obtaining high quality video recordings for behavioral neuroscience.</a></h4>

              
                With the recent development and rapidly accelerating adoption of machine-learning based rodent behavioral tracking tools such as DeepLabCut, one common variable that can impact the quality and consistency of results is the camera system. Many experimenters use webcams, GoPros, or other commercially available cameras that are not only relatively expensive, but offer very little flexibility over recording parameters. These cameras are not optimized for recording many types of behavioral experiments, which can lead to suboptimal video quality. Furthermore, it is a challenge, if not impossible, to synchronize multiple cameras with each other, or to send/receive a trigger with external signals such as a TTL pulse or a network connection. We have developed an affordable ecosystem of behavioral recording equipment, PiRATeMC (Pi-based Remote Acquisition Technology for Motion Capture), that relies on Raspberry Pi Camera Boards that are ideal for recording in both bright light, low light, and dark conditions under infrared light. PiRATeMC offers users control over nearly every recording parameter. This setup can easily be scaled up and synchronously controlled in clusters via a self-contained network to record a large number of simultaneous behavioral sessions without burdening institutional network infrastructure. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for novice and inexperienced programmers interested in using an open-source recording system, with a large online community that is very active in developing novel open-source tools. Moreover, it easily interfaces with Arduinos and other microcontrollers, allowing simple synchronization and interfacing of video recording with nearly any behavioral equipment using GPIO pins to send or receive 3.3V or 5V signals, I2C, or serial communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral habenula M2 muscarinic receptor control of neuronal activity and cocaine seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb) plays a central role in balancing reward and aversion by opposing the contributions of brain reward nuclei. Using a rat cocaine self-administration model, we previously found that LHb inhibition or non-selective blockade of LHb muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) led to persistent cocaine seeking despite its signaled unavailability. As understanding roles for the LHb and cholinergic signaling in behavioral control is important to psychiatric illness and addiction, we examine how mAChRs act on LHb neurons using in vitro electrophysiology. We find that different groups of LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh), and that CCh could inhibit GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs to these cells. Presynaptic CCh effects were reversed by the M2 mAChR (M2R) antagonist AFDX-116, but not by pirenzepine, an M1R antagonist. Contemporaneous measurement of CCh effects on synaptic inhibition and excitation in LHb neurons showed a smaller effect on inhibition, suggesting a net shift in synaptic integration toward greater inhibition by mAChRs. Synaptic currents elicited by light-activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) axons in the LHb, following channelrhodopsin-2 transfection of VTA, were also inhibited by M2Rs, suggesting the VTA as at least one M2R-sensitive LHb afferent. Finally, Go-NoGo cocaine seeking studies showed that blockade of LHb M2Rs, and not M1Rs, triggered continued cocaine seeking. These data identify LHb M2Rs as a potential control point of LHb function that enables withholding responses for cocaine and define cellular mechanisms through which mAChRs modulate LHb activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The olfactory organ is a unique site for resident neutrophils in the brain</a></h4>

              
                For decades we have known that the brain "drains" through the subarachnoid space following a route that crosses the cribriform plate to the nasal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes. Yet little is known about the potential role of the olfactory epithelia and associated lymphatic vasculature in the immune response. To better understand the immune response in the olfactory organs we used cell-specific fluorescent reporter lines in dissected, intact adult brains to visualize blood-lymphatic vasculature and neutrophils in the olfactory sensory system. Here we show that the extensive blood vasculature of the olfactory organs is associated with a lymphatic cell type resembling high endothelial venules (HEVs) of the lymph nodes in mammals and a second resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs) that extended from the brain to the peripheral olfactory epithelia. Surprisingly, the olfactory organs contained the only neutrophil populations observed in the brain. Damage to the olfactory epithelia resulted in a rapid increase of neutrophils within the olfactory organs as well as the appearance of neutrophils in the brain suggesting that neutrophils enter the brain in response to damage. Analysis of cell division during and after damage showed an increase in BrdU labeling in the olfactory epithelia and a subset of the neutrophils. Our results reveal a unique population of neutrophils in the olfactory organs that are associated with an extensive lymphatic vasculature suggesting a dual olfactory-immune function for this unique sensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strong and opponent contributions of dorsomedial striatal pathways to behavior depends on cognitive demands and task strategy</a></h4>

              
                A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, has remained unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on a task's cognitive demands. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that - even within a single task - the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the cognitive demands imposed by a task, as well as the strategy that mice pursue within a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glutamatergic dysfunction leads to a hyper-dopaminergic phenotype through deficits in short-term habituation: a mechanism for aberrant salience.</a></h4>

              
                Psychosis in disorders like schizophrenia is commonly associated with aberrant salience and elevated striatal dopamine. However, the underlying cause(s) of this hyper-dopaminergic state remain elusive. Various lines of evidence point to glutamatergic dysfunction and impairments in synaptic plasticity in the aetiology of schizophrenia, including deficits associated with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit. GluA1 knockout (Gria1-/-) mice provide a model of impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia and exhibit a selective deficit in a form of short-term memory which underlies short-term habituation. As such, these mice are unable to reduce attention to recently presented stimuli. In this study we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens of Gria1-/- mice to determine whether this behavioral phenotype might be a key driver of a hyper-dopaminergic state. There was no effect of GluA1 deletion on electrically-evoked dopamine responses in anaesthetized mice, demonstrating normal endogenous release properties of dopamine neurons in Gria1-/- mice. Furthermore, dopamine signals were initially similar in Gria1-/- mice compared to controls in response to both sucrose rewards and neutral light stimuli. They were also equally sensitive to changes in the magnitude of delivered rewards. In contrast, however, these stimulus-evoked dopamine signals failed to habituate with repeated presentations in Gria1-/- mice, resulting in a task-relevant, hyper-dopaminergic phenotype. Thus, here we show that GluA1 dysfunction, resulting in impaired short-term habituation, is a key driver of enhanced striatal dopamine responses, which may be an important contributor to aberrant salience and psychosis in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.

	<p>Objective: There is growing evidence that in adults, higher levels of handgrip strength (HGS) are linked to better cognitive performance. However, the relationship between HGS and cognitive performance has not been sufficiently investigated in special cohorts, such as individuals with hypertension who have an intrinsically higher risk of cognitive decline. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between HGS and cognitive performance in adults with hypertension using data from the Global Ageing and Adult Health Survey (SAGE). Methods: A total of 4486 Chinese adults with hypertension from the SAGE were included in this study. Absolute handgrip strength (aHGS in kilograms) was measured using a handheld electronic dynamometer, and cognitive performance was assessed in the domains of short-term memory, delayed memory, and language ability. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between relative handgrip strength (rHGS; aHGS divided by body mass index) and measures of cognitive performance. Results: Overall, higher levels of rHGS were associated with higher scores in short-term memory (β = 0.20) and language (β = 0.63) compared with the lowest tertiles of rHGS. In male participants, higher HGS was associated with higher scores in short-term memory (β = 0.31), language (β = 0.64), and delayed memory (β = 0.22). There were no associations between rHGS and cognitive performance measures in females. Conclusion: We observed that a higher level of rHGS was associated with better cognitive performance among hypertensive male individuals. Further studies are needed to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms, including sex-specific differences driving the relationship between measures of HGS and cognitive performance in individuals with hypertension.</p>

	<p>The known theories discussing the essence of consciousness have been recently updated. This prompts an attempt to integrate these explanations concerning several distinct components of the consciousness phenomenon such as the ego, and qualia perceptions. Therefore, it is useful to consider the latest publications on the ‘Orch OR’ and ‘cemi’ theories, which assume that quantum processing occurs in microtubules and that the brain’s endogenous electromagnetic field is important. The authors combine these explanations with their own theory describing the neural circuits realizing imagery. They try to present such an interdisciplinary, integrated theoretical model in a manner intuitively understandable to people with a typical medical education. In order to do this, they even refer to intuitively understandable metaphors. The authors maintain that an effective comprehension of consciousness is important for health care professionals because its disorders are frequent medical symptoms in emergencies, during general anesthesia and in the course of cognitive disorders in elderly people. The authors emphasize the current possibilities to verify these theses regarding the essence of consciousness thanks to the development of functional brain imaging methods—magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation—as well as clinical studies on the modification of perceptions and feelings by such techniques as mindfulness and the use of certain psychoactive substances, especially among people with self-awareness and identity disorders.</p>

	<p>The search for and development of new neuroprotective (or cerebroprotective) drugs, as well as suitable methods for their preclinical efficacy evaluation, are priorities for current biomedical research. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as mafedine and dexmedetomidine, are a highly appealing group of drugs capable of reducing neurological deficits which result from brain trauma and vascular events in both experimental animals and human patients. Thus, our aim was to assess the effects of mafedine and dexmedetomidine on the brain’s electrical activity in a controlled cortical-impact model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. The functional status of the animals was assessed by electrocorticography (ECoG), using ECoG electrodes which were chronically implanted in different cortical regions. The administration of intraperitoneal mafedine sodium at 2.5 mg∙kg−1 at 1 h after TBI induction, and daily for the following 6 days, restored interhemispheric connectivity in remote brain regions and intrahemispheric connections within the unaffected hemisphere at post-TBI day 7. Animals that had received mafedine sodium also demonstrated an improvement in cortical responses to photic and somatosensory stimulation. Dexmedetomidine at 25 μg∙kg−1 did not affect the brain’s electrical activity in brain-injured rats. Our results confirm the previously described neuroprotective effects of mafedine sodium and suggest that ECoG registration and analysis are a viable method evaluating drug efficacy in experimental animal models of TBI.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">With disease-modifying approaches under evaluation in ataxia-telangiectasia and other ataxias, there is a need for objective and reliable biomarkers of free-living motor function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that metrics derived from a single wrist sensor worn at home provide accurate, reliable, and interpretable information about neurological disease severity in children with A-T.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">A total of 15 children with A-T and 15 age- and sex-matched controls wore a sensor with a triaxial accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 1 week at home. Activity intensity measures, derived from the sensor data, were compared with in-person neurological evaluation on the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) and performance on a validated computer mouse task.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Children with A-T were inactive the same proportion of each day as controls but produced more low intensity movements (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 1.48) and fewer high intensity movements (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 1.71). The range of activity intensities was markedly reduced in A-T compared to controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s <em class="a-plus-plus">d</em> = 2.72). The activity metrics correlated strongly with arm, gait, and total clinical severity (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.71–0.87; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001), correlated with specific computer task motor features (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.67–0.92; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01), demonstrated high reliability (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em>: 0.86–0.93; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.00001), and were not significantly influenced by age in the healthy control group.</p>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Motor activity metrics from a single, inexpensive wrist sensor during free-living behavior provide accurate and reliable information about diagnosis, neurological disease severity, and motor performance. These low-burden measurements are applicable independent of ambulatory status and are potential digital behavioral biomarkers in A-T.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Infants acquire the ability to roll over from the supine to the prone position, which requires body coordination of multiple degrees of freedom under dynamic interactions with the ground. Although previous studies on infant rolling observed kinematic characteristics, little is known about the kinetic characteristics of body segments in contact with the surface. We measured the ground contact pressure under the arms, legs, head, and proximal body segments using a pressure mat and their displacements using a three-dimensional motion capture system. The data obtained from 17 infants aged 9–10 months indicated that most of them showed 2–4 of 6 highly observed movement patterns, including 1 axial rolling, 2 spinal flexion, and 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The arms and legs had small contributions to the ground contact pressure in the axial rolling and spinal flexion patterns. The ipsilateral leg in relation to the rolling direction was involved in supporting the body weight in only 1 shoulder girdle leading pattern. The contralateral leg showed large peak pressure to push on the floor before rolling in 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The results indicate that infants can produce multiple rolling-over patterns with different strategies to coordinate their body segments and interact with the floor. The results of the analysis of the movement patterns further suggest that few patterns correspond to those reported in adults. This implies that infants generate unique motor patterns by taking into account their own biomechanical constraints.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Subpopulations of primary nociceptors (C- and Aδ-fibers), express the TRPV1 receptor for heat and capsaicin. During cutaneous inflammation, these afferents may become sensitized, leading to primary hyperalgesia. It is known that TRPV1<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> nociceptors are involved in heat hyperalgesia; however, their involvement in mechanical hyperalgesia is unclear. This study explored the contribution of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors in the development of mechanical and heat hyperalgesia in humans following ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation. Skin areas in 18 healthy volunteers were randomized to treatment with 8% capsaicin/vehicle patches for 24 h. After patches removal, one capsaicin-treated area and one vehicle area were irradiated with 2xMED (minimal erythema dose) of UVB. 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB exposure, tests were performed to evaluate the development of UVB-induced cutaneous hyperalgesia: thermal detection and pain thresholds, pain sensitivity to supra-threshold heat stimuli, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity, touch pleasantness, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), inflammatory response, pigmentation and micro-vascular reactivity. Capsaicin pre-treatment, in the UVB-irradiated area (Capsaicin + UVB area), increased heat pain thresholds (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05), and decreased supra-threshold heat pain sensitivity (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05) 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB irradiation, while mechanical hyperalgesia resulted unchanged (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.2). No effects of capsaicin were reported on touch pleasantness (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 1), TEWL (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.31), inflammatory response and pigmentation (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.3) or micro-vascular reactivity (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &gt; 0.8) in response to the UVB irradiation. 8% capsaicin ablation predominantly defunctionalizes TRPV1<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-expressing cutaneous nociceptors responsible for heat pain transduction, suggesting that sensitization of these fibers is required for development of heat hyperalgesia following cutaneous UVB-induced inflammation but they are likely only partially necessary for the establishment of robust primary mechanical hyperalgesia.</p>

	<p>According to the Unaccusative Hypothesis, intransitive verbs are divided into unaccusative and unergative ones based on the distinction of their syntactic properties, which has been proved by previous theoretical and empirical evidence. However, debate has been raised regarding whether intransitive verbs in Mandarin Chinese can be split into unaccusative and unergative ones syntactically. To analyze this theoretical controversy, the present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the neural processing of deep unaccusative, unergative sentences, and passive sentences (derived structures undergoing a syntactic movement) in Mandarin Chinese. The results revealed no significant difference in the neural processing of deep unaccusative and unergative sentences, and the comparisons between passive sentences and the other sentence types revealed activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) and the left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG). These findings indicate that the syntactic processing of unaccusative and unergative verbs in Mandarin Chinese is highly similar but different from that of passive verbs, which suggests that deep unaccusative and unergative sentences in Mandarin Chinese are both base-generated structures and that there is no syntactic distinction between unaccusative and unergative verbs in Mandarin Chinese.</p>

	<p>Musical training has been shown to have a positive influence on a variety of skills, including auditory-based tasks and nonmusical cognitive and executive functioning tasks; however, because previous investigations have yielded mixed results regarding the relationship between musical training and these skills, the purpose of this study was to examine and compare the auditory processing skills of children who receive focused, daily musical training with those with more limited, generalized musical training. Sixteen typically developing children (second–fourth grade) from two different schools receiving different music curricula were assessed on measures of pitch discrimination, temporal sequencing, and prosodic awareness. The results indicated significantly better scores in pitch discrimination abilities for the children receiving daily, focused musical training (School 1) compared to students attending music class only once per week, utilizing a more generalized elementary school music curriculum (School 2). The findings suggest that more in-depth and frequent musical training may be associated with better pitch discrimination abilities in children. This finding is important given that the ability to discriminate pitch has been linked to improved phonological processing skills, an important skill for developing spoken language and literacy. Future investigations are needed to determine whether the null findings for temporal sequencing and prosodic awareness can be replicated or may be different for various grades and tasks for measuring these abilities.</p>

	<p>Objective: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) represents a diagnostic challenge considering the great variability of clinical presentation and multiorgan involvement. In the present study, we report the prevalence of kidney involvement and kidney function over time in a cohort of ATTRv patients with different transthyretin gene mutations. Patients and Methods: For this study, we systematically collected data from all patients with a diagnosis of ATTRv followed at the Neurology Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS. Kidney involvement was defined as presence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &amp;amp;lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 obtained with CKD-EPI equation, abnormal urinary protein excretion (UPE) (&amp;amp;gt;150 mg/24 h) and/or albuminuria &amp;amp;gt;30 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinine). The analysis included data from 46 patients with 122 measurements of serum creatinine. Results: Among the 46 patients included in the analysis, kidney involvement was present in 37%, with 15% showing reduced eGFR and 22% abnormal UPE (63% of patients with available UPE data). No single predictor was associated with either eGFR values or its slope over time. Conclusions: Kidney involvement is quite common in patients with ATTRv regardless of the underlying genetic variant. In particular, abnormal UPE appears to be a common feature of the disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The developmental biology of Charnia and the eumetazoan affinity of the Ediacaran rangeomorphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular timescales estimate that early animal lineages diverged tens of millions of years before their earliest unequivocal fossil evidence. The Ediacaran macrobiota (~574 to 538 million years ago) are largely eschewed from this debate, primarily due to their extreme phylogenetic uncertainty, but remain germane. We characterize the development of <I>Charnia masoni</I> and establish the affinity of rangeomorphs, among the oldest and most enigmatic components of the Ediacaran macrobiota. We provide the first direct evidence for the internal interconnected nature of rangeomorphs and show that <I>Charnia</I> was constructed of repeated branches that derived successively from pre-existing branches. We find homology and rationalize morphogenesis between disparate rangeomorph taxa, before producing a phylogenetic analysis, resolving <I>Charnia</I> as a stem-eumetazoan and expanding the anatomical disparity of that group to include a long-extinct bodyplan. These data bring competing records of early animal evolution into closer agreement, reformulating our understanding of the evolutionary emergence of animal bodyplans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Genomic signatures of the unjamming transition in compressed human bronchial epithelial cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epithelial tissue can transition from a jammed, solid-like, quiescent phase to an unjammed, fluid-like, migratory phase, but the underlying molecular events of the unjamming transition (UJT) remain largely unexplored. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and one well-defined trigger of the UJT, compression mimicking the mechanical effects of bronchoconstriction, here, we combine RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks to provide the first genome-wide analysis of the UJT. Our results show that compression induces an early transcriptional activation of the membrane and actomyosin network and a delayed activation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-matrix networks. This response is associated with a signaling cascade that promotes actin polymerization and cellular motility through the coordinated interplay of downstream pathways including ERK, JNK, integrin signaling, and energy metabolism. Moreover, in nonasthmatic versus asthmatic HBECs, common genomic patterns associated with ECM remodeling suggest a molecular connection between airway remodeling, bronchoconstriction, and the UJT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Intrasaccadic motion streaks jump-start gaze correction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rapid eye movements (saccades) incessantly shift objects across the retina. To establish object correspondence, the visual system is thought to match surface features of objects across saccades. Here, we show that an object&rsquo;s intrasaccadic retinal trace&mdash;a signal previously considered unavailable to visual processing&mdash;facilitates this match making. Human observers made saccades to a cued target in a circular stimulus array. Using high-speed visual projection, we swiftly rotated this array during the eyes&rsquo; flight, displaying continuous intrasaccadic target motion. Observers&rsquo; saccades landed between the target and a distractor, prompting secondary saccades. Independently of the availability of object features, which we controlled tightly, target motion increased the rate and reduced the latency of gaze-correcting saccades to the initial presaccadic target, in particular when the target&rsquo;s stimulus features incidentally gave rise to efficient motion streaks. These results suggest that intrasaccadic visual information informs the establishment of object correspondence and jump-starts gaze correction.</p>

                <p>Mosquito midgut epithelium traversal is essential for malaria parasite transmission. Phospholipid flippases are eukaryotic type 4 P-type adenosine triphosphatases (P4-ATPases), which, in association with CDC50, translocate phospholipids across the membrane lipid bilayers. In this study, we investigated the function of a putative P4-ATPase, ATP7, from the rodent malaria parasite <I>Plasmodium yoelii</I>. Disruption of ATP7 blocks the parasite infection of mosquitoes. ATP7 is localized on the ookinete plasma membrane. While ATP7-depleted ookinetes are capable of invading the midgut, they are eliminated within the epithelial cells by a process independent from the mosquito complement-like immunity. ATP7 colocalizes and interacts with the flippase cofactor CDC50C. Depletion of CDC50C phenocopies ATP7 deficiency. ATP7-depleted ookinetes fail to uptake phosphatidylcholine across the plasma membrane. Ookinete microinjection into the mosquito hemocoel reverses the ATP7 deficiency phenotype. Our study identifies <I>Plasmodium</I> flippase as a mechanism of parasite survival in the midgut epithelium that is required for mosquito transmission.</p>

                <p>A strategy integrating near infrared (NIR) photothermal and catalytic effects within one active center beyond ultraviolet and visible light is proposed without the combination of separated photothermal transformation components. A giant polyoxomolybdate, which has high NIR photothermal conversion efficiency, is selected as the model catalyst, while a cationic &beta;-cyclodextrin is used to cover its negatively charged surface electrostatically. Under NIR light radiation, the designed catalyst increases catalytic activity of cyclohexene oxidation under O<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere in water. The conversion reaches about pentaploid of the reaction without NIR radiation. By excluding heating effect from the external heater at the same temperature, about twice as much enhancement, which can be attributed to the sole photothermal action, is still observed. While the catalytic center is shielded by the organic porous layer, the surface cavity allows the integrated catalyst to conduct a selective catalysis by screening the molecules in size over the surface channel.</p>

                <p>Bile salt synthesis, secretion into the intestinal lumen, and resorption in the ileum occur in all vertebrate classes. In mammals, bile salt composition is determined by host and microbial enzymes, affecting signaling through the bile salt&ndash;binding transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (Fxr). However, these processes in other vertebrate classes remain poorly understood. We show that key components of hepatic bile salt synthesis and ileal transport pathways are conserved and under control of Fxr in zebrafish. Zebrafish bile salts consist primarily of a C<SUB>27</SUB> bile alcohol and a C<SUB>24</SUB> bile acid that undergo multiple microbial modifications including bile acid deconjugation that augments Fxr activity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide a cellular atlas of the zebrafish intestinal epithelium and uncover roles for Fxr in transcriptional and differentiation programs in ileal and other cell types. These results establish zebrafish as a nonmammalian vertebrate model for studying bile salt metabolism and Fxr signaling.</p>

                <p>Artificial muscles based on stimuli-responsive polymers usually exhibit mechanical compliance, versatility, and high power-to-weight ratio, showing great promise to potentially replace conventional rigid motors for next-generation soft robots, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. In particular, thermomechanical liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) constitute artificial muscle-like actuators that can be remotely triggered for large stroke, fast response, and highly repeatable actuations. Here, we introduce a digital light processing (DLP)&ndash;based additive manufacturing approach that automatically shear aligns mesogenic oligomers, layer-by-layer, to achieve high orientational order in the photocrosslinked structures; this ordering yields high specific work capacity (63 J kg<sup>&ndash;1</sup>) and energy density (0.18 MJ m<sup>&ndash;3</sup>). We demonstrate actuators composed of these DLP printed LCEs&rsquo; applications in soft robotics, such as reversible grasping, untethered crawling, and weightlifting. Furthermore, we present an LCE self-sensing system that exploits thermally induced optical transition as an intrinsic option toward feedback control.</p>

                <p>Coupling between cell-autonomous circadian oscillators is crucial to prevent desynchronization of cellular networks and disruption of circadian tissue functions. While neuronal oscillators within the mammalian central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, couple intercellularly, coupling among peripheral oscillators is controversial and the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Using two- and three-dimensional mammalian culture models in vitro (mainly human U-2 OS cells) and ex vivo, we show that peripheral oscillators couple via paracrine pathways. We identify transforming growth factor&ndash;&beta; (TGF-&beta;) as peripheral coupling factor that mediates paracrine phase adjustment of molecular clocks through transcriptional regulation of core-clock genes. Disruption of TGF-&beta; signaling causes desynchronization of oscillator networks resulting in reduced amplitude and increased sensitivity toward external zeitgebers. Our findings reveal an unknown mechanism for peripheral clock synchrony with implications for rhythmic organ functions and circadian health.</p>

                <p>Nanoscale magnetic structures are fundamental to the design and fabrication of spintronic devices and have exhibited tremendous potential superior to the conventional semiconductor devices. However, most of the magnetic moments in nanostructures are unstable due to size effect, and the possible solution based on exchange coupling between nanomagnetism is still not clear. Here, graphene-mediated exchange coupling between nanomagnets is demonstrated by depositing discrete superparamagnetic Ni nano-islands on single-crystal graphene. The heterostructure exhibits ideal two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism with clear hysteresis loops and Curie temperature up to 80 K. The intrinsic ferromagnetism in graphene and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between graphene and Ni nano-islands are revealed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and density functional theory calculations. The artificial 2D ferromagnets constitute a platform to study the coupling mechanism between complex correlated electronic systems and magnetism on the nanoscale, and the results and concept provide insights into the realization of spin manipulation in quantum computing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Layer-engineered interlayer excitons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Photoluminescence (PL) from excitons serves as a powerful tool to characterize the optoelectronic property and band structure of semiconductors, especially for atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials. However, PL quenches quickly when the thickness of TMD materials increases from monolayer to a few layers, due to the change from direct to indirect band transition. Here, we show that PL can be recovered by engineering multilayer heterostructures, with the band transition reserved to be a direct type. We report emission from layer-engineered interlayer excitons from these multilayer heterostructures. Moreover, as desired for valleytronics devices, the lifetime, valley polarization, and valley lifetime of the generated interlayer excitons can all be substantially improved as compared with that in the monolayer-monolayer heterostructure. Our results pave the way for controlling the properties of interlayer excitons by layer engineering.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Dichotomous dopaminergic and noradrenergic neural states mediate distinct aspects of exploitative behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                <p>The balance between exploiting known actions and exploring alternatives is critical for survival and hypothesized to rely on shifts in neuromodulation. We developed a behavioral paradigm to capture exploitative and exploratory states and imaged calcium dynamics in genetically identified dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons. During exploitative states, characterized by motivated repetition of the same action choice, dopamine neurons in SNc encoding movement vigor showed sustained elevation of basal activity that lasted many seconds. This sustained activity emerged from longer positive responses, which accumulated during exploitative action-reward bouts, and hysteretic dynamics. Conversely, noradrenergic neurons in LC showed sustained inhibition of basal activity due to the accumulation of longer negative responses in LC. Chemogenetic manipulation of these sustained dynamics revealed that dopaminergic activity mediates action drive, whereas noradrenergic activity modulates choice diversity. These data uncover the emergence of sustained neural states in dopaminergic and noradrenergic networks that mediate dissociable aspects of exploitative bouts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">New mechanism and exact theory of superconductivity from strong repulsive interaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>We introduce a general mechanism for superconductivity in Fermi systems with strong repulsive interaction. Because kinetic terms are small compared to the bare repulsion, the dynamics of charge carriers is constrained by the presence of other nearby carriers. By treating kinetic terms as a perturbation around the atomic limit, we show that pairing can be induced by correlated multiparticle tunneling processes that favor two itinerant carriers to be close together. Our analytically controlled theory provides a quantitative formula relating <I>T<SUB>c</SUB></I> to microscopic parameters, with maximum <I>T<SUB>c</SUB></I> reaching about 10% of the Fermi temperature. Our work demonstrates a powerful method for studying strong coupling superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry. It also offers a realistic new route to realizing finite angular momentum superfluidity of spin-polarized fermions in optical lattice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A molecular sensor for cholesterol in the human serotonin1A receptor</a></h4>

              
                <p>The function of several G protein&ndash;coupled receptors (GPCRs) exhibits cholesterol sensitivity. Cholesterol sensitivity of GPCRs could be attributed to specific sequence and structural features, such as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif, that facilitate their cholesterol-receptor interaction. In this work, we explored the molecular basis of cholesterol sensitivity exhibited by the serotonin<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor, the most studied GPCR in the context of cholesterol sensitivity, by generating mutants of key residues in CRAC motifs in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) and TM5 of the receptor. Our results show that a lysine residue (K101) in one of the CRAC motifs is crucial for sensing altered membrane cholesterol levels. Insights from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that cholesterol-sensitive functional states of the serotonin<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor are associated with reduced conformational dynamics of extracellular loops of the receptor. These results constitute one of the first reports on the molecular mechanism underlying cholesterol sensitivity of GPCRs.</p>

                <p>Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTd) represents a major health care problem with a high, unmet medical need. Design of additional therapies for LUTd requires precise tools to study bladder storage and voiding (dys)function in animal models. We developed videocystometry in mice, combining intravesical pressure measurements with high-speed fluoroscopy of the urinary tract. Videocystometry substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art methods to monitor the urine storage and voiding process, by enabling quantitative analysis of voiding efficiency, urethral flow, vesicoureteral reflux, and the relation between intravesical pressure and flow, in both anesthetized and awake, nonrestrained mice. Using videocystometry, we identified localized bladder wall micromotions correlated with different states of the filling/voiding cycle, revealed an acute effect of TRPV1 channel activation on voiding efficiency, and pinpointed the effects of urethane anesthesia on urine storage and urethral flow. Videocystometry has broad applications, ranging from the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of bladder control to drug development for LUTd.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A variable-gain stochastic pooling motif mediates information transfer from receptor assemblies into NF-{kappa}B</a></h4>

              
                <p>A myriad of inflammatory cytokines regulate signaling pathways to maintain cellular homeostasis. The IB kinase (IKK) complex is an integration hub for cytokines that govern nuclear factor B (NF-B) signaling. In response to inflammation, IKK is activated through recruitment to receptor-associated protein assemblies. How and what information IKK complexes transmit about the milieu are open questions. Here, we track dynamics of IKK complexes and nuclear NF-B to identify upstream signaling features that determine same-cell responses. Experiments and modeling of single complexes reveal their size, number, and timing relays cytokine-specific control over shared signaling mechanisms with feedback regulation that is independent of transcription. Our results provide evidence for variable-gain stochastic pooling, a noise-reducing motif that enables cytokine-specific regulation and parsimonious information transfer. We propose that emergent properties of stochastic pooling are general principles of receptor signaling that have evolved for constructive information transmission in noisy molecular environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The discovery of human Plasmodium among domestic animals in West Sumba and Fakfak, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Indonesia, malaria incidence is at a high rate despite maximum preventive efforts. Therefore, this study aims to determine the possibility of a Plasmodium reservoir among domestic animals in malaria-endemic areas. Methods:  Animal blood was collected using EDTA tubes, then smeared and stained with Giemsa for Plasmodium microscopic identification. About 10 µl of blood was dropped on to a filter paper to capture Plasmodium DNA. Nested PCR was used for parasite molecular detection, while Plasmodium species were identified using the sequenced DNA. Results: A total of 208 and 62 animal blood samples were collected from Gaura village, West Sumba and Fakfak village, West Papua, Indonesia respectively. In total, 32 samples from Gaura contained P. falciparum or P. vivax, while the Plasmodium percentage in buffalo, horse, goat, and dogs were 20.7%, 14.3%, 5.8%, 16.7%, respectively. P. knowlesi was not found in any of the samples, and no other species were detected in 18 pig blood samples. Conclusion: Human Plasmodium existence among domestic animals in Indonesia partly explains the high prevalence and persistence of malaria in some endemic areas due to a reservoir host presence. Therefore, future studies need to ascertain the cause.

     alt="Morphology of P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like afferent nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia and close relationship with vesicular nucleotide transporter-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the rat gastric antrum"/>
<p>We discovered P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web-like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)-expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web-like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship of P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket-like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net-like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket-like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B-immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket-like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.</p>

Metabolic adaptations to complex perturbations, like the response to pharmacological treatments in multifactorial diseases such as cancer, can be described through measurements of part of the fluxes and concentrations at the systemic level and individual transporter and enzyme activities at the molecular level. In the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), ensembles of linear constraints can be built integrating these measurements at both systemic and molecular levels, which are expressed as relative differences or changes produced in the metabolic adaptation. Here, combining MCA with Linear Programming, an efficient computational strategy is developed to infer additional non-measured changes at the molecular level that are required to satisfy these constraints. An application of this strategy is illustrated by using a set of fluxes, concentrations, and differentially expressed genes that characterize the response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibition in colon cancer cells. Decreases and increases in transporter and enzyme individual activities required to reprogram the measured changes in fluxes and concentrations are compared with down-regulated and up-regulated metabolic genes to unveil those that are key molecular drivers of the metabolic response.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), are believed to play key roles in facilitating the metastatic cascade. Metastatic lesions often exhibit a similar epithelial-like state to that of the primary tumour, in particular, by forming carcinoma cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated junctional complexes. However, the factors enabling mesenchymal-like micrometastatic cells to resume growth and reacquire an epithelial phenotype in the target organ microenvironment remain elusive. In this study, we developed a workflow using image-based cell profiling and machine learning to examine morphological, contextual and molecular states of individual breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). MDA-MB-231 heterogeneous response to the host organ microenvironment was modelled by substrates with controllable stiffness varying from 0.2kPa (soft tissues) to 64kPa (bone tissues). We identified 3 distinct morphological cell types (morphs) varying from compact round-shaped to flattened irregular-shaped cells with lamellipodia, predominantly populating 2-kPa and >16kPa substrates, respectively. These observations were accompanied by significant changes in E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bone-mimicking substrate (64kPa) induced multicellular cluster formation accompanied by E-cadherin cell surface localisation. MDA-MB-231 cells responded to different substrate stiffness by morphological adaptation, changes in proliferation rate and cytoskeleton markers, and cluster formation on bone-mimicking substrate. Our results suggest that the stiffest microenvironment can induce MET.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model explaining mRNA level fluctuations based on activity demands and RNA age</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhongneng Xu, Shuichi Asakawa</p>

Cellular RNA levels typically fluctuate and are influenced by different transcription rates and RNA degradation rates. However, the understanding of the fundamental relationships between RNA abundance, environmental stimuli, RNA activities, and RNA age distributions is incomplete. Furthermore, the rates of RNA degradation and transcription are difficult to measure in transcriptomic experiments in living organisms, especially in studies involving humans. A model based on activity demands and RNA age was developed to explore the mechanisms of RNA level fluctuations. Using single-cell time-series gene expression experimental data, we assessed the transcription rates, RNA degradation rates, RNA life spans, RNA demand, accumulated transcription levels, and accumulated RNA degradation levels. This model could also predict RNA levels under simulation backgrounds, such as stimuli that induce regular oscillations in RNA abundance, stable RNA levels over time that result from long-term shortage of total RNA activity or from uncontrollable transcription, and relationships between RNA/protein levels and metabolic rates. This information contributes to existing knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A  conserved ubiquitin- and ESCRT-dependent pathway internalizes human lysosomal membrane proteins for degradation</a></h4>

The lysosome is an essential organelle to recycle cellular materials and maintain nutrient homeostasis, but the mechanism to down-regulate its membrane proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay to measure the half-lives of approximately 30 human lysosomal membrane proteins (LMPs) and identified RNF152 and LAPTM4A as short-lived membrane proteins. The degradation of both proteins is ubiquitin dependent. RNF152 is a transmembrane E3 ligase that ubiquitinates itself, whereas LAPTM4A uses its carboxyl-terminal PY motifs to recruit NEDD4-1 for ubiquitination. After ubiquitination, they are internalized into the lysosome lumen by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery for degradation. Strikingly, when ectopically expressed in budding yeast, human RNF152 is still degraded by the vacuole (yeast lysosome) in an ESCRT-dependent manner. Thus, our study uncovered a conserved mechanism to down-regulate lysosome membrane proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structure of the human C9orf72-SMCR8 complex reveals a multivalent protein interaction architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Nörpel, Simone Cavadini, Andreas D. Schenk, Alexandra Graff-Meyer, Daniel Hess, Jan Seebacher, Jeffrey A. Chao, Varun Bhaskar</p>

A major cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is the hexanucleotide G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene. Many underlying mechanisms lead to manifestation of disease that include toxic gain of function by repeat G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> RNAs, dipeptide repeat proteins, and a reduction of the C9orf72 gene product. The C9orf72 protein interacts with SMCR8 and WDR41 to form a trimeric complex and regulates multiple cellular pathways including autophagy. Here, we report the structure of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex at 3.8 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure reveals 2 distinct dimerization interfaces between C9orf72 and SMCR8 that involves an extensive network of interactions. Homology between C9orf72-SMCR8 and Folliculin-Folliculin Interacting Protein 2 (FLCN-FNIP2), a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex, enabled identification of a key residue within the active site of SMCR8. Further structural analysis suggested that a coiled-coil region within the uDenn domain of SMCR8 could act as an interaction platform for other coiled-coil proteins, and its deletion reduced the interaction of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex with FIP200 upon starvation. In summary, this study contributes toward our understanding of the biological function of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the current study, we examined the number, distribution, and aspects of the neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), in the brains of a southern lesser galago (<i>Galago moholi</i>), a black-capped squirrel monkey (<i>Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis</i>), and a crested macaque (<i>Macaca nigra</i>). Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most dense close to inner cortical border, decreasing in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN-immunopositive cells revealed estimates of approximately 1.1, 10.8, and 37.7 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the galago, squirrel monkey, and crested macaque, respectively. The total numbers of WMICs form a distinct negative allometric relationship with brain mass and white matter volume when examined in a larger sample of primates where similar measures have been obtained. In all three primates studied, the highest densities of WMICs were in the white matter of the frontal lobe, with the occipital lobe having the lowest. Immunostaining revealed significant subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calretinin, with very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and none containing calbindin. The nNOS and calretinin immunopositive WMICs represent approximately 21% of the total WMIC population; however, variances in the proportions of these neurochemical phenotypes were noted. Our results indicate that both the squirrel monkey and crested macaque might be informative animal models for the study of WMICs in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

                Medical research aims to improve health for everyone. While its advances are undeniable, the pace and cost of the progress are not optimal. For example, independent analyses concluded that at least half of the published biomedical research findings are irreproducible, and most scientific papers are never read or cited. This paper examines biomedical research holistically, as a system of incentives that shape the behavior of scientists, administrators, publishers, and funders, and are detrimental to medical progress. We identify opportunities to change and improve those incentives by altering the way research output is disseminated and evaluated, and recommend transparent, data-driven measures of methodological rigor, reproducibility, and societal value of scientific discoveries. Embracing these opportunities would maximize our investments in biomedical research and optimize its value to human health, while simultaneously increasing freedom, creativity, and satisfaction of the scientific workforce.

                Background  The presence of Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) positive bacteria in hospital setting is an aggravating influential factor for hospitalized patients, and its consequences may be hazardous. Therefore, there is a need for rapid detection methods for newly emerging drug-resistant bacteria. This study was aimed at the molecular characterization of ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from clinical samples.   Methods  A total of 513 K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from various clinical samples during June 2019 to May 2020. The collected isolates were investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility (antibiogram), and PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to analyse the ESBL genes.   Results  Among the 513 isolates, as many as 359 (69.9%) were ESBL producers and 87.5% were multi-drug resistant, while none had resistance to imipenem. PCR scored 3% blaTEM, 3% blaSHV, and 60% blaCTX-M-15 genes for the tested isolates.   Conclusion  The study showed that CTX-M-15 was the major prevalent ESBL type among the isolates. Additionally, all the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Screening and detection of ESBL tests are necessary among all isolates from the enterobacteriaceae family in routine microbiology laboratory to prevent associated nosocomial infections. A larger study is essential to understand molecular epidemiology of ESBL producing organisms to minimize morbidities due to these multidrug resistant organisms.

<p>Upon infection of primary neurons, astrocytes and microglia with tick-borne encephalitis virus, astrocytes mount particularly high IFN-β responses that initially depend on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, is typically transmitted upon tick bite and can cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. In TBEV-infected mice, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the downstream adaptor of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is needed to induce early type I interferon (IFN) responses and to confer protection. To characterize the brain-resident cell subset that produces protective IFN-β in TBEV-infected mice, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from mice and exposed these cell types to TBEV in vitro. Under such conditions, neurons showed the highest percentage of infected cells, whereas astrocytes and microglia were infected to a lesser extent. In the supernatant (SN) of infected neurons, IFN-β was not detectable, while infected astrocytes showed high and microglia low IFN-β expression. Transcriptome analyses of astrocytes implied that MAVS signaling was needed early after TBEV infection. Accordingly, MAVS-deficient astrocytes showed enhanced TBEV infection and significantly reduced early IFN-β responses. Nevertheless, at later time points, moderate amounts of IFN-β were detected in the SN of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Transcriptome analyses indicated that MAVS deficiency negatively affected the induction of early anti-viral responses, which resulted in significantly increased TBEV replication. Treatment with MyD88 and TRIF inhibiting peptides reduced only late IFN-β responses of TBEV-infected WT astrocytes and blocked entirely IFN-β responses of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Thus, upon TBEV exposure of brain-resident cells, astrocytes are important IFN-β producers showing biphasic IFN-β induction that initially depends on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>

     alt="Macaque monkey trigeminal blink reflex circuits targeting levator palpebrae superioris motoneurons"/>
<p>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here, we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.</p>

In this snail, a caudo-dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod-dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod-dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH-immunoreactive cell groups (CDC<sub>COM</sub> and SC<sub>m</sub>) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing <i>CDCH</i>. The CDC<sub>COM</sub> with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in <i>L</i>. <i>stagnalis</i>.</p>

<p>We confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons in the frontoinsular cortex of all animals. Focusing on problem-solving ability, raccoons exhibiting high levels of cognitive flexibility had increased total cell counts (via isotropic fractionation) and higher numbers of fusiform cells (via thionin histology) in the hippocampus.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem-solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high-solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin-based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high-solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We examined the number, distribution, and immunoreactivity of the infracortical white matter neuronal population, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), throughout the telencephalic white matter of an adult female chimpanzee. Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most numerous and dense close to the inner border of cortical layer VI, decreasing significantly in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN-immunopositive cells revealed an estimate of approximately 137.2 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the chimpanzee brain studied. Immunostaining revealed subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, approximately 14.4 million in number), calretinin (CR, approximately 16.7 million), very few WMICs containing parvalbumin (PV), and no calbindin-immunopositive neurons. The nNOS, CR, and PV immunopositive WMICs, possibly all inhibitory neurons, represent approximately 22.6% of the total WMIC population. As the white matter is affected in many cognitive conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and also in neurodegenerative diseases, understanding these neurons across species is important for the translation of findings of neural dysfunction in animal models to humans. Furthermore, studies of WMICs in species such as apes provide a crucial phylogenetic context for understanding the evolution of these cell types in the human brain.</p>

<p>The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the visual regions embodied “columnar and layered” cytoarchitectural motifs, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the mammalian sensory cortices.

The question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway are exceptionally not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso-recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re-entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar-like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino-recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino-recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). “Column-forming” axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto-trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse-topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A transient postnatal quiescent period precedes emergence of mature cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition. Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                DNA methylation has evolved to silence mutagenic transposable elements (TEs) while typically avoiding the targeting of endogenous genes. Mechanisms that prevent DNA methyltransferases from ectopically methylating genes are expected to be of prime importance during periods of dynamic cell cycle activities including plant embryogenesis. However, virtually nothing is known regarding how DNA methyltransferase activities are precisely regulated during embryogenesis to prevent the induction of potentially deleterious and mitotically stable genic epimutations. Here, we report that microRNA-mediated repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) and the chromatin features that CMT3 prefers help prevent ectopic methylation of thousands of genes during embryogenesis that can persist for weeks afterwards. Our results are also consistent with CMT3-induced ectopic methylation of promoters or bodies of genes undergoing transcriptional activation reducing their expression. Therefore, the repression of CMT3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage on endogenous genes. We also provide a model that may help reconcile conflicting viewpoints regarding the functions of gene-body methylation that occurs in nearly all flowering plants.

                The choroid plexus (ChP), an epithelial bilayer containing a network of mesenchymal, immune, and neuronal cells, forms the blood–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB). While best recognized for secreting CSF, the ChP is also a hotbed of immune cell activity and can provide circulating peripheral immune cells with passage into the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review recent studies on ChP immune cells, with a focus on the ontogeny, development, and behaviors of ChP macrophages, the principal resident immune cells of the ChP.
