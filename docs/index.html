              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05319">Different factors determining Motor Execution and Motor Imagery performance in a serial reaction time task with intrinsic variability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor imagery corresponds to the mental practice of simulating visual and kinesthetic aspects of a given motor task. This practice shares a similar neural substrate and correlated temporal scale with motor execution. Besides that, it can lead to performance improvements in the actual execution of the imagined task. Therefore it is important to understand functional differences and equivalences between motor imagery and motor execution. To tackle that we employed a finger-tapping serial reaction time task in two groups of participants, a Motor Execution (n=10) and a Motor imagery (n=10). The sequence of stimuli defining the task had 750 items composed of three distinct auditory stimuli. Also, this sequence had some intrinsic variability making some of the next items unpredictable. Each auditory stimulus was mapped to a single right hand finger in the Motor Imagery group. The Motor imagery group indicated the end of the imagination with a single response using the left hand. The results show improvement in performance of the Motor Imagery group throughout the task and that the duration of the motor imagery, indirectly measured by reaction times, are influenced by distinct factors than those of Motor Execution.

                arXiv:2412.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key problem in deep learning and computational neuroscience is relating the geometrical properties of neural representations to task performance. Here, we consider this problem for continuous decoding tasks where neural variability may affect task precision. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the average-case learning curves for $\varepsilon$-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\varepsilon$-SVR) and discuss its capacity as a measure of linear decodability. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in the training error at a critical load, capturing the interplay between the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$ and neural variability. We uncover a double-descent phenomenon in the generalization error, showing that $\varepsilon$ acts as a regularizer, both suppressing and shifting these peaks. Theoretical predictions are validated both on toy models and deep neural networks, extending the theory of Support Vector Machines to continuous tasks with inherent neural variability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06332">Not All Errors Are Equal: Investigation of Speech Recognition Errors in Alzheimer's Disease Detection</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays an important role in speech-based automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recognition errors could propagate downstream, potentially impacting the detection decisions. Recent studies have revealed a non-linear relationship between word error rates (WER) and AD detection performance, where ASR transcriptions with notable errors could still yield AD detection accuracy equivalent to that based on manual transcriptions. This work presents a series of analyses to explore the effect of ASR transcription errors in BERT-based AD detection systems. Our investigation reveals that not all ASR errors contribute equally to detection performance. Certain words, such as stopwords, despite constituting a large proportion of errors, are shown to play a limited role in distinguishing AD. In contrast, the keywords related to diagnosis tasks exhibit significantly greater importance relative to other words. These findings provide insights into the interplay between ASR errors and the downstream detection model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06740">Convolution goes higher-order: a biologically inspired mechanism empowers image classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.06740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image classification inspired by complex nonlinear biological visual processing, whereby classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equipped with learnable higher-order convolutions. Our model incorporates a Volterra-like expansion of the convolution operator, capturing multiplicative interactions akin to those observed in early and advanced stages of biological visual processing. We evaluated this approach on synthetic datasets by measuring sensitivity to testing higher-order correlations and performance in standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenette). Our architecture outperforms traditional CNN baselines, and achieves optimal performance with expansions up to 3rd/4th order, aligning remarkably well with the distribution of pixel intensities in natural images. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we validate this alignment by isolating the contributions of specific image statistics to model performance, demonstrating how different orders of convolution process distinct aspects of visual information. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis reveals distinct geometries across network layers, indicating qualitatively different modes of visual information processing. Our work bridges neuroscience and deep learning, offering a path towards more effective, biologically inspired computer vision models. It provides insights into visual information processing and lays the groundwork for neural networks that better capture complex visual patterns, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

                arXiv:2403.16382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are the dominant framework for modeling response time (RT) data from speeded decision-making tasks. While providing a good quantitative description of RT data in terms of abstract perceptual representations, EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place. To address this limitation, we introduce the visual accumulator model (VAM), in which convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted to trial-level RTs and raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli from individual subjects in a unified Bayesian framework. Models fitted to large-scale cognitive training data from a stylized flanker task captured individual differences in congruency effects, RTs, and accuracy. We find evidence that the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations, demonstrating how our framework can be used to relate visual representations to behavioral outputs. Together, our work provides a probabilistic framework for both constraining neural network models of vision with behavioral data and studying how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14473">Poisson Variational Autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.14473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) employ Bayesian inference to interpret sensory inputs, mirroring processes that occur in primate vision across both ventral (Higgins et al., 2021) and dorsal (Vafaii et al., 2023) pathways. Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which deviates sharply from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAE encodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.

                arXiv:2412.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models of synaptic plasticity have been proposed to explain the diversity of plasticity phenomena observed in biological organisms. These models range from simple interpretations of Hebb's postulate, which suggests that correlated neural activity leads to increases in synaptic strength, to more complex rules that allow bidirectional synaptic updates, ensure stability, or incorporate additional signals like reward or error. At the same time, a range of learning paradigms can be observed behaviorally, from Pavlovian conditioning to motor learning and memory recall. Although it is difficult to directly link synaptic updates to learning outcomes experimentally, computational models provide a valuable tool for building evidence of this connection. In this chapter, we discuss several fundamental learning paradigms, along with the synaptic plasticity rules that might be used to implement them.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070">Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.24070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems have become a popular tool in both neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Having measures to compare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions, architectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information is transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend, recent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious signals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric and understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to identify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose that the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether metrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout learning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant to computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and RNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more reliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can be used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically, results from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that, in contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent dynamics due to their expressiveness. Overall, by developing test cases, we show DSA's exceptional ability to detect compositional dynamical motifs, thereby enhancing our understanding of how computations unfold in RNNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05305">A Robust Clustering Framework Combining Minimum Description Length and Genetic Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are fundamental in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often face limitations and biases, making it challenging to develop a universal solution for diverse datasets. To address this, we propose a novel clustering framework that combines the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. This approach begins with an ensemble clustering solution as a baseline, which is refined using MDL-based evaluation functions and optimized with a genetic algorithm. By leveraging the MDL principle, the method adapts to the intrinsic properties of datasets, minimizing dependence on input clusters and ensuring a data-driven process. The proposed method was evaluated on thirteen benchmark datasets using four validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Results show that the method consistently outperforms traditional clustering algorithms, achieving higher accuracy, greater stability, and reduced biases. Its adaptability makes it a reliable tool for clustering complex and varied datasets. This study demonstrates the potential of combining MDL and genetic optimization to create a robust and versatile clustering framework, advancing the field of data analysis and offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are amenable to deployment on edge devices and neuromorphic hardware due to their lower dissipation. Recently, SNN-based transformers have garnered significant interest, incorporating attention mechanisms akin to their counterparts in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while demonstrating excellent performance. However, deploying large spiking transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices such as mobile phones, still poses significant challenges resulted from the high computational demands of large uncompressed high-precision models. In this work, we introduce a novel heterogeneous quantization method for compressing spiking transformers through layer-wise quantization. Our approach optimizes the quantization of each layer using one of two distinct quantization schemes, i.e., uniform or power-of-two quantification, with mixed bit resolutions. Our heterogeneous quantization demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining high performance for spiking transformers while utilizing an average effective resolution of 3.14-3.67 bits with less than a 1% accuracy drop on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS datasets. It attains a model compression rate of 8.71x-10.19x for standard floating-point spiking transformers. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a significant energy reduction of 5.69x, 8.72x, and 10.2x while maintaining high accuracy levels of 85.3%, 97.57%, and 80.4% on N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, respectively.

                arXiv:2412.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) provide a brain-inspired and event-driven mechanism that is believed to be critical to unlock energy-efficient deep learning. The mixture-of-experts approach mirrors the parallel distributed processing of nervous systems, introducing conditional computation policies and expanding model capacity without scaling up the number of computational operations. Additionally, spiking mixture-of-experts self-attention mechanisms enhance representation capacity, effectively capturing diverse patterns of entities and dependencies between visual or linguistic tokens. However, there is currently a lack of hardware support for highly parallel distributed processing needed by spiking transformers, which embody a brain-inspired computation. This paper introduces the first 3D hardware architecture and design methodology for Mixture-of-Experts and Multi-Head Attention spiking transformers. By leveraging 3D integration with memory-on-logic and logic-on-logic stacking, we explore such brain-inspired accelerators with spatially stackable circuitry, demonstrating significant optimization of energy efficiency and latency compared to conventional 2D CMOS integration.

                arXiv:2412.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.

                arXiv:2412.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting complex neural networks is crucial for understanding their decision-making processes, particularly in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. This proposed method addresses this need by focusing on layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique used in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attribute neural network outputs to input features through backpropagated relevance scores. Existing LRP methods often struggle with precision in evaluating individual neuron contributions. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach that improves the parsing of selected neurons during LRP backward propagation, using the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture as a case study. Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Additionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to reconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner workings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and supports the development of more transparent artificial intelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications. This advancement has the potential to improve the trustworthiness of AI models in real-world machine vision applications, thereby increasing their reliability and effectiveness.

                arXiv:2412.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient spatio-temporal data processing owing to their dynamic nature. This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.

                arXiv:2412.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learnable evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated the importance of leveraging population distribution information and historical evolutionary trajectories. While significant progress has been made in continuous optimization domains, combinatorial optimization problems remain challenging due to their discrete nature and complex solution spaces. To address this gap, we propose SeqMO, a novel learnable multi-objective combinatorial optimization method that integrates sequence-to-sequence models with evolutionary algorithms. Our approach divides approximate Pareto solution sets based on their objective values' distance to the Pareto front, and establishes mapping relationships between solutions by minimizing objective vector angles in the target space. This mapping creates structured training data for pointer networks, which learns to predict promising solution trajectories in the discrete search space. The trained model then guides the evolutionary process by generating new candidate solutions while maintaining population diversity. Experiments on the multi-objective travel salesman problem and the multi-objective quadratic assignment problem verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

                arXiv:2412.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in spiking neural networks (SNNs) have a predominant focus on network architectures, while relatively little attention has been paid to the underlying neuron model. The point neuron models, a cornerstone of deep SNNs, pose a bottleneck on the network-level expressivity since they depict somatic dynamics only. In contrast, the multi-compartment models in neuroscience offer remarkable expressivity by introducing dendritic morphology and dynamics, but remain underexplored in deep learning due to their unaffordable computational cost and inflexibility. To combine the advantages of both sides for a flexible, efficient yet more powerful model, we propose the dendritic spiking neuron (DendSN) incorporating multiple dendritic branches with nonlinear dynamics. Compared to the point spiking neurons, DendSN exhibits significantly higher expressivity. DendSN's flexibility enables its seamless integration into diverse deep SNN architectures. To accelerate dendritic SNNs (DendSNNs), we parallelize dendritic state updates across time steps, and develop Triton kernels for GPU-level acceleration. As a result, we can construct large-scale DendSNNs with depth comparable to their point SNN counterparts. Next, we comprehensively evaluate DendSNNs' performance on various demanding tasks. By modulating dendritic branch strengths using a context signal, catastrophic forgetting of DendSNNs is substantially mitigated. Moreover, DendSNNs demonstrate enhanced robustness against noise and adversarial attacks compared to point SNNs, and excel in few-shot learning settings. Our work firstly demonstrates the possibility of training bio-plausible dendritic SNNs with depths and scales comparable to traditional point SNNs, and reveals superior expressivity and robustness of reduced dendritic neuron models in deep learning, thereby offering a fresh perspective on advancing neural network design.

                arXiv:2412.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained considerable attention as a platform for establishing aerial wireless networks and communications. However, the line-of-sight dominance in air-to-ground communications often leads to significant interference with terrestrial networks, reducing communication efficiency among terrestrial terminals. This paper explores a novel uplink interference mitigation approach based on the collaborative beamforming (CB) method in multi-UAV network systems. Specifically, the UAV swarm forms a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (VAA) to achieve the transmissions of gathered data to multiple base stations (BSs) for data backup and distributed processing. However, there is a trade-off between the effectiveness of CB-based interference mitigation and the energy conservation of UAVs. Thus, by jointly optimizing the excitation current weights and hover position of UAVs as well as the sequence of data transmission to various BSs, we formulate an uplink interference mitigation multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to decrease interference affection, enhance transmission efficiency, and improve energy efficiency, simultaneously. In response to the computational demands of the formulated problem, we introduce an evolutionary computation method, namely chaotic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CNSGA-II) with multiple improved operators. The proposed CNSGA-II efficiently addresses the formulated MOOP, outperforming several other comparative algorithms, as evidenced by the outcomes of the simulations. Moreover, the proposed CB-based uplink interference mitigation approach can significantly reduce the interference caused by UAVs to non-receiving BSs.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked reservoirs. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively. By predicting the concentration rate, we are able to accurately model the transport process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our neural operator approach achieves accuracy comparable to that of the finite element method. The previously introduced Enriched DeepONet architecture has been revised, motivated by the architecture of the popular multi-head attention of transformers, to improve its performance without increasing the compute cost. The computational efficiency of the proposed model enables rapid and accurate predictions of solute transport, facilitating the optimization of reservoir management strategies and the assessment of environmental impacts.

Abstract: This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.

                arXiv:2412.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection in event streams has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, demonstrating superior performance in low-light conditions, scenarios with motion blur, and rapid movements. Current detectors leverage spiking neural networks, Transformers, or convolutional neural networks as their core architectures, each with its own set of limitations including restricted performance, high computational overhead, or limited local receptive fields. This paper introduces a novel MoE (Mixture of Experts) heat conduction-based object detection algorithm that strikingly balances accuracy and computational efficiency. Initially, we employ a stem network for event data embedding, followed by processing through our innovative MoE-HCO blocks. Each block integrates various expert modules to mimic heat conduction within event streams. Subsequently, an IoU-based query selection module is utilized for efficient token extraction, which is then channeled into a detection head for the final object detection process. Furthermore, we are pleased to introduce EvDET200K, a novel benchmark dataset for event-based object detection. Captured with a high-definition Prophesee EVK4-HD event camera, this dataset encompasses 10 distinct categories, 200,000 bounding boxes, and 10,054 samples, each spanning 2 to 5 seconds. We also provide comprehensive results from over 15 state-of-the-art detectors, offering a solid foundation for future research and comparison.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can offer ultra-low power/energy consumption for machine learning-based application tasks due to their sparse spike-based operations. Currently, most of the SNN architectures need a significantly larger model size to achieve higher accuracy, which is not suitable for resource-constrained embedded applications. Therefore, developing SNNs that can achieve high accuracy with acceptable memory footprint is highly needed. Toward this, we propose SpiKernel, a novel methodology that improves the accuracy of SNNs through kernel size exploration. Its key steps include (1) investigating the impact of different kernel sizes on the accuracy, (2) devising new sets of kernel sizes, (3) generating SNN architectures using neural architecture search based on the selected kernel sizes, and (4) analyzing the accuracy-memory trade-offs for SNN model selection. The experimental results show that our SpiKernel achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art works (i.e., 93.24% for CIFAR10, 70.84% for CIFAR100, and 62% for TinyImageNet) with less than 10M parameters and up to 4.8x speed-up of searching time, thereby making it suitable for embedded applications.

                arXiv:2406.02507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.

                arXiv:2411.08674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.

                arXiv:2411.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility. These findings validate the efficacy of FabuLight-ASD in enhancing ASD performance through the integration of body pose data. FabuLight-ASD's code and model weights are available at https://github.com/knowledgetechnologyuhh/FabuLight-ASD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93117">UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation of N-glycan competes with ER-associated degradation of unstable and misfolded glycoproteins</a></h4>

              
                How the fate (folding versus degradation) of glycoproteins is determined in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intriguing question. Monoglucosylated glycoproteins are recognized by lectin chaperones to facilitate their folding, whereas glycoproteins exposing well-trimmed mannoses are subjected to glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD); we have elucidated how mannoses are sequentially trimmed by EDEM family members (George et al., 2020; 2021 eLife). Although reglucosylation by UGGT was previously reported to have no effect on substrate degradation, here we directly tested this notion using cells with genetically disrupted UGGT1/2. Strikingly, the results showed that UGGT1 delayed the degradation of misfolded substrates and unstable glycoproteins including ATF6α. An experiment with a point mutant of UGGT1 indicated that the glucosylation activity of UGGT1 was required for the inhibition of early glycoprotein degradation. These and overexpression-based competition experiments suggested that the fate of glycoproteins is determined by a tug-of-war between structure formation by UGGT1 and degradation by EDEMs. We further demonstrated the physiological importance of UGGT1, since ATF6α cannot function properly without UGGT1. Thus, our work strongly suggests that UGGT1 is a central factor in ER protein quality control via the regulation of both glycoprotein folding and degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102592">Paracrine rescue of MYR1-deficient Toxoplasma gondii mutants reveals limitations of pooled in vivo CRISPR screens</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is an intracellular parasite that subverts host cell functions via secreted virulence factors. Up to 70% of parasite-controlled changes in the host transcriptome rely on the MYR1 protein, which is required for the translocation of secreted proteins into the host cell. Mice infected with MYR1 knock-out (KO) strains survive infection, supporting a paramount function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence and proliferation. However, we have previously shown that MYR1 mutants have no growth defect in pooled <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR-Cas9 screens in mice, suggesting that the presence of parasites that are wild-type at the <i>myr1</i> locus in pooled screens can rescue the phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that MYR1 is not required for the survival in IFN-γ-activated murine macrophages, and that parasites lacking MYR1 are able to expand during the onset of infection. While ΔMYR1 parasites have restricted growth in single-strain murine infections, we show that the phenotype is rescued by co-infection with wild-type (WT) parasites <i>in vivo</i>, independent of host functional adaptive immunity or key pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data show that the major function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is not to protect the parasite from clearance within infected cells. Instead, MYR-dependent proteins generate a permissive niche in a paracrine manner, which rescues ΔMYR1 parasites within a pool of CRISPR mutants in mice. Our results highlight an important limitation of otherwise powerful <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR screens and point towards key functions for MYR1-dependent <i>Toxoplasma</i>-host interactions beyond the infected cell.

                <p>Unique microglial states have been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and postmortem AD brains. Although it has been well documented that amyloid-&beta; accumulation induces the alteration of microglial states, the relationship between tau pathology and microglial states remains incompletely understood because of a lack of suitable AD models. In the present study, we generated a novel AD model mouse by the intracerebral administration of tau purified from human brains with primary age-related tauopathy into <I>App</I> knock-in mice with humanized tau. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Dectin-1-positive disease-associated microglia were increased in the AD model mice after tau accumulation in the brain. We then performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on the AD model mice to evaluate the differences in microglial states with and without tau propagation and accumulation. By taking advantage of spatial transcriptomics and existing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we showed for the first time that tau propagation and accumulation induce a disease-associated microglial phenotype at the expense of an age-related nonhomeostatic counterpart (namely, white matter-associated microglia) in an AD model mouse brain. Future work using spatial transcriptomics at single-cell resolution will pave the way for a more appropriate interpretation of microglial alterations in response to tau pathology in the AD brain.</p>

                <p>When making perceptual decisions, humans combine information across sensory modalities dependent on their respective uncertainties. However, it remains unknown how the brain integrates multisensory feedback during movement and which factors besides sensory uncertainty influence sensory contributions. We performed two reaching experiments on healthy adults to investigate whether movement corrections to combined visual and mechanical perturbations scale with visual uncertainty. To describe the dynamics of multimodal feedback responses, we further varied movement time and visual feedback duration during the movement. The results of our first experiment show that the contribution of visual feedback decreased with uncertainty. Additionally, we observed a transient phase during which visual feedback responses were stronger during faster movements. In a follow-up experiment, we found that the contribution of vision increased more quickly during slow movements when we presented the visual feedback for a longer time. Muscle activity corresponding to these visual responses exhibited modulations with sensory uncertainty and movement speed ca. 100&nbsp;ms following the onset of the visual feedback. Using an optimal feedback control model, we show that the increased response to visual feedback during fast movements can be explained by an urgency-dependent increase in control gains. Further, the fact that a longer viewing duration increased the visual contributions suggests that the brain accumulates sensory information over time to estimate the state of the arm during reaching. Our results provide additional evidence concerning the link between reaching control and decision-making, both of which appear to be influenced by sensory evidence accumulation and response urgency.</p>

                Complexities in obturation and difficulties in disinfection represent significant issues that render endodontic treatment notably time-consuming. A new perspective is essential to reduce both working time and address these two challenges. To date, none of the established techniques for root canal obturation can assure a perfect seal. Solid materials are not easily manipulated to hermetically fill the intricate branches of the root canal system. Concurrently, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, particularly Enterococcus faecalis, are predominant in discussions surrounding endodontic infections. Numerous studies have demonstrated that achieving complete disinfection of Enterococcus faecalis is exceedingly difficult, even with the use of irrigating solutions that possess strong antibacterial properties. Under anaerobic conditions, the invasion efficiency of facultative anaerobes is heightened. If irrigation and disinfection fail to entirely eliminate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, a novel strategy is required to address the bacteria that persist within the root canal. Oxygen can easily permeate the root canal system, eradicate anaerobes, and inhibit facultative anaerobes from becoming pathogenic. Therefore, employing oxygen as a biomaterial for obturation following appropriate cleaning and shaping procedures is anticipated to address the two primary endodontic issues. This article aims to explore a new potential concept for a dental restoration system that utilizes an oxygen-permeable membrane to reduce the time required for endodontic treatment. The membrane is positioned at the orifice of a duct designed to connect the entire root canal system with ambient air outside the restoration. The function of the membrane is somewhat analogous to the masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allows for the circulation of oxygen while preventing the passage of fluids, debris, and microorganisms. We hypothesize that the oxygen circulating within the root canal system will also function as a continuously renewing antimicrobial agent.

First, data is collected to analyse and understand the current organisation’s performance management system. Second, the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) method is used to identify the main aspects of the performance management system to be improved. Third, based on the scientific literature and SWOT analysis, BSC principles are integrated to this performance management system to better align the organisation’s performance objectives and indicators with its strategy. Finally, we develop a performance indicator structure and select indicators to be used as well as how these indicators could be integrated and shared with higher hierarchical levels in the organisation by using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Our approach is applied to the CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’île-de-Montreal (CCSMTL), a large healthcare network, in the province of Québec, Canada.

Pangenomes are becoming a powerful framework to perform many bioinformatics analyses taking into account the genetic variability of a population, thus reducing the bias introduced by a single reference genome. With the wider diffusion of pangenomes, integrating genetic variability with transcriptome diversity is becoming a natural extension that demands specific methods for its exploration. In this work, we extend the notion of spliced pangenomes to that of <i>annotated spliced pangenomes</i>; this allows us to introduce a formal definition of Alternative Splicing (AS) events on a graph structure. To investigate the usage of graph pangenomes for the quantification of AS events across conditions, we developed pantas, the first pangenomic method for the detection and differential analysis of AS events from short RNA-Seq reads. A comparison with state-of-the-art linear reference-based approaches proves that pantas achieves competitive accuracy, making spliced pangenomes effective for conducting AS events quantification and opening future directions for the analysis of population-based transcriptomes.

Publicly available data sets of contact data are however typically recorded over short time windows with respect to the duration of an epidemic. To inform models of disease transmission, data are thus often repeated several times, yielding synthetic data covering long enough timescales. Looping over short term data to approximate contact patterns on longer timescales can lead to unrealistic transmission chains because of the deterministic repetition of all contacts, without any renewal of the contact partners of each individual between successive periods. Real contacts indeed include a combination of regularly repeated contacts (e.g., due to friendship relations) and of more casual ones. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to longitudinally extend contact data recorded in a school setting, taking into account this dual aspect of contacts and in particular the presence of repeated contacts due to friendships. To illustrate the interest of such an algorithm, we then simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on our synthetic contacts using an agent-based model specific to the school setting. We compare the results with simulations performed on synthetic data extended with simpler algorithms to determine the impact of preserving friendships in the data extension method. Notably, the preservation of friendships does not strongly affect transmission routes between classes in the school but leads to different infection pathways between individual students. Our results moreover indicate that gathering contact data during two days in a population is sufficient to generate realistic synthetic contact sequences between individuals in that population on longer timescales. The proposed tool will allow modellers to leverage existing contact data, and contributes to the design of optimal future field data collection.

The importance of maintaining data privacy and complying with regulatory requirements is highlighted especially when sharing omic data between different research centers. This challenge is even more pronounced in the scenario where a multi-center effort for collaborative omics studies is necessary. OmicSHIELD is introduced as an open-source tool aimed at overcoming these challenges by enabling privacy-protected federated analysis of sensitive omic data. In order to ensure this, multiple security mechanisms have been included in the software. This innovative tool is capable of managing a wide range of omic data analyses specifically tailored to biomedical research. These include genome and epigenome wide association studies and differential gene expression analyses. OmicSHIELD is designed to support both meta- and mega-analysis, so that it offers a wide range of capabilities for different analysis designs. We present a series of use cases illustrating some examples of how the software addresses real-world analyses of omic data.

Small GTPases of the Rho family play a central role in the regulation of cell motility by controlling the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In the amoeboid cells of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the active form of the Rho GTPase Rac1 regulates actin polymerases at the leading edge and actin filament bundling proteins at the posterior cortex of polarized cells. We monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of Rac1 and its effector DGAP1 in vegetative amoebae using specific fluorescent probes. We observed that plasma membrane domains enriched in active Rac1 not only exhibited stable polarization, but also showed rotations and oscillations, whereas DGAP1 was depleted from these regions. To simulate the observed dynamics of the two proteins, we developed a mass-conserving reaction-diffusion model based on the circulation of Rac1 between the membrane and the cytoplasm coupled with its activation by GEFs, deactivation by GAPs and interaction with DGAP1. Our theoretical model accurately reproduced the experimentally observed dynamic patterns, including the predominant anti-correlation between active Rac1 and DGAP1. Significantly, the model predicted a new colocalization regime of these two proteins in polarized cells, which we confirmed experimentally. In summary, our results improve the understanding of Rac1 dynamics and reveal how the occurrence and transitions between different regimes depend on biochemical reaction rates, protein levels and cell size. This study not only expands our knowledge of the behavior of Rac1 GTPases in <i>D</i>. <i>discoideum</i> amoebae but also demonstrates how specific modes of interaction between Rac1 and its effector DGAP1 lead to their counterintuitively anti-correlated dynamics.

                <p>by Nelio T. L. Rodrigues, Tom Bland, KangBo Ng, Nisha Hirani, Nathan W. Goehring</p>

A key challenge in the development of an organism is to maintain robust phenotypic outcomes in the face of perturbation. Yet, it is often unclear how such robust outcomes are encoded by developmental networks. Here, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> zygote as a model to understand sources of developmental robustness during PAR polarity-dependent asymmetric cell division. By quantitatively linking alterations in protein dosage to phenotype in individual embryos, we show that spatial information in the zygote is read out in a highly nonlinear fashion and, as a result, phenotypes are highly canalized against substantial variation in input signals. Our data point towards robustness of the conserved PAR polarity network that renders polarity axis specification resistant to variations in both the strength of upstream symmetry-breaking cues and PAR protein dosage. Analogously, downstream pathways involved in cell size and fate asymmetry are robust to dosage-dependent changes in the local concentrations of PAR proteins, implying nontrivial complexity in translating PAR concentration profiles into pathway outputs. We propose that these nonlinear signal-response dynamics between symmetry-breaking, PAR polarity, and asymmetric division modules effectively insulate each individual module from variation arising in others. This decoupling helps maintain the embryo along the correct developmental trajectory, thereby ensuring that asymmetric division is robust to perturbation. Such modular organization of developmental networks is likely to be a general mechanism to achieve robust developmental outcomes.

                Background Universal access to maternal, newborn, and child healthcare is essential for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, but the effectiveness of various incentive-based programs for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains uncertain. Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Methods We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Results Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. Conclusion The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.

[version 6; peer review: 1 approve</a></h4>

              
                The haemorrhagic features of viral haemorrhagic fevers may be caused by common patterns of metabolic disturbances of the glucose and ascorbate homeostasis. Haemorrhages and vasculature disfunctions are a clinical feature not only of viral haemorrhagic fevers, but also in scurvy, diabetes and thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Interestingly, the expression of glucose and ascorbate transporter Glut-1 on the erythrocyte membrane is associated with the inability to synthesize ascorbate and is restricted to that very species that are susceptible to filoviruses (primates, humans and fruit bats). Glut-1 may play a pivotal role in haemorrhagic fever pathogenesis. TIM-1 and TAM receptors have been recognized to enhance entry of Ebola, Lassa and Dengue viruses and viral interferences with TIM-1 could disturb its function, disturbing the expression of Glut-1. In those species not able to synthesize ascorbate and expressing Glut-1 on erythrocytes virus could interact with Glut-1 or other functionally related protein, and the influx of glucose into the cells would be severely impaired. As a consequence, transient hyperglycemia and a marked oxidative stress coupled with the high levels of glucose in plasma would be established, and then promote the activation of NF–κB transcription, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response mediated by cytokines and chemokines: The inability to synthesize ascorbate is an Achilles Heel when trying to counteract the oxidative stress.

                Introduction OOPE for healthcare services is a major concern within the Indian healthcare system. 30% of the population remains uninsured despite increasing health insurance coverage. For obstetrics and gynaecology (OBG) patients financial obstacles like OOPE can delay access to health care, evaluating spending patterns can inform policies to enhance accessibility, affordability and equitable health. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Karnataka state of India to analyze OOPE for 905 OBG patients who underwent Cesarean Section(C-Section), Laparoscopic Hysterectomy, Laparoscopic Cystectomy, Laparoscopic Myomectomy and Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH). These were the top five most performed obstetrics and gynecology surgeries in the tertiary care teaching hospital between January 2023 and July 2023. Data was collected across AB-PMJAY, private health insurance, uninsured patients and analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, median) and the Shapiro-Wilk test for data normality. Results The study analyzed OOPE across 905 OBG patients. Findings show AB-PMJAY provided full coverage with zero OOPE for all surgeries. Though private health insurance reduced OOPE compared to uninsured patients under private health insurance still faced significant financial burden. Variations existed in minimum and maximum OOPE and percentage of OOPE across different private insurances. All the uninsured patients incurred 100% OOPE, with a median OOPE of Rs. 33,257 (405.67 USD) to Rs. 57,053 (695.76 USD) and a mean OOPE of Rs. 39,848 (485.95 USD) to Rs. 60,687 (740 USD) across the surgeries. Discussion Findings of the study show that AB-PMJAY is highly effective in reducing OOPE and enhancing financial risk protection for OBG patients. Patients covered by private health insurance incurred less OOPE, yet the burden remained considerable. High OOPE rates for uninsured patients (100%) and private health insurance (38.15%) compared to 0% OOPE in AB-PMJAY emphasizes the need for the continued expansion of AB-PMJAY.

                Introduction The increasing number of older people and their vulnerability to disaster and medication preparedness as the primary elements of disaster mitigation are necessary to reduce the impact of a disaster. Nevertheless, research on natural disasters and medication preparedness in the elderly population is still lacking. This review aimed to explore all reported research and publications related to natural disasters and medication preparedness among the elderly. Methods A scoping review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A literature search was conducted using the following four databases: Scopus, PubMed, Sage, and Google Scholar. Screening was conducted using the following criteria: articles written in English, open access, and published between 2020 and 2024. Articles must discuss natural disasters and medication preparedness. In the data search, we input several keywords that include “elderly,” “natural disaster,” “preparedness,” and “medication.” Snowballing was then conducted to find articles on preparedness interventions. Data extraction and analysis were then performed. Results and conclusion The findings from this literature review are the majority of studies showing that most elderly people are not well prepared in facing disasters; however, through various programs that have been implemented by either the government or community, the elderly show more preparation when they encounter any natural disaster.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater incidence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                Traditional educational frameworks in Saudi Arabia have historically adopted a deficit-based approach to special education, potentially overlooking the benefits of neurodiversity. As global educational paradigms shift toward inclusive practices, examining the alignment of Saudi special education laws with neurodiversity principles becomes crucial. This content analysis study aimed to explore the existing literature on special education in Saudi Arabia to ascertain whether the laws and policies support or hinder the practice of neurodiversity, a concept that is gaining international recognition but remains nascent in Saudi Arabia. A systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science and Scopus, yielding 21 relevant studies after screening and application of inclusion criteria. A content analysis was conducted, focusing on the categorization of data relevant to special education laws and their implications for neurodiversity. The analysis identified seven key categories, including Implementation of Inclusive education and transition services, that reflect the current state of special education laws in relation to neurodiversity. A conceptual model was developed, illustrating the potential of special education laws to both support and impede neurodiversity in Saudi Arabia and potentially worldwide.

                Background The evolving landscape of the African higher education sector necessitated by global higher education reforms and the need for research informed responses to address contextual challenges is partly dependent on effective postgraduate research supervision. A wide range of postgraduate research supervision models and practices are documented globally. In the African context, the experiences of postgraduate research supervision are not clearly understood from the experiences of all stakeholders. Aim The proposed scoping review aims to map evidence on the range of postgraduate research supervision experiences at higher education institutions in Africa. Methods The methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley will be used to conduct the review. Relevant articles will be sourced from different electronic data bases namely; ERIC, Web of Science, EbscoHost and Scopus. A combination of search terms and Boolean operators will be used to obtain the relevant articles based on the inclusion criteria stipulated within the Population, Context and Concept (PCC) framework of study identification for this review. Results Studies reporting on postgraduate research supervision experiences from the perspective of academics, students and support staff in the African higher education context will be included. The results may also provide insights postgraduate supervision experiences from varying postgraduate research disciplines. Conclusion The findings will provide consolidated empirical evidence on experiences of postgraduate supervision in the African higher education context, thereby providing holistic insight on postgraduate research supervision practices, models currently used, implementation challenges and highlight research gaps. This may inform recommendations that advance knowledge within this field, particularly in the African higher education context.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1508/v1?src=rss">Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapy of cystocele: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, is known for its regenerative properties. PRP may be able to help with cystocele cases. This review aims to explore how it might be applied to urogynecological cases, particularly those involving cystocele. Methods The present systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline 2020, Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline. The present systematic review was registered with PROSPERO with the registered number CRD42023414366. PubMed, Science Direct, Epistemonikos, COCHRANE, Google Scholar, and ProQuest were among the databases we searched. “(PRP OR Platelet-Rich Plasma) AND (Cystocele OR Anterior Pelvic Organ Prolapse)” from January 2007 to December 2022. Based on the PICO framework (Population = Patients with Cystocele; Intervention = Reconstruction with platelet-rich plasma injection; Compare = Reconstruction only; Outcome: Recurrency of Cystocele), four investigators (AMS, PMA, EAU, RSD, and AH) independently assessed eligibility by titles and abstracts. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool, each author evaluated full-text articles based on the kind of articles they had received. When consensus could not be obtained, disagreements were settled by involving the supervisors (EF, EMK, and BS). Results A total of 8,924 studies were identified. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, two articles were included, encompassing 65 patients. In two studies, PRP injections were found and administered post-anterior colporrhaphy at the pubovesical fascia. According to these two trials, women who had anterior colporrhaphy and PRP injections required fewer reoperations. Conclusion PRP has the potential to be a good alternative treatment to prevent cystocele recurrence. However, it cannot be generalized to large populations due to the small number of findings. Further studies with large samples examining the efficacy and safety of the therapy are needed to prove it.

                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

                Introduction The social media landscape has undergone radical changes and has revolutionized consumer perspectives, purchasing habits, and behaviours. Amidst this emerging trend is the rise of influencer marketing and its impact on the purchase intentions of followers. The objective is to explore the characteristics of influencers that contribute to their credibility. This research aims to explore the role of consumers’ attitude toward brands on their intention to adopt brands endorsed by influencers. Methods This cross-sectional research was undertaken among GenZ in the urban landscape of India. Data collected was analyzed using SmartPLS4 software. Findings Trust, expertise, and similarity were the significant antecedents of the formation of influencer credibility. Attractiveness did not have a significant influence on influencer credibility. A complementary partial mediation of Attitude towards a brand is observed in the association between influencer credibility and the purchase intention of followers. Attitude towards the video also had a significant positive influence on purchase intention. Conclusion The study found that Gen Z places little importance on an influencer’s attractiveness, as it has no significant impact on credibility. However, attitude toward the brand strongly influenced purchase intention and partially mediated the relationship between influencer credibility and purchase intention.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1506/v1?src=rss">SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW: SERVANT LEADERSHIP IN PUBLIC SECTORS [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Servant leadership delivers important reforms to the increasingly complex public utility system. This systematic review seeks to incorporate the latest six years of articles on geographic divisions, conceptual definitions, measuring techniques, theoretical frameworks, and nomological networks (antecedents, mediators, outcomes, and moderators) in the public sector. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and ROBINS-I, and employing automated techniques such as Rayyan for screening. Using PRISMA’s review approach, this comprehensive synthesis of 51 relevant public sector-specific conceptual and empirical studies across six academic electronic databases (Taylor & Francis, Sage, Scopus, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley) shows that servant leadership is critical for establishing a prosocial workforce. This review discovered that the global construct of servant leadership (SL-7) scale has been the most often utilised measure of servant leadership in public sector-specific studies recently. Social exchange theory remains the predominant explanation for the impact of servant leadership on specific variables. The findings also illustrate a generally positive influence of servant leadership. Moreover, this review provides limitations and suggestions for future studies by summarising elements that have received less attention.

                In the Americas, the expansion in incidence of arboviral infections including Mayaro virus (MAYV) has drawn attention to the resurgence of viruses associated with understudied arthropods. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Haemagogus are generally geographically restricted to the forests of Central and South America and the Caribbean and are the known sylvan vectors for yellow fever virus and emerging MAYV. With an established population in Jamaica, Haemagogus equinus has been reported to be well-adapted to oviposition in artificial containers close to human populations. Its role in arboviral transmission however is not fully understood. Given the dearth of genetic information and the difficulty in morphologically identifying cryptic features in species belonging to this genus, we report the first mitochondrial genome of Hg. equinus. Using a genome skimming approach, two Hg. equinus mosquito specimens were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. A representative mitogenome of 16,471 bp, 80.7% AT and 37 genes was assembled using NOVOplasty. Phylogenetic analysis placed Hg. equinus in the Albomaculatus section of the Haemagogus subgenus supporting previously described taxonomic studies.

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

                Background Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. Methods ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. Results GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. Conclusions Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.

                Background Hybrid and gold open-access (OA) are the most common publishing models. The latter requires fees to allow full-text visibility upon publishing, whereas hybrid journals offer the option to publish gold OA or for free (subscription-based) where only users with access can get the full-text. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the publishing model and other factors on medical journals’ impact. Methods A sample of hybrid and gold OA medical journals indexed in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus were included. The effect of the publishing model and other factors on journals’ impact factor (IF), CiteScore, quartile, and number of citations was assessed. Results 402 journals were included, 201 in each group. Hybrid and gold OA journals had a median age of 32 and 21 years, respectively (P<0.001). The median publishing cost in gold OA journals was $2,690, and 46.3% of them publish continuously. Publishing model, journal’s age, being of an organization/society, and EMBASE indexation didn’t affect IF, CiteScore, number of citations, and WOS quartile (P>0.05). However, gold OA model wasn’t significantly associated with Q1 ranking in Scopus (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.94; P=0.032), which indicates that hybrid journals were more likely to have such ranking. Conclusion These findings indicate that gold OA publishing doesn’t necessarily result in higher impact, which contradicts the claim that such model enhances citations. Therefore, authors can continue to publish in hybrid journals without being concerned about getting cited. Gold OA journals are encouraged to reduce their fees to facilitate global research access.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23664?af=R">Long‐Term Potentiation: The Accidental Discovery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), is a type of synaptic plasticity now considered essential for learning and memory. Here I tell the story of how I accidentally discovered in 1966 in the laboratory of Per Andersen in Oslo, Norway, because I was not looking for it. It just emerged. I recount how I came to work with Per and why my result was not immediately followed up. Then, in 1968 Tim Bliss joined the lab and, on his urging, from 1968 to 1969 we did the experiments that resulted in Bliss and Lømo, 1973. I explain why I think the experiments later failed in Oslo, and for a few years also in Tim's lab in London, before it became a readily observable phenomenon. I also describe how Tony Gardner-Medwin and I in 1971 failed to reproduce the results that Tim and I had obtained 2 years earlier in the same lab and the same type of anesthetized rabbit preparation. I tell how this failure caused me to leave the LTP field and, instead, continue exploring mechanisms of nerve–muscle interactions, which I had studied with much success during my postdoc period in London from 1969 to 1971. I reflect on Donald Hebb's influence on LTP studies and on my experience when after many years of neglect, I became interested in LTP and the hippocampus anew and started to write about it, though without doing lab experiments. Finally, I report briefly on the experiments I am doing now in retirement, studying how the nervous system regulates body temperature through varying amounts of muscle tone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23655?af=R">Adult Neurogenesis in the Human Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus there are neuronal stem cells that give rise to immature neurons and subsequently to mature functional granule neurons. The rate of proliferation, differentiation, and survival is regulated intrinsically and extrinsically. For example, Wnt, BMP, TLX, and BDNF all regulate adult neurogenesis intrinsically, while exercise, environmental enrichment, stress, and epilepsy are some of the extrinsic factors that regulate adult neurogenesis. A clearer picture is emerging for the functional role of these newly born neurons in behavior, demonstrating that adult neurogenesis plays a role in recognizing events, places, objects, or people as unique when comparing options that are very similar, but that these newly born cells play little role in recognition when differences are greater. Most of the research on adult neurogenesis is conducted in experimental mammals, including mice and rats. The first evidence for adult neurogenesis in humans was reported in 1998, when postmortem brains from cancer patients injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were examined and cells were found that had divided and differentiated into mature neurons. Subsequently, additional evidence using other techniques has confirmed human adult neurogenesis. Additional in vivo live reports will be needed to monitor the effects of changes in human adult neurogenesis with age and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97615">Polarised moonlight guides nocturnal bull ants home</a></h4>

              
                For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93405">Pharmacologically inducing regenerative cardiac cells by small molecule drugs</a></h4>

              
                Adult mammals, unlike some lower organisms, lack the ability to regenerate damaged hearts through cardiomyocytes (CMs) dedifferentiation into cells with regenerative capacity. Developing conditions to induce such naturally unavailable cells with potential to proliferate and differentiate into CMs, that is, regenerative cardiac cells (RCCs), in mammals will provide new insights and tools for heart regeneration research. In this study, we demonstrate that a two-compound combination, CHIR99021 and A-485 (2C), effectively induces RCCs from human embryonic stem cell-derived TNNT2<sup>+</sup> CMs in vitro, as evidenced by lineage tracing experiments. Functional analysis shows that these RCCs express a broad spectrum of cardiogenesis genes and have the potential to differentiate into functional CMs, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Importantly, similar results were observed in neonatal rat CMs both in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, administering 2C in adult mouse hearts significantly enhances survival and improves heart function post-myocardial infarction. Mechanistically, CHIR99021 is crucial for the transcriptional and epigenetic activation of genes essential for RCC development, while A-485 primarily suppresses H3K27Ac and particularly H3K9Ac in CMs. Their synergistic effect enhances these modifications on RCC genes, facilitating the transition from CMs to RCCs. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the feasibility and reveal the mechanisms of pharmacological induction of RCCs from endogenous CMs, which could offer a promising regenerative strategy to repair injured hearts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96841">Endogenous oligomer formation underlies DVL2 condensates and promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway crucially depends on the polymerization of dishevelled 2 (DVL2) into biomolecular condensates. However, given the low affinity of known DVL2 self-interaction sites and its low cellular concentration, it is unclear how polymers can form. Here, we detect oligomeric DVL2 complexes at endogenous protein levels in human cell lines, using a biochemical ultracentrifugation assay. We identify a low-complexity region (LCR4) in the C-terminus whose deletion and fusion decreased and increased the complexes, respectively. Notably, LCR4-induced complexes correlated with the formation of microscopically visible multimeric condensates. Adjacent to LCR4, we mapped a conserved domain (CD2) promoting condensates only. Molecularly, LCR4 and CD2 mediated DVL2 self-interaction via aggregating residues and phenylalanine stickers, respectively. Point mutations inactivating these interaction sites impaired Wnt pathway activation by DVL2. Our study discovers DVL2 complexes with functional importance for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, we provide evidence that DVL2 condensates form in two steps by pre-oligomerization via high-affinity interaction sites, such as LCR4, and subsequent condensation via low-affinity interaction sites, such as CD2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88916">Complex aneuploidy triggers autophagy and p53-mediated apoptosis and impairs the second lineage segregation in human preimplantation embryos</a></h4>

              
                About 70% of human cleavage stage embryos show chromosomal mosaicism, falling to 20% in blastocysts. Chromosomally mosaic human blastocysts can implant and lead to healthy new-borns with normal karyotypes. Studies in mouse embryos and human gastruloids showed that aneuploid cells are eliminated from the epiblast by p53-mediated apoptosis while being tolerated in the trophectoderm. These observations suggest a selective loss of aneuploid cells from human embryos, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the cellular consequences of aneuploidy in a total of 125 human blastocysts. RNA-sequencing of trophectoderm cells showed activated p53 pathway and apoptosis proportionate to the level of chromosomal imbalance. Immunostaining corroborated that aneuploidy triggers proteotoxic stress, autophagy, p53-signaling, and apoptosis independent from DNA damage. Total cell numbers were lower in aneuploid embryos, due to a decline both in trophectoderm and in epiblast/primitive endoderm cell numbers. While lower cell numbers in trophectoderm may be attributed to apoptosis, aneuploidy impaired the second lineage segregation, particularly primitive endoderm formation. This might be reinforced by retention of NANOG. Our findings might explain why fully aneuploid embryos fail to further develop and we hypothesize that the same mechanisms lead to the removal of aneuploid cells from mosaic embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88671">Unified bursting strategies in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns</a></h4>

              
                Transcription often occurs in bursts as gene promoters switch stochastically between active and inactive states. Enhancers can dictate transcriptional activity in animal development through the modulation of burst frequency, duration, or amplitude. Previous studies observed that different enhancers can achieve a wide range of transcriptional outputs through the same strategies of bursting control. For example, in Berrocal et al., 2020, we showed that despite responding to different transcription factors, all <i>even-skipped</i> enhancers increase transcription by upregulating burst frequency and amplitude while burst duration remains largely constant. These shared bursting strategies suggest that a unified molecular mechanism constraints how enhancers modulate transcriptional output. Alternatively, different enhancers could have converged on the same bursting control strategy because of natural selection favoring one of these particular strategies. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we compared transcriptional bursting between endogenous and ectopic gene expression patterns. Because enhancers act under different regulatory inputs in ectopic patterns, dissimilar bursting control strategies between endogenous and ectopic patterns would suggest that enhancers adapted their bursting strategies to their <i>trans</i>-regulatory environment. Here, we generated ectopic <i>even-skipped</i> transcription patterns in fruit fly embryos and discovered that bursting strategies remain consistent in endogenous and ectopic <i>even-skipped</i> expression. These results provide evidence for a unified molecular mechanism shaping <i>even-skipped</i> bursting strategies and serve as a starting point to uncover the realm of strategies employed by other enhancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94296">Decoding contextual influences on auditory perception from primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Perception can be highly dependent on stimulus context, but whether and how sensory areas encode the context remains uncertain. We used an ambiguous auditory stimulus – a tritone pair – to investigate the neural activity associated with a preceding contextual stimulus that strongly influenced the tritone pair’s perception: either as an ascending or a descending step in pitch. We recorded single-unit responses from a population of auditory cortical cells in awake ferrets listening to the tritone pairs preceded by the contextual stimulus. We find that the responses adapt locally to the contextual stimulus, consistent with human MEG recordings from the auditory cortex under the same conditions. Decoding the population responses demonstrates that cells responding to pitch-changes are able to predict well the context-sensitive percept of the tritone pairs. Conversely, decoding the individual pitch representations and taking their distance in the circular Shepard tone space predicts the <i>opposite</i> of the percept. The various percepts can be readily captured and explained by a neural model of cortical activity based on populations of adapting, pitch and pitch-direction cells, aligned with the neurophysiological responses. Together, these decoding and model results suggest that contextual influences on perception may well be already encoded at the level of the primary sensory cortices, reflecting basic neural response properties commonly found in these areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96020">Cross-species alignment along the chronological axis reveals evolutionary effect on structural development of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Disentangling the evolution mysteries of the human brain has always been an imperative endeavor in neuroscience. Although many previous comparative studies revealed genetic, brain structural and connectivity distinctness between human and other nonhuman primates, the brain evolutional mechanism is still largely unclear. Here, we proposed to embed the brain anatomy of human and macaque in the developmental chronological axis to construct cross-species predictive model to quantitatively characterize brain evolution using two large public human and macaque datasets. We observed that applying the trained models within-species could well predict the chronological age. Interestingly, we found the model trained in macaque showed a higher accuracy in predicting the chronological age of human than the model trained in human in predicting the chronological age of macaque. The cross-application of the trained model introduced an individual brain cross-species age gap index to quantify the cross-species discrepancy along the temporal axis of brain development and was found to be associated with the behavioral performance in visual acuity test and picture vocabulary test in human. Taken together, our study situated the cross-species brain development along the chronological axis, which highlighted the disproportionately anatomical development in human brain to extend our understanding of the potential evolutionary effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97085">The identification of extensive samples of motor units in human muscles reveals diverse effects of neuromodulatory inputs on the rate coding</a></h4>

              
                Movements are performed by motoneurons transforming synaptic inputs into an activation signal that controls muscle force. The control signal emerges from interactions between ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons. Critically, these interactions vary across motoneuron pools and differ between muscles. To provide the most comprehensive framework to date of motor unit activity during isometric contractions, we identified the firing activity of extensive samples of motor units in the tibialis anterior (129 ± 44 per participant; n=8) and the vastus lateralis (130 ± 63 per participant; n=8) muscles during isometric contractions of up to 80% of maximal force. From this unique dataset, the rate coding of each motor unit was characterised as the relation between its instantaneous firing rate and the applied force, with the assumption that the linear increase in isometric force reflects a proportional increase in the net synaptic excitatory inputs received by the motoneuron. This relation was characterised with a natural logarithm function that comprised two stages. The initial stage was marked by a steep acceleration of firing rate, which was greater for low- than medium- and high-threshold motor units. The second stage comprised a linear increase in firing rate, which was greater for high- than medium- and low-threshold motor units. Changes in firing rate were largely non-linear during the ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the task, but with significant prolonged firing activity only evident for medium-threshold motor units. Contrary to what is usually assumed, our results demonstrate that the firing rate of each motor unit can follow a large variety of trends with force across the pool. From a neural control perspective, these findings indicate how motor unit pools use gain control to transform inputs with limited bandwidths into an intended muscle force.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80979">Efficient value synthesis in the orbitofrontal cortex explains how loss aversion adapts to the ranges of gain and loss prospects</a></h4>

              
                Is irrational behavior the incidental outcome of biological constraints imposed on neural information processing? In this work, we consider the paradigmatic case of gamble decisions, where gamble values integrate prospective gains and losses. Under the assumption that neurons have a limited firing response range, we show that mitigating the ensuing information loss within artificial neural networks that synthetize value involves a specific form of self-organized plasticity. We demonstrate that the ensuing efficient value synthesis mechanism induces value range adaptation. We also reveal how the ranges of prospective gains and/or losses eventually determine both the behavioral sensitivity to gains and losses and the information content of the network. We test these predictions on two fMRI datasets from the OpenNeuro.org initiative that probe gamble decision-making but differ in terms of the range of gain prospects. First, we show that peoples' loss aversion eventually adapts to the range of gain prospects they are exposed to. Second, we show that the strength with which the orbitofrontal cortex (in particular: Brodmann area 11) encodes gains and expected value also depends upon the range of gain prospects. Third, we show that, when fitted to participant’s gambling choices, self-organizing artificial neural networks generalize across gain range contexts and predict the geometry of information content within the orbitofrontal cortex. Our results demonstrate how self-organizing plasticity aiming at mitigating information loss induced by neurons’ limited response range may result in value range adaptation, eventually yielding irrational behavior.

                Relatively little is known about the way vision is used to guide locomotion in the natural world. What visual features are used to choose paths in natural complex terrain? To answer this question, we measured eye and body movements while participants walked in natural outdoor environments. We incorporated measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) terrain structure into our analyses and reconstructed the terrain along the walker’s path, applying photogrammetry techniques to the eye tracker’s scene camera videos. Combining these reconstructions with the walker’s body movements, we demonstrate that walkers take terrain structure into account when selecting paths through an environment. We find that they change direction to avoid taking steeper steps that involve large height changes, instead of choosing more circuitous, relatively flat paths. Our data suggest walkers plan the location of individual footholds and plan ahead to select flatter paths. These results provide evidence that locomotor behavior in natural environments is controlled by decision mechanisms that account for multiple factors, including sensory and motor information, costs, and path planning.

">Dysregulated calcium signaling in the aged macaque entorhinal cortex associated with tau hyperphosphorylation.</a></h4>

              
                Tau pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows a distinct pattern, beginning in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and spreading to interconnected brain regions. Early-stage tau pathology, characterized by soluble phosphorylated tau, is difficult to study in human brains post-mortem due to rapid dephosphorylation. Rhesus macaques, which naturally develop age-related tau pathology resembling human AD, provide an ideal model for investigating early tau etiology. This study examines the molecular processes underlying tau pathology in the macaque ERC, focusing on calcium and inflammatory signaling pathways. Our findings reveal age-related decreases in PDE4 phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cAMP and increases in calpain-2 and GCPII that occur in parallel with early-stage tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes (pS214-tau, pT181-tau, pT217-tau). These findings suggest that dysregulated calcium signaling in ERC, beginning in middle-age, primes tau for hyperphosphorylation, potentially driving the early stages of AD, advancing our understanding of how ERC vulnerabilities contribute to neurodegeneration in AD.

">Egocentric perception of walking environments using an interactive vision-language system</a></h4>

              
                Large language models can provide a more detailed contextual understanding of a scene beyond what computer vision alone can provide, which have implications for robotics and embodied intelligence. In this study, we developed a novel multimodal vision-language system for egocentric visual perception, with an initial focus on real-world walking environments. We trained a number of state-of-the-art transformer-based vision-language models that use causal language modelling on our custom dataset of 43,055 image-text pairs for few-shot image captioning. We then designed a new speech synthesis model and a user interface to convert the generated image captions into speech for audio feedback to users. Our system also uniquely allows for feedforward user prompts to personalize the generated image captions. Our system is able to generate detailed captions with an average length of 10 words while achieving a high ROUGE-L score of 43.9% and a low word error rate of 28.1% with an end-to-end processing time of 2.2 seconds. Overall, our new multimodal vision-language system can generate accurate and detailed descriptions of natural scenes, which can be further augmented by user prompts. This innovative feature allows our image captions to be personalized to the individual and immediate needs and preferences of the user, thus optimizing the closed-loop interactions between the human and generative AI models for understanding and navigating of real-world environments.

">Divalent siRNA for prion disease</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacologic lowering of PrP expression is efficacious against prion disease in animal models and is now being tested clinically. 50% lowering of PrP increases both survival time and healthy life in prion-infected mice, but does not prevent symptom onset nor halt disease progression. Additional drug candidates should seek to reduce PrP expression to even lower levels. Divalent siRNA is a novel oligonucleotide drug modality with promising potency, durability, and biodistribution data in preclinical models, inspiring us to seek in this technology a new drug candidate for prion disease. Here, we first identify a tool compound against the mouse PrP gene and establish the efficacy of PrP-lowering divalent siRNA in prion-infected mice. We then introduce humanized transgenic mouse lines harboring the full non-coding sequence of the human PrP gene as tools for identifying human sequence-targeted drugs. We identify a highly potent siRNA sequence against the human PrP gene and determine that a chemical scaffold incorporating extended nucleic acid and a 3' antisense tail unmatched to the RNA target yields superior potency. We nominate PrP-lowering divalent siRNA 2439-s4 as a new drug candidate for human prion disease.

">Multi-scale parameterization of neural rhythmicity with lagged Hilbert autocoherence</a></h4>

              
                Analysis of neural activity in different frequency bands is ubiquitous in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Recent analytical breakthroughs and theoretical developments rely on phase maintenance of oscillatory signals without considering whether or not this assumption is met. Lagged (auto)coherence, the coherence between a signal and itself at increasing temporal delays, has been proposed as a way to quantify the rhythmicity, or periodicity, of a signal. However, current Fourier-based lagged autocoherence algorithms suffer from poor spectral accuracy and resolution, aliasing effects that become more pronounced at higher frequencies, and conflation with amplitude covariation, especially in frequency ranges in which the signal power is low. We introduce a continuous lagged autocoherence metric, lagged Hilbert autocoherence, that addresses these shortcomings by using multiplication in the frequency domain for precise bandpass filtering, instantaneous analytic signals via the Hilbert transform, and thresholding using the amplitude covariation of surrogate data generated by an autoregressive model. We show that this version of lagged coherence yields vastly higher spectral accuracy and resolution than lagged Fourier autocoherence, and that this unlocks additional, increasingly fine grained applications. This includes examination of: 1) frequency-specific differences in rhythmicity between conditions, 2) changes in signal rhythmicity during learning, and 3) the relationship between frequency-specific rhythmicity and behavior, trial-by-trial. Lagged Hilbert autocoherence thus offers a significant toolset advancement for analysis of neurophysiological rhythmicity.

">One Hundred Neural Networks and Brains Watching Videos: Lessons from Alignment</a></h4>

              
                What can we learn from comparing video models to human brains, arguably the most efficient and effective video processing systems in existence? Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging (fMRI) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of CNNs and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain.

">Modelling inter-shot variability for robust temporal sub-sampling of dynamic, GABA-edited MR spectroscopy data</a></h4>

              
                Variability between individual transients in an MRS acquisition presents a challenge for reliable quantification, particularly in functional scenarios where discrete subsets of the available transients may be compared. The current study aims to develop and validate a model for removing unwanted variance from GABA-edited MRS data, whilst preserving variance of potential interest - such as metabolic response to a functional task. A linear model is used to describe sources of variance in the system: intrinsic, periodic variance associated with phase cycling and spectral editing, and abrupt changes associated with subject movement. We broadly hypothesize that modelling these factors appropriately will improve spectral quality and reduce variance in quantification outcomes, without introducing bias to the estimates. We additionally anticipate that the models will improve (or at least maintain) sensitivity to functional changes, outperforming established methods in this regard. In vivo GABA-edited MRS data (203 subjects from the publicly available Big GABA collection) were sub-sampled strategically to assess individual components of the model, benchmarked against the uncorrected case and against established approaches such as spectral improvement by Fourier thresholding (SIFT). Changes in metabolite concentration and lineshape simulating response to a functional task were synthesized, and sensitivity to such changes was assessed. Composite models yielded improved SNR and reduced variability of GABA+ estimates compared to the uncorrected case in all scenarios, with performance for individual model components varying. Similarly, while some model components in isolation led to increased variability in estimates, no bias was observed in these or in the composite models. While SIFT yielded the greatest reductions in unwanted variance, the resultant data were substantially less sensitive to synthetic functional changes. We conclude that the modelling presented is effective at reducing unwanted variance, whilst retaining temporal dynamics of interest for functional MRS applications, and recommend its inclusion in fMRS processing pipelines.

">Transcriptomic changes in retinal ganglion cell types associated with the disruption of cholinergic retinal waves</a></h4>

              
                In the early stages of retinal development, a form of correlated activity known as retinal waves causes periodic depolarizations of immature retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Retinal waves are crucial for refining visual maps in the brain's retinofugal targets and for the development of retinal circuits underlying feature detection, such as direction selectivity. Yet, how waves alter gene expression in immature RGCs is poorly understood, particularly at the level of the many distinct types of RGCs that underlie the retinas ability to encode diverse visual features. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on RGCs isolated at the end of the first postnatal week from wild-type (WT) mice and {beta}2KO mice, which lack the {beta}2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to the disruption of cholinergic retinal waves. Statistical comparisons of RGC transcriptomes between the two conditions reveal a weak impact of retinal waves on RGC diversity, indicating that retinal waves do not influence the molecular programs that instruct RGC differentiation and maturation. Although wave-dependent gene expression changes are modest in the global sense, we identified ~238 genes that are significantly altered in select subsets of RGC types. We focused on one gene, Kcnk9, which encodes the two-pore domain leak channel potassium channel TASK3. Kcnk9, which is highly enriched in RGCs, was strongly downregulated in {beta}2KO. We validated this result using in situ hybridization and performed whole-cell recording to demonstrate a significant decrease in the leak conductance in {beta}2KO RGCs. Our dataset provides a useful resource for identifying potential targets of spontaneous activity-dependent regulation of neurodevelopment in the retina.

">EEG data quality in large scale field studies in India and Tanzania</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing imperative to understand the neurophysiological impact of our rapidly changing and diverse technological, social, chemical, and physical environments. To untangle the multidimensional and interacting effects requires data at scale across diverse populations, taking measurement out of a controlled lab environment and into the field. Electroencephalography (EEG), which has correlates with various environmental factors as well as cognitive and mental health outcomes, has the advantage of both portability and cost-effectiveness for this purpose. However, with numerous field researchers spread across diverse locations, data quality issues and researcher idle time due to insufficient participants can quickly become unmanageable and expensive problems. In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, non-specialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30-week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 subjects per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 2,400 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per subject of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

">Brain responses vary in duration - modelingstrategies and challenges</a></h4>

              
                Typically, event-related brain responses are calculated invariant to the underlying event duration, even in cases where event durations observably vary: with reaction times, fixation durations, word lengths, or varying stimulus durations. Additionally, an often co-occurring consequence of differing event durations is a variable overlap of the responses to subsequent events. While the problem of overlap e.g. in fMRI and EEG is successfully addressed using linear deconvolution, it is unclear whether deconvolution and duration covariate modeling can be jointly used, as both are dependent on the same inter-event-distance variability. Here, we first show that failing to explicitly account for event durations can lead to spurious results and thus are important to consider. Next, we propose and compare several methods based on multiple regression to explicitly account for stimulus durations. Using simulations, we find that non-linear spline regression of the duration effect outperforms other candidate approaches. Finally, we show that non-linear event duration modeling is compatible with linear overlap correction in time, making it a flexible and appropriate tool to model overlapping brain signals. This allows us to reconcile the analysis of stimulus responses with e.g. condition-biased reaction times, condition-biased stimulus duration, or fixation-related activity with condition-biased fixation durations. While in this paper we focus on EEG analyses, these findings generalize to LFPs, fMRI BOLD-responses, pupil dilation responses, and other overlapping signals.

">Trial-by-trial inter-areal interactions in visual cortex in the presence or absence of visual stimulation</a></h4>

              
                State-of-the-art computational models of vision largely focus on fitting trial-averaged spike counts to visual stimuli using overparameterized neural networks. However, a computational model of the visual cortex should predict the dynamic responses of neurons in single trials across different experimental conditions. In this study, we investigated trial-by-trial inter-areal interactions in the visual cortex by predicting neuronal activity in one area based on activity in another, distinguishing between stimulus-driven and non-stimulus-driven shared variability. We analyzed two datasets: calcium imaging from mouse V1 layers 2/3 and 4, and extracellular neurophysiological recordings from macaque V1 and V4. Our results show that neuronal activity can be predicted bidirectionally between L2/3 and L4 in mice, and between V1 and V4 in macaques, with the latter interaction exhibiting directional asymmetry. The predictability of neuronal responses varied with the type of visual stimulus, yet responses could also be predicted in the absence of visual stimulation. In mice, we observed a bimodal distribution of neurons, with some neurons primarily driven by visual inputs and others showing predictable activity during spontaneous activity despite lacking consistent visually evoked responses. Predictability also depended on intrinsic neuronal properties, receptive field overlap, and the relative timing of activity across areas. Our findings highlight the presence of both stimulus- and non-stimulus-related components in interactions between visual areas across diverse contexts and underscore the importance of non-visual shared variability between visual regions in both mice and macaques.

">A subset of mouse hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons learns sparse synaptic input patterns.</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is fundamental to learning and memory, yet few studies examine how pattern learning occurs across multiple synapses. Such cross-synapse learning is fundamental to emergent properties of pattern discrimination and generalisation, which depend on assumptions about independence of plasticity and linearity of summation. We used sparse optogenetic spatiotemporal pattern stimulation in the CA3 coupled with postsynaptic depolarization to elicit plasticity on CA1 pyramidal neurons, and found that 'trained' patterns were selectively strengthened, but only in a subset of postsynaptic cells. Increased resting membrane potential and background mini-EPSP rates were predictive of learner cells. Summation following plasticity became more linear in learners compared to non-learners, consistent with the observed elevated post-stimulus hyperpolarization on non-learner cells. Thus our exploration of biologically plausible sparse activity supports pattern-selective learning, but in a heterogeneous manner modulated by both cell-intrinsic and network features.

">A Comparative Study of Muscular, Vestibular, and Haptic Stimulation on Dream Incorporation</a></h4>

              
                The connection between the dreamed body and the real physical body remains a subject of ongoing investigation. This study explored how the dreamed body responds to somatosensory stimulation of the physical body, aiming to shed light on the sensory processes that shape our dreaming experiences. We employed a novel within-subject design to compare the incorporation of three different types of bodily stimuli; electrical muscular, galvanic vestibular, and haptic vibration, into dream content, alongside a control sham condition for each stimulus. In total, 24 participants spent one adaptation night, followed by three consecutive test nights in the sleep laboratory. REM awakenings, after sham or stimulation periods, were carried out for dream report collection. In total, 165 dream reports were collected across conditions. While dream incorporation was observed across the three stimulation methods, it occurred equally in both the stimulation and sham conditions for all three modalities. These findings highlight broader methodological challenges in dream incorporation research and raise concerns about potential confounding factors affecting the interpretation of results. Future research with larger sample sizes is needed to detect smaller effect sizes and fully understand the influence of these somatosensory stimuli on dream content. This study employed a rigorous experimental approach to exploring dream incorporation and addressed many methodological challenges in this area. We further suggest areas of improvement to optimize dream incorporation of different sensory modalities.

">Cognitive Dynamics of Verb-Particle Constructions: An Eye-Tracking Study</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the cognitive processing of verb-particle constructions (VPCs) using eye-tracking data analysis method to explore how English native speakers process different types of the sequence NP-verb-particle-NP during reading tasks. While previous research has focused on phrasal verbs, our study extends this examination to include patterns with prepositions, aiming to identify distinct cognitive engagement patterns and processing efficiencies associated with each. We employed the Provo Corpus to analyse eye movements while participants read sentences containing these constructions. we focused on metrics such as first fixation duration, gaze duration, go-past times, and total reading times. Our findings indicate similarities in the lexical verbs, and significant differences in particles, indicating how these two types of constructions are processed, with phrasal verbs sometimes processed more efficiently than the prepositional counterparts. This suggests that phrasal verbs might be more deeply entrenched in the linguistic repertoire of native speakers, possibly functioning as single lexical units. This research contributes to the understanding of complex structures processing and the cognitive mechanisms that support it, offering insights that could influence linguistic theory and language education.

">Time-of-day related fluctuations of self-belief formation</a></h4>

              
                Time of day influences a variety of human cognitive processes, including attention, executive functions and memory formation, as well as affective experiences and mood. However, circadian modulations of self-related learning and belief formation, which are highly affected by emotional states, remain poorly understood. Here, we present results from exploratory post-hoc analyses on data aggregated from five studies assessing the formation of self-related ability beliefs. A total of N=242 healthy participants completed a validated learning task at different times of the day, during which they continuously received feedback on their performance. Computational modeling was applied to quantify participants' learning behavior during the task. Results suggest an association between time-of-day and self-belief formation, showing that participants who were tested in the evening (7:00-9:59 p.m.) updated their self-beliefs more strongly in response to the received feedback compared to those tested in the afternoon (1:00-3:59 p.m.). Evidence from additional models indicated that these differences were driven by non-linear, rhythmic changes in self-belief formation across different times of the day. Future studies should systematically examine within-subject fluctuations in self-belief formation across the day and address the influence of individual factors such as chronotype, age, mood and sleep quality. Understanding circadian modulations of self-related belief formation could contribute to optimized interventions for conditions characterized by maladaptive self-beliefs, such as depression, as well as in academic contexts.

">Effects of Spatial Constraints of Inhibitory Connectivity on the Dynamical Development of Criticality in Spiking Networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural systems are hypothesized to operate near criticality, enhancing their capacity for optimal information processing, transmission and storage capabilities. Criticality has typically been studied in spiking neural networks and related systems organized in random or full connectivity, with the balance of excitation and inhibition being a key determinant of the critical point of the system. However, given that neurons in the brain are spatially distributed, with their distances significantly influencing connectivity and signal timing, it is unclear how the spatial organization of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity influences the network's self-organization towards criticality. Here, we systematically constrain the distance and density of inhibitory connectivity in two-dimensional spiking networks and allow synaptic weights to self-organize with activity-dependent excitatory and inhibitory plasticity in the presence of a low level of stochastic intrinsic activity. We then investigate the relationship between inhibitory connectivity, synaptic weights, and the resulting network activity during and after development. We find that networks with longer-range inhibitory synapses tend towards more supercritical behavior compared to networks with a similar number of shorter-range inhibitory synapses. We show that this distance dependence is a consequence of weaker long-range synapses after development due to the presence of synaptic delays, which shift most spike pairs outside of the potentiation window of the inhibitory learning rule.

">Caliber of sensory axons in vivo varies spatially and temporally and is influenced by the cellular microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Cell shape is crucial to cell function, particularly in neurons. The cross-sectional diameter, also known as caliber, of axons and dendrites is an important parameter of neuron shape, best appreciated for its influence on the speed of action potential propagation. Most studies of axon caliber focus on cell-wide regulation and assume that caliber is static. Here, we have investigated local variation and dynamics of axon caliber in the peripheral axons of zebrafish touch-sensing neurons at embryonic stages, prior to sex determination. To obtain absolute measurements of caliber in vivo, we paired sparse membrane labeling with super-resolution microscopy of neurons in live fish. We found that axon segments had varicose or "pearled" morphologies, and thus vary in caliber along their length, consistent with reports from mammalian systems. Sister axon segments originating from the most proximal branch point in the axon arbor had average calibers that were largely independent of each other. Axon caliber tapered across the branch point, suggesting that action potential conductance may be favored in these afferent axons. Caliber was dynamic on the time-scale of minutes, and this dynamicity changed over the course of development. By measuring the caliber of axons adjacent to dividing epithelial cells, we found that the cellular microenvironment is one of potentially multiple drivers of axon caliber variation across space and time. Our findings raise the possibility that spatial and temporal variation in axon caliber could significantly influence neuronal physiology.

">Top-down attention and Alzheimer's pathology impact cortical selectivity during learning,influencing episodic memory in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Human aging affects the ability to remember new experiences, in part, because of altered neural function during memory formation. One potential contributor to age-related memory decline is diminished neural selectivity -- i.e., a decline in the differential response of cortical regions to preferred vs. non-preferred stimuli during event perception -- yet the factors driving variability in neural selectivity with age remain unclear. We examined the impact of top-down attention and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on neural selectivity during memory encoding in 156 cognitively unimpaired older participants who underwent fMRI while performing a word-face and word-scene associative memory task. Neural selectivity in face- and place-selective cortical regions was greater during events that were later remembered compared to forgotten. Critically, neural selectivity during learning positively scaled with memory-related variability in top-down attention, whereas selectivity negatively related to early AD pathology, evidenced by elevated plasma pTau181. Path analysis revealed that neural selectivity at encoding mediated the effects of age, top-down attention, and pTau181 on associative memory. Collectively, these data reveal multiple pathways that contribute to memory differences among older adults -- AD-independent reductions in top-down attention and AD-related pathology alter the precision of cortical representations of events during experience, with consequences for remembering.

">FTO (fat-mass and obesity-associated protein) deficiency aggravates age-dependent depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Background: The demethylase fat mass and obesity-related protein (FTO) is strongly associated with depression. Aging is a risk factor for synaptic plasticity damage in the brain and leads to neurocognitive dysfunctions. However, whether FTO is associated with susceptibility to depression in different age groups remains unknown. Methods: We subjected 3- and 12-month-old C57BL/6J male mice to 6 weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and 3 weeks of hippocampal injection of FTO knockdown adeno-associated virus 9 shRNA (FTO-KD AAV9). Finally, 36 male mice in each 3-month-old and 12-month-old groups were divided into three groups (n=12): Sham, CUMS, and FTO-KD. After 6 weeks, we assessed behavioral deficits (depressive and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment) by behavioral tests and hippocampal neuronal damage (dendritic spine density, neuronal atrophy, and expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity) by molecular biochemical experiments. Results: The results showed that 12-month-old C57BL/6J mice were more likely to develop depression-like behavior and spatial learning and memory impairment induced by CUMS than 3-month-old mice. Chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior and cognitive impairment worsened after the FTO-KD intervention. In the hippocampus of 3- and 12-month-old mice, CUMS induced the downregulation of FTO, nerve growth factor (NGF), reelin, and synaptic plasticity-related proteins. It also caused abnormal BDNF-TrkB signaling, reduced density of dendritic spines, and an increased number of neuronal pyknotic nuclei, leading to neuronal disarray, which was more significant in 12-month-old animals. FTO deficiency accelerated neuronal damage in the hippocampus of 12-month-old CUMS mice. Conclusions: This study provides rodent evidence that FTO deficiency may increase the susceptibility to depression in older adults by impairing hippocampal neuronal function and neuronal synaptic plasticity in an age-dependent manner. This suggests that the development of FTO activators may be an effective treatment for depression in older adults.

">Lymphatic drainage of cerebrospinal fluid using lymph node seeker 64Cu-labeled Gram-negative bacterial extracellular vesicles PET</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is drained into the systemic lymphatics via paravertebral lymph nodes. Superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes collect CSF in mice, but the exact and quantified routes are unknown. Recently, we simultaneously visualized cervical, sacral and iliac lymph nodes via serial imaging on the intrathecal [64Cu]Cu-albumin positron emission tomography. Paravertebral lymph nodes might act as sentinels to monitor the CSF, brain, and spinal cord. We used 64Cu-labeled Escherichia coli extracellular vesicles, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), as lymph node seekers for intrathecal administration with an optimized volume/rate and quantified the differential amounts of various paravertebral lymph nodes along the axis of the brain and spinal cord in mice. The quantified results revealed 77.3% in superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes, 11.4% in abdominal/pelvic lymph nodes and 11.3% in sacral lymph nodes. Click-labeled [64Cu]Cu-OMVs were drained to reach and stop at the lymph nodes on serial quantification. The cervical lymph nodes drained most of the OMV-laden CSF, which is proportional to the surface areas of the brain (70%) and spinal cord in mice. We propose that all paravertebral lymph nodes monitor the segmental regions of the brain and spinal cord as immediate sentinel lymph nodes against the central nervous system.

">Parkinson's disease-associated Pink1 loss disrupts vesicle trafficking in ensheathing glia causing dopaminergic neuron synapse loss</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, but many other cell types are affected even before neuron loss occurs. Recent studies have linked oligodendrocytes to early stages of PD, though their precise role is still unclear. Pink1 is mutated in familial PD and through unbiased single-cell sequencing of the entire brain of Drosophila Pink1 models, we observed significant gene deregulation in ensheathing glia (EG); cells that share functional similarities with oligodendrocytes. We found that the loss of Pink1 leads to the activation of EG, similar to the reactive response of EG seen upon nerve injury. Using cell-type specific transcriptomics, we identified deregulated genes in EG as potential functional modifiers. Specifically, downregulating two trafficking factors, Rab7 and Vps13, also mutated in PD, or the direct regulators of Rab7, Mon1 and Ccz1, specifically in EG was sufficient to rescue neuronal function and protect against dopaminergic synapse loss. Our findings demonstrate that Pink1 loss in neurons triggers an injury response in EG, and that Pink1 loss in EG in turn disrupts neuronal function. Vesicle trafficking components, which regulate membrane interactions between organelles within EG, play a crucial role in maintaining neuronal health and preventing dopaminergic synapse loss. Our work highlights the essential role of glial support cells in the pathogenesis of PD and identifies vesicle trafficking within these cells as a key point of convergence in disease progression.

">Behavior-relevant periodized neural representation of acoustic but not tactile rhythm in humans</a></h4>

              
                Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with the rhythm of music requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve a selective enhancement of the beat periodicities in the neural response to rhythm. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat, and the related periodized neural representation, are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using acoustic and tactile rhythms, while recording separately the electroencephalography (EEG) responses and finger tapping to these rhythms in healthy volunteers. Consistent with previous studies, EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm featured significant enhancement of the beat, and this periodized neural representation was specifically concentrated within a low-frequency range below 15 Hz. In contrast, the same rhythm conveyed with tactile inputs elicited responses over a broader frequency range, up to 25Hz, with no significant periodization, and resulted in less stable tapping. Together, these findings indicate that low-frequency neural activity preferentially supports behavior-relevant internal representation of rhythmic input. However, this neural representation is not necessarily shared across the senses, as well as the ability to move to the beat, corroborating multimodal differences in beat perception. This low-frequency neural representation may thus reflect a process of multiscale temporal integration allowing the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.

">Repetition of Rhythmic Patterns Fosters Neural Representation of Musical Meter</a></h4>

              
                Music often entails perception of periodic pulses (hereafter meter) which serve as an internal temporal reference to coordinate movements to music. Crucially, meter perception arises even when the musical rhythm only weakly cues meter periodicities (i.e., syncopated rhythms). However, syncopated rhythms are often looped in music, suggesting that repetition of rhythmic patterns may facilitate meter perception by providing periodic cues at a slower, supra-second timescale. Here, we tested this hypothesis by recording separately electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral responses (finger tapping) while participants listened to different syncopated rhythmic sequences. These sequences either consisted of a repeated pattern (repetition of 4.8 and 9.6-s patterns) or were generated without repetition. EEG responses showed overall periodization of the rhythmic input, at periodicities corresponding to those expressed as the meter in behavioral responses, and in contrast with the weak cues to these periodicities in the rhythmic inputs. Most importantly, pattern repetition strengthened this neural representation of the meter, demonstrating that supra-second periodicities in the rhythmic input further enhance sub-second periodicities in neural activity. These findings thus highlight the multiscale nature of temporal processes at stake in processing musical rhythm, and, more generally, complex rhythmic inputs involved in interpersonal interaction and communication.

">Meta-prediction extends human cortical and subcortical reward learning</a></h4>

              
                Human reward learning is constrained by environmental structure. Stable environments facilitate reward prediction but limit learning experiences[1-8], while uncertain environments hinder predictability and learnability[9-12]. We propose a novel framework extending these boundaries through "meta-prediction" - predicting human prediction. The meta-prediction entwines two Bellman equations: one for human prediction and the other for predicting the prediction error of the former. The framework pretrains computational models imitating individuals' reward prediction (specification), then generates new tasks to extremize the models' prediction errors (generalization). Simulations with 82 subjects' data generated subject-independent task design across four scenarios without compromising learnability. In an independent fMRI experiment with 49 participants, meta-prediction guides behavior and neural activities in the ventral striatum, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortex, the areas encoding prediction errors. We also demonstrated that meta-prediction can generate complex tasks compositionally to discern human reward learning bias. Our framework redefines the role of tasks in cognitive science and AI.

">The neuroreceptors and transporters underlying spontaneous brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the neuromodulators driving brain activity is critical for understanding communication, cognition, and neuropathology. Neuromodulators act through neuroreceptors and transporters and crucially, operate in a coordinated manner. However, in vivo methods in humans that can identify the neuromodulators driving brain activity remain limited. Here, we address this limitation using a neuroreceptor-based framework, enabling the identification of neuroreceptors and transporters underlying spontaneous brain activity. The framework utilizes cortical density maps of 19 neuroreceptors and transporters derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Across four datasets (Ntotal = 314), our framework reconstructs spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity (FC) from BOLD signals measured by functional MRI (fMRI), achieving an average accuracy of RBOLD = 0.58 +/- 0.05 and RFC = 0.62 +/- 0.02. Notably, our analysis reveals that the excitation-inhibition balance is maintained by two distinct modules of neuroreceptors and transporters exhibiting regional density differences across the cortex. The frameworks validity is supported by its ability to recover neuroreceptors and transporter's, 5-HT1a, 5-HT1b, 5-HT2a, and D2, known to bind lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and D2, 5-HT1a, 5-HT2a, and NET mediating the effects of Modafinil. Furthermore, the framework identified mechanistic links between neuroreceptors, transporters, and altered brain activity in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. Finally, neuroreceptor-based reconstruction outperformed models based on structural connectivity and cortical folding geometry. Together, these findings underscore the potential of this neuroreceptor-based framework to advance our understanding of neuromodulatory mechanisms across diverse brain states and conditions.

	<p>Introduction: Randomized clinical trials should be complemented with data from real-world studies. We report our long-term experience with safinamide in a movement disorders unit. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) treated with safinamide in our unit from February 2016 to May 2022 under routine clinical practice. Assessments included the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III score, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD for dopamine agonists, and safinamide treatment discontinuation. Results: We included 180 patients with a median age of 74 years (IQR 11), and the majority (90.6%) had an HY stage of &amp;amp;le;2. After a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR 34), 14 patients discontinued treatment with safinamide (7.8%, 95% CI 4.7 to 12.6). Among the 166 patients who remained on safinamide, the UPDRS III score was stable (10 (IQR 9) vs. 9 (IQR 13), p = 0.455). The LEDD significantly increased from a median of 300 mg to 500 mg (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), whereas the LEDD for dopamine agonists did not significantly increase. A subgroup of 89 patients who did not require dopamine agonists during follow-up showed stable UPDRS III score (10 (IQR 7) vs. 9 (IQR 14); p = 0.923), with a significant LEDD increase (300 mg to 400 mg, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Our results support the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of safinamide in patients with PD in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Objective: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising complementary treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, its efficacy varies due to diverse participant profiles and methodologies. This meta-analysis, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023457269), seeks to assess NIBS efficacy in improving cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms in individuals with ADHD. Methods: We systematically searched five databases (October 2024) for randomized controlled trials focusing on cognitive functions and clinical symptoms in individuals meeting the DSM/ICD criteria for ADHD. A meta-analytical synthesis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1. Results: Meta-analyses found significant improvement in inhibitory control, working memory, and inattention in active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) groups compared with sham groups. Conversely, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) did not demonstrate significant therapeutic benefits for ADHD symptoms. Additionally, four transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) and three transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) studies demonstrated promising improvements in executive functions and the alleviation of ADHD symptoms. Conclusions: The findings from this meta-analysis highlight NIBS as a promising adjunctive therapy for managing ADHD, advancing both theoretical knowledge and practical treatment options in this field.</p>

	<p>Background: The female orgasm is a highly understudied phenomenon that is linked to both wellbeing and relationship satisfaction in women. Although orgasm has been associated with interoception&amp;amp;mdash;the sense of the physiological condition of the body&amp;amp;mdash;very few studies have directly examined the influence that interoception has on orgasm. Objectives: This study investigates how the subjective experience of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s interoceptive capacities (called interoceptive awareness) is associated with self-reported orgasm frequency and satisfaction in people who identify as women. Methods: In a dataset of 318 women, orgasm frequency and satisfaction were both rated significantly higher for solitary as compared to partnered sexual experiences. Results: Analysis of how dimensions of interoceptive awareness correlated with orgasm frequency and satisfaction showed that (1) &amp;amp;lsquo;Noticing&amp;amp;rsquo; predicted orgasm frequency (but not satisfaction) across both solitary and partnered interactions, (2) &amp;amp;lsquo;Attention Regulation&amp;amp;rsquo; predicted greater frequency and satisfaction of solitary orgasm (but not partnered interactions), and (3) &amp;amp;lsquo;Body Trusting&amp;amp;rsquo; predicted orgasm satisfaction (but not frequency) across both solitary and partnered contexts. Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of moving beyond orgasmic dysfunction research by investigating how interoception is associated with healthy&amp;amp;mdash;and potentially even optimal&amp;amp;mdash;orgasmic functioning in women.</p>

">Using FoxP2 to Distinguish Direct and Indirect Basal Ganglia Pathways for Vocal Learning in Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning in songbirds provides a powerful experimental model for motor skill learning. The cortico-basal ganglia pathways that mediate vocal learning in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are localized in two parallel circuits. These circuits traverse a cortical region (LMAN), a specialized region of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning (Area X), and a region of dorsomedial thalamus (DLM). Area X, which contains both striatal and pallidal neurons, includes functional analogs of mammalian direct and indirect pathways that may have opposing effects and thereby increase or inhibit thalamic activity respectively. Direct pallidal neurons of Area X send inhibitory projections to DLM, whereas indirect pallidal neurons form intrinsic connections onto DLM-projecting neurons. We used tract-tracing techniques to label direct pallidal Area X[-&gt;]DLM projection neurons and immunohistochemical techniques to label neurons expressing the transcription factor FoxP2 in adult and juvenile male zebra finches. Our results showed that DLM-projecting neurons in Area X did not express FoxP2 in either adults or juveniles. We also observed a population of large neurons that expressed FoxP2 but were not retrogradely-labeled from DLM. A marker of striatal neurons (DARPP-32) did not co-localize with FoxP2 in most of these large neurons, providing evidence that they may form a class of putative indirect pallidal neurons. Our findings offer FoxP2 as a possible marker for indirect pallidal neurons and support the existence of different subpopulations of neurons that likely correspond to direct and indirect pathways within Area X.

">Parallel and converging multisensory cascades in the Drosophila connectome</a></h4>

              
                Connectomes are network maps of synaptic connectivity. A key functional role of any connectome is to constrain inter-neuronal signaling and to sculpt the flow of activity patterns across the nervous system. Connectomes therefore play a central role in the rapid tranmission of information about an organism's environment from sensory neurons to higher-order neurons for action planning and ultimately to effectors. Here, we use an abstract model of activity spread to investigate the connectome's role in shaping sensory cascades. Our model allows us to simulate the signaling pathways from sensors to the rest of brain, mapping the similarity of these pathways between different sensory modalities and identifying convergence zones--neurons that are activated simultaneously by different sensory modalities. Further, we considered two multisensory integration scenarios -- a cooperative case where different sensory modalities interacted to "speed up" (reduce) neurons' activation times and a competitive "winner take all" case, where different sensory streams vied for the same neural territory. Finally, we use a data-driven algorithm to partition neurons into different classes based on their behavior during the cascade simulations. Our work helps underscore the role of "simple" models for enriching connectome data, while offering a data-driven classification of neurons based on their joint connectional/dynamical properties.

">Biological Database Mining for LLM-Driven Alzheimer's Disease Drug Repurposing</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: The synergy of structured knowledge and large language models (LLMs) may contribute to identifying drugs for Alzheimer disease (AD) drug repurposing (DR). This paper developed a software pipeline that uses LLMs to translate knowledge stored in natural language (such as in scientific texts) to an applicable DR information structure. METHODS: AD-related entries in Gene Ontology and DrugBank were integrated into a Knowledge Graph database to inform LLM prompts. Based on the biological process impact, the LLM provided a suitability rating for DR, taking into account the inhibitory effect of drugs on AD driving processes.. RESULTS: Drugs with a high potential for DR were identified and manually reviewed, also considering adverse effects. Ripretinib and Pertuzumab (both kinase inhibitors) had the highest DR applicable rating across all iterations. DISCUSSION: We propose retrospective analyses, considering the high-rated drugs and their effect on AD patients as a starting point for further (prospective) research.

">Lifespan trajectory of chimpanzee brains characterized by magnetic resonance imaging histology</a></h4>

              
                Chimpanzee brain maturation provides an invaluable framework for understanding the evolution of the human brain. We performed ultra-high resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) with histological validation on post mortem brains from captive and wild chimpanzees with a broad age range. We mapped developmental myelination and age-related iron accumulation across regions and layers of the neocortex. Compared to humans, chimpanzees showed more myelination and iron deposition in motor and premotor cortices, while the auditory cortex was more strongly myelinated in humans. Our model suggests that chimpanzees' cortical myelination was largely completed by the age of nine years, while iron accumulation continued throughout the lifespan. The regions with highest adult levels of myelin and iron took the longest to mature, challenging the widespread assumption that highly myelinated regions complete their development first. The reported maps and developmental curves provide a foundation for comparative neuroscience research and understanding of human brain evolution.

">HCN1 channels in GABAergic amygdalar neurons underpin male-biased aggressive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Aggression behaviors typically vary between sexes, but the molecular mechanisms driving these disparities in neural coding are unclear. We found that aggression selectively activates GABAergic neurons in the posterior substantia innominata (pSI), an extend amygdala region critical for aggressive behaviors in both sexes of mice, with males exhibiting higher neuronal activity during the attack. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the diverse molecular landscape of pSI neurons, revealing significant differences in ion channels and hormone regulator genes that may underpin sex-specific aggression. Male GABAergic pSI neurons exhibited remarkable hyperexcitability due to increased Ih currents. Strikingly, modulating HCN1 expression not only adjusted this hyperexcitability but also influenced sexual dimorphism in aggression: silencing HCN1 in the GABAergic pSI neurons reduced male aggression, while its overexpression markedly heightened aggression in females. Furthermore, testosterone was shown to intensify aggression by upregulating HCN1 and remodeling pSI circuits. These findings provide detailed sex-specific molecular mechanisms underlying social behaviors.

                Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons are classically linked to Pavlovian reward learning and reinforcement. Intermingled VTA GABA neurons are positioned to regulate dopaminergic and striatal systems, but we lack critical insight into how this population contributes to conditioned motivation in different learning contexts. Recording DA and GABA neurons across multiple conditioning paradigms, we found that GABA neurons not only actively encode appetitive and aversive cues and outcomes separately, but uniquely integrate salient events of both valences to guide reward seeking.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This systematic review of neuropsychological rehabilitation strategies for primary progressive aphasia will consider recent developments in cognitive neuroscience, especially neuroimaging techniques such as EEG and fMRI, to outline how these tools might be integrated into clinical practice to maximize treatment outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature from the last decade was performed following the PRISMA guidelines across multiple databases. A total of 63 studies were included, guided by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a focus on cognitive and language rehabilitation in PPA, interventions guided by neuroimaging, and mechanisms of neuroplasticity. Results: Integration of neuroimaging techniques contributes to the increase in the efficacy of interventions with critical information about the neural mechanisms underlying language deficits in the aphasias. Traditional rehabilitation strategies, technology-assisted interventions, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques hold considerable promise for language improvement. Neuroimaging was also found to be necessary in subtype-specific differentiation toward tailoring therapeutic intervention. Evidence also shows that directed and sustained interventions using neuroplasticity can have long-term effects in managing the symptoms of PPA. Conclusions: The present review underlines the necessity of including cognitive neuroscience techniques within neuropsychological rehabilitation to enhance therapeutic outcomes in PPA. In addition, neuroimaging modalities such as EEG and fMRI are also of great importance in understanding the underlying neurobiology of language disturbances and guiding tailored interventions. Long-term benefits of these approaches should be evaluated, including their applicability in routine clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to the well-recognized motor disturbances, by a complex interplay between cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. We dissect the complex landscape of PD-related psychiatric symptoms, taking into account the impact of functional neurological disorders, somatic delusions, impulse control disorders, and conditions within the bipolar spectrum. The newer entities of somatoform and functional neurological disorders, as well as preexisting bipolar spectrum disorders, are analyzed in detail. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of PD, wherein the cognitive and psychiatric dimensions are valued alongside motor symptoms. Such an approach aims to facilitate early detection and personalized interventions, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT) has long been involved in response to stress and its effect may be, in part, mediated by 5-HT1a and 5-HT7 receptor subtypes in different brain structures. Both pre- and post-synaptic activation of 5-HT1a receptor, respectively, in the rat median raphe nucleus (MnRN) and hippocampus, lead to adaptation to acute inescapable stressors such as restraint and forced swim. 5-HT7 receptor (5HT7r), a stimulatory G-protein coupled receptor, has also been investigated as a possible candidate for mediating stress response. In the MnRN, activation of 5-HT7r has antidepressant effects, while in the hippocampus, 5HT7r mRNA expression is increased after exposure to restraint stress, but the functional significance of these receptors remains to be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether blockade of hippocampal 5HT7r would prevent and/or attenuate the behavioral effects of stress. Male adult Wistar rats with bilateral cannulas aimed at the dorsal hippocampus were restrained for 2 h and tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) 24 h later. SB 258741 (3 nmoles/0.5 μL/side; selective 5HT7r antagonist) was administered bilateraly into the hippocampus according to the experimental protocol: immediately before or after stress, or 24 h after it (immediately before the test). In a second experiment, rats were exposed to 15 min. of forced swim, and tested 24 h later. Intra-hippocampal treatment was performed as described for the restraint stress protocol. We found that blockade of hippocampal 5-HT7r immediately after, but not before, the exposure to restraint or forced swim attenuated stress-induced behavioral changes. Similar results were obtained when SB was administered before the test in previously stressed rats. Our data suggest that activation of hippocampal 5-HT7r is crucial for the consolidation and retrieval of aversive stimulus-related memories, such as those caused by a stressful experience, probably through mechanisms involving stress-induced changes in 5-HT7r expression.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During the 1980s and 1990s, much memory research focused on the differential role of the hippocampus in various forms of memory. My work on the distinction between explicit and implicit memory led me to become involved in several early neuroimaging studies that made use of cognitive paradigms to investigate the conditions in which hippocampal activity does and does not occur, and to address the theoretical implications of these findings. Here, I summarize two such projects and some of the personal backstory associated with them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27149?af=R">Inhibition of Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Prevents Tau Pathology in iPSC Derived Neurons and PS19 Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic feature involving the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain (tauopathies). This suggests that there may be some shared pathophysiologic mechanism(s). The largest risk factor for the majority of these disorders is aging, suggesting involvement of the aging process in the shared pathophysiology. We test the hypothesis that an increase in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that occurs during aging contributes to the onset and progression of tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were used to investigate the effects of BMP signaling on tau phosphorylation and release and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Wildtype mice were used to examine effects of BMP signaling <i>in vivo</i>. P301S (PS19) mice were examined for the effects of BMP signaling in a model of tauopathy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we show that BMP signaling, mediated by non-canonical p38 signaling, increases tau phosphorylation and release of p-tau in human iPSC-derived AD neurons. Further, there is an interaction between BMP signaling and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) that significantly increases tau phosphorylation and release compared with ApoE3 neurons. Inhibiting BMP signaling reduces the changes in tau in the cultured human neurons, and it limits tau pathology and prevents cognitive decline in PS19 mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that the age-related increase in BMP signaling may participate in the onset and progression of tau pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions that reduce BMP signaling in the aging brain could potentially slow or prevent development of diseases involving tau hyperphosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27150?af=R">Prophylactic Fetal Creatine Supplementation Improves Post‐Asphyxial EEG Recovery and Reduces Seizures in Fetal Sheep: Implications for Hypoxic–Ischemic Encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days’ gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>In glioma surgery, maximizing the extent of resection while preserving cognitive functions requires an understanding of the unique architecture of the white matter (WM) pathways of the single patient and of their spatial relationship with the tumor. Tractography enables the reconstruction of WM pathways, and bundle segmentation allows the identification of critical connections for functional preservation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a streamline-based approach for bundle segmentation on a clinical dataset as compared to the traditional ROI-based approach. We performed bundle segmentation of the arcuate fasciculus, of its indirect anterior and posterior segments, and of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the healthy hemisphere of 25 high-grade glioma patients using both ROI- and streamline-based approaches. ROI-based segmentation involved manually delineating ROIs on MR anatomical images in Trackvis (V0.6.2.1). Streamline-based segmentations were performed in Tractome, which integrates clustering algorithms with the visual inspection and manipulation of streamlines. Shape analysis was conducted on each bundle. A paired t-test was performed on the irregularity measurement to compare segmentations achieved with the two approaches. Qualitative differences were evaluated through visual inspection. Streamline-based segmentation consistently yielded significantly lower irregularity scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to ROI-based segmentation for all the examined bundles, indicating more compact and accurate bundle reconstructions. Qualitative assessment identified common biases in ROI-based segmentations, such as the inclusion of anatomically implausible streamlines or streamlines with undesired trajectories. Streamline-based bundle segmentation with Tractome provides reliable and more accurate reconstructions compared to the ROI-based approach. By directly manipulating streamlines rather than relying on voxel-based ROI delineations, Tractome allows us to discern and discard implausible or undesired streamlines and to identify the course of WM bundles even when the anatomy is distorted by the lesion. These features make Tractome a robust tool for bundle segmentation in clinical contexts.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The treatment of tics and psychiatric comorbidities is crucial when they affect the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s well-being and relationships. However, the optimal pharmacological treatment (PT) tailored to each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s phenotype remains unclear. The primary objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment received for tics and psychiatric comorbidities in our cohort of children and adult patients with tic disorders. Additionally, a further aim was to quantify the severity of tics, comorbidities and overall severity, and the overall clinical changes observed during the follow-up. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of patients with tic disorders under follow-up at our Tic Functional Unit from January 2022 to March 2024. Two independent neurologists retrospectively applied the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scales at baseline and at last assessment. Results: A total of 36 individuals were included (63.8% males, median age = 18 years, IQR 19): 94.4% with Tourette syndrome (TS), 2.8% with chronic tic disorder (CTD), and 2.8% with provisional tic disorder (PTD). A total of 86% had at least one psychiatric comorbidity, the most common being obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptomatology (OCS) (52%), anxiety (52%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%). At last assessment, 26 patients (72.2%) were on undergoing PT for tics and 3 were receiving additional botulinum toxin. The most used medication for tics were aripiprazole (46.2%) and clonazepam (46.2%), and for psychiatric comorbidities, SSRIs (42.9%), methylphenidate (19%), and benzodiazepines (57.1%). Overall improvement according to the CGI-C scale was mild (CGI-C 3). Children and adolescents showed greater improvement than adults (CGI-C 2 vs. 3; p = 0.005). Aripiprazole and clonazepam produced similar outcomes in reducing CGI-C. Conclusions: We observed a favorable clinical course in patients treated with aripiprazole and clonazepam, which appear to be better than that obtained with other treatments. We consider that clonazepam may be useful as a first-line monotherapy and as an adjuvant for both tics and comorbidities in selected cases.</p>

	<p>To date, no psychotropic medication has been shown to effectively halt progression to psychosis among individuals at Clinical HighRisk of psychosis (CHR), fueling the search for novel therapeutic agents. Recent evidence supports Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) signaling as a potential psychosis biomarker, also indicating a therapeutic role for its supplementation in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Nonetheless, the effect of sustained PEA intake in CHR subjects has not explored so far. We will assess the feasibility of enrolling 20 CHR young adults presenting with attenuated psychotic symptoms (APSs) in a 12-week, open-label, investigator-initiated, proof-of-concept, single-arm trial of ultramicronized-PEA (um-PEA) at a dose of 600 mg/day. Once having completed the 12-week phase, participants will be asked to enter a 24-week extension phase of the study. We will examine um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to reduce APSs and psychic distress, um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety and tolerability, and the biological basis of um-PEA&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect in terms of modulation of inflammatory response, endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, and microbiome composition. Our trial aims to address an unmet clinical need in CHR subjects, providing an initial solid basis for the development of future studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of PEA supplementation in this group of patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects approximately 250,000 to 500,000 individuals annually. Current therapeutic interventions predominantly focus on mitigating the impact of physical and neurological impairments, with limited functional recovery observed in many patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations have been investigated in this context of rehabilitation to identify effective markers for optimizing rehabilitation treatments. Methods: We performed an exploratory cross-sectional study assessing the baseline EEG resting state of 86 participants with SCI as part of the Deficit of Inhibitory as a Marker of Neuroplasticity in Rehabilitation Cohort Study (DEFINE). Results: Our multivariate models demonstrated a positive correlation between frontal delta asymmetry and depression symptoms, while the frontal alpha asymmetry band and anxiety symptoms were negatively correlated. Theta oscillations were negatively associated with motor-evoked potential (MEP), whereas alpha oscillations were positively associated with MEP in all regions of interest and with CPM response as a negative correlation. Based on the potential role of lower-frequency oscillations in exerting a salutogenic compensatory effect, detrimental clinical and neurophysiological markers, such as depression and lower ME, likely induce slow oscillatory rhythms. Alpha oscillations may indicate a more salutogenic state, often associated with various cognitive functions, such as attention and memory processing. Conclusions: These results show an attempt by the CNS to reorganize and restore function despite the disruption caused by SCI. Indeed, this finding also challenges the notion that low-frequency EEG rhythms are associated with cortical lesions. These results may contribute to the development of rehabilitation strategies and potentially improve the clinical outcomes of patients with SCI.</p>

                Background Lumbar radicular discomfort is often induced by mechanical compression of the nerve root and inflammatory reactions. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an efficacious therapy modality, albeit ongoing controversies regarding its effectiveness, and it possesses the advantage of minimal side effects. Therefore, we conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of PRP in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Methods We conducted our database searching on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception till August 2024 to look for articles that fulfil our aim. The search strategy was based on three main keywords: “Platelet-rich plasma” AND “Lumbar” AND “Hernia*”. We conducted the pooled analysis of continuous variables using mean difference (MD) and we used pooled odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results The use of PRP was statistically significant associated with reduced visual analogue scale (VAS) compared with no PRP with MD of -0.44 (95%CI:-0.76, -0.11, p=0.008), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) with MD of -5.36 (95%CI: -8.25, -2.48, p=0.0003). However, no significant difference was observed regarding Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) with MD of 2.52 (95%CI:-0.8, 5.84, p=0.14) with non-significant heterogeneity. PRP was also associated with reduced risk of complications with OR of 0.22 (95%CI:0.07, 0.68, p=0.009) and non-significant heterogeneity. Conclusion PRP use in patients with LDH is associated with positive outcomes presented in reduction of pain, and disability (decrease in ODI scale) in addition to being safe with less incidence of complications compared with patients not receiving PRP.

                Background The use of mindfulness in the treatment of anxiety and depression is becoming more and more widespread, but there are few reports that it has fundamentally changed patients’ sense of life. Case Presentation This report showed 9 year’s progress of treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder in a 41-year-old female patient experiencing a long-term painful married life with a reckless husband and controlling mother-in-law. During the past 25 months, she received 180 sessions of mindfulness training, resulting in complete remission of the anxiety and depression symptoms. After the 30th session she experienced an episode of the catharsis during the mindfulness training and experienced what can be called Mindfulness-To-Meaning, which is characterized by durable eudaimonic well-being in the face of adversity. Conclusions The psychological mechanisms that supported arriving at Mindfulness-To-Meaning are delineated as: Heightened (1) awareness which promoted (2) verbalization of the primary theme of suppression, in which the stress was (3) appraised metacognitively. Then (4) decentering permitted integrating this painful theme into a new adaptive self and world view, which resulted in (5) emotional catharsis, or release. Furthermore (6) positive appraisal of this experience enhanced awareness and led to the experience of (7) Mindfulness-To-Meaning.

                Background Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and lower probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were age 70-80 (OR 3.267, p = 0.029), age >80 (OR 27.043, p < 0.001) and GCS < 15 (OR 8.728, p < 0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies, CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                The study focused on drug discovery for COVID-19, emphasizing the challenges posed by the pandemic and the importance of understanding the virus’s biology. The research utilized molecular docking and quantum similarity analyses to explore potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Docking Results Docking outcomes for various ligands, including Oseltamivir, Prochloraz, Valacyclovir, Baricitinib, Molnupiravir, Penciclovir, Famciclovir, Lamivudine, and Nitazoxanide, were presented. Interactions between ligands and specific residues in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were analyzed. Reactivity Descriptors Global parameters, such as electronic chemical potential, chemical hardness, global softness, and global electrophilicity, were computed for the ligands. For the local reactivity descriptors, the Fukui Functions were used. Fukui functions, representing electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, were calculated for selected ligands (Valacyclovir and Penciclovir). Nucleophilic character assignments for specific molecular regions were discussed, providing insights into potential charge-donating interactions. Results and Discussion Challenges in COVID-19 drug discovery, such as virus mutability, rapid evolution, and resource limitations, were summarized. Progress in vaccine development and the need for ongoing research to address variants and breakthrough cases were emphasized. Overlap Operator Analysis Higher MQSM between Lamivudine and Molnupiravir (0.5742) indicates structural and electronic similarity. Lowest MQSM between Oseltamivir and Prochloraz (0.2233) implies structural dissimilarity. Coulomb Operator Analysis Higher MQSM between Lamivudine and Molnupiravir (0.9178) suggests both structural and electronic similarity. Lowest MQSM between Baricitinib and Famciclovir (0.6001) indicates greater structural diversity. Measurements above 0.5 in Table 3 suggest electronic similarity, emphasizing the electronic aspects in molecular analysis. In this sense, it study employed a multi-faceted approach combining molecular docking, quantum similarity analyses, and chemical reactivity assessments to explore potential drug candidates for COVID-19. The findings provide valuable insights into ligand interactions, reactivity patterns, and the challenges associated with drug discovery in the context of the global pandemic.

                Gender equality in decision-making positions is crucial to achieving the goals of good governance, peace, democracy, and inclusive/sustainable development. The major aim of this research article is to investigate the representation trend of women in higher decision-making positions over the last thirty years, since 1991. The federal three organs of government (law formulating, law enforcing, and law interpreting bodies) were the focus of this research. This research is a mixed type of research that inculcates both qualitative and quantitative data types. Secondary data sources from relevant government institutions were mostly used. The data was analyzed through content analysis of documents and presented via descriptive data presenting techniques. The research findings reveal that although women’s representation in positions of decision-making has advanced considerably in recent years, the empirical data throughout the previous thirty years demonstrated the underrepresentation of women in higher leadership positions within the Ethiopian federal government. Furthermore, Women never held certain higher-level government leadership positions, such as the Prime Minister position, which seems to be forbidden for women. Women made up 23%, 19%, 19%, and 24% of the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), the House of Federation (HoF), ministerial posts, and judicial bodies, respectively over the last three decades. Women are visibly underrepresented in the executive positions as compared to others. Thus, substantial policy and practical initiatives are needed to remove institutional, social, and economic barriers to boost women’s advanced visibility in senior leadership roles.

                Introduction Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common and disabling musculoskeletal ailments among patients with shoulder pain. Although most individuals show improvement in function and pain following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), a subgroup of patients continue to suffer from persistent shoulder pain following the surgical procedure. Identifying these factors is important in planning preoperative management to improve patient outcomes. Objective This scoping review aims to identify biological factors, psychological factors, and social determinants of health contributing to the development of persistent pain in individuals after the ARCR procedure. Inclusion criteria All prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies reporting the risk factors contributing to persistent pain three months or longer after the ARCR surgery will be considered for this scoping review. Methods Our review will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Four electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus will be searched for studies in the English language. Additional studies can be found by conducting a citation analysis of the included studies. Title and abstract screening will be performed by two independent reviewers following the inclusion criteria, a third reviewer will be consulted about any differences. Next, full-text screening will be conducted, and the remaining search results will be reviewed to extract data, as well as to synthesize findings from all research. An overview of findings will be depicted in tabular format accompanied by a narrative summary of various factors contributing to persistent pain.

                Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure throughout gestation and breastfeeding leads to multiple adverse outcomes in the hepatic system. Under oxidative stress, alterations in the liver are related to the inhibition of induced nitric oxide synthase activity in sinusoidal cells as a consequence of low expression of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinase interacting (GIT1). Here, we hypothesized that both glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and GIT1 could be altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of human equivalent development. Methods We exposed rats during the third trimester equivalent [postnatal days (PD) 2-8] to moderate levels of maternal EtOH (20%). GPx1 and GIT1 expression was detected by western blotting, and the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase GPx and the concentration of hepatic carbonyl groups (CG were determined by spectrophotometry. Serum biochemistry parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose (gluc), cholesterol (chol), and triglycerides (TG) were also measured. Results We found that ethanol decreased both GIT1 and GPx1 selenoprotein expression, affecting GPx antioxidant activity and increasing protein oxidation. Conclusions These results demonstrate for the first time that the GPx antioxidant system altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of development is related to a parallel decrease in GIT1 expression [1].

                Background Dermatophytes are the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide and are treated with prescribed regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, or with weekly doses of fluconazole. Dermatologists are increasingly encountering treatment failures, and experts suggest that standard treatment regimens are not applicable anymore. We planned an open-label study to evaluate the results of fluconazole 150 mg daily for 8 weeks in patients with tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Methods Patients were enrolled from the La’Mer Clinic, Mumbai, India. We included adult subjects with uncomplicated dermatophytosis confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Pregnancy, poor renal function, and recent exposure to anti-fungal therapy were exclusion criteria. Patients were reviewed on days 14, 28 and 56. The treating doctor scored the severity of erythema, scaling, and pruritus on a four-point scale: absent, mild, moderate, and severe. Of 107 subjects screened, 100 were finally included in the study. Eleven were lost to follow up and one subject withdrew consent. Results The site of disease was body alone in 29, groin alone in 7, and both body and groin in 64 cases. At 5 weeks, 98%, 100%, and 97% of patients had no scaling, erythema, and pruritus, respectively. Skin scrapings showed 100% mycological cure. In one patient the alanine transaminase level rose from 54.9 to 100.2 U/L, and qualified as a grade 1 adverse event not requiring intervention. No other significant adverse events were noted. Conclusions Our results suggest that fluconazole 150 mg daily for eight weeks effectively treats dermatophytosis. This regimen is safe and well-tolerated even in patients with co-morbidities. Fluconazole is about eight times less expensive than itraconazole or terbinafine and may be the preferred therapy. Registration The trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry, India (Registration number CTRI/2020/06/026110) on 24 June 2020. FDC Company, India, provided financial support for the study.

                Objective This study aimed to examine the mediating role of meal planning in the relationship between role modeling and snack choice. Methods and Measures The study was correlational and quantitative in nature. The study selected a sample of 403 university students. We collected data through interviews using a questionnaire. We analyzed the data using SPSS 23.0.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1989, 2015) (Build 1607) and AMOS 23.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1983, 2015) (Build 1607) software for correlational and Confirmatory factor tests. We used the bootstrapping technique to test for the mediation effect of meal planning. Results Meal planning had a full mediation effect between role modeling and snack choice. This means that Role modeling had a significant influence on meal planning, meal planning had a significant influence on snack choice, and role modeling had no significant influence on snack choice. Conclusion when young people admire other people’s eating habits it leads them to plan their meals and choose similar snacks to their role models. Future studies should consider studying the effect that role models’ proximity has on snack choices among young people in other contexts.

                Background This study investigates the incidence and predictive factors of Hyperventilation Syndrome (HVS) in patients after COVID 19 pneumonia, addressing the clinical overlap between these conditions. Methods A one-month prospective study was conducted, tracking survivors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were evaluated for ongoing clinical status, including HVS and post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD), using clinical questionnaires, mMRC, Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Score, Nijmegen score, and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 questionnaire. Results Our study included 222 patients (median age: 57 years, male predominance 62.6%). Somatic comorbidities, primarily metabolic disorders, were reported in 71.2% of cases. The majority had severe or critical infection forms (78.4%), and 91.9% experienced acute symptoms, with 86.5% having three or more symptom clusters. At one month follow-up, dyspnea (52.9%) and asthenia (21.7%) persisted. Functional limitations (PCFS Grade > 2) were observed in 19.6% of patients. The overall incidence of HVS was 158 per 1000 patients, and PTSD was 445 per 1000 patients. Multivariate logistic regression identified cognitive impairment (acute phase), persistent weight loss (post-COVID-19 phase), PCFS grade > 2, and PTSD as independent factors for developing HVS, with relative risks (RRs) of 3.47 (95%CI [1.48-8.31]; p = 0.004), 11.87 (95%CI [1.25-112.88]; p = 0.031), 3.24 (95%CI [1.34-7.86]; p = 0.009), and 5.98 (95%CI [2.27-15.77]; p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion HVS is prevalent in the post-COVID-19 phase, affecting 15.6 % of survivors. Identified predictive factors suggest the convergence of psychosomatic pathophysiological mechanisms. Further research is crucial for a detailed understanding of these mechanisms in long COVID-19 patients.

                Background Pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, represents 10-15% of intracranial tumors. Although non-cancerous, its size and location can cause significant health issues, including hormonal imbalances and compression of nearby structures like the optic chiasm, leading to conditions such as Cushing’s disease, acromegaly, and visual disturbances. The prevalence ranges from 46 to 95 per 100,000 individuals. This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine versus placebo in patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines included 10 RCTs with 633 patients. English-language RCTs were sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROB2 tool, and statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3. Results Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced heart rate after intubation (MD: -6.61 bpm, 95% CI: -8.98 to -4.24, p < 0.00001) and post-extubation (MD: -6.77 bpm, 95% CI: -8.59 to -4.96, p < 0.00001). Mean arterial pressure decreased after intubation (MD: -10.49 mmHg, 95% CI: -12.73 to -8.26, p < 0.00001) and post-extubation (MD: -12.97 mmHg, 95% CI: -14.37 to -11.57, p < 0.00001). Dexmedetomidine also reduced surgical duration (SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.05, p = 0.01), blood loss (MD: -109.49 mL, 95% CI: -152.60 to -66.38, p < 0.00001), propofol dose (SMD: -1.04, 95% CI: -1.72 to -0.37, p = 0.002), extubation time (SMD: -0.70, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.47, p < 0.00001), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.80, p = 0.007). Conclusions Dexmedetomidine enhances perioperative outcomes in transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas, supporting its use as an effective anesthetic adjunct.

                <p>by Andrea L. Graham, Roland R. Regoes</p>

Immune responses are induced by parasite exposure and can in turn reduce parasite burden. Despite such apparently simple rules of engagement, key drivers of within-host dynamics, including dose-dependence of defense and infection duration, have proven difficult to predict. Here, we model how varied inoculating doses interact with multi-tiered host defenses at a site of inoculation, by confronting barrier, innate, and adaptive tiers with replicating and non-replicating parasites across multiple orders of magnitude of dose. We find that, in general, intermediate parasite doses generate infections of longest duration because they are sufficient in number to breach barrier defenses, but insufficient to strongly induce subsequent tiers of defense. These doses reveal “wormholes” in defense from which parasites might profit: Deviation from the hypothesis of independent action, which postulates that each parasite has an independent probability of establishing infection, may therefore be widespread. Interestingly, our model predicts local maxima of duration at two doses–one for each tier transition. While some empirical evidence is consistent with nonlinear dose-dependencies, testing the predicted dynamics will require finer-scale dose variation than experiments usually incorporate. Our results help explain varied infection establishment and duration among differentially-exposed hosts and elucidate evolutionary pressures that shape both virulence and defense.

Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can identify and neutralise a wide variety of antigens with high specificity and affinity, and constitute the most successful class of biotherapeutics. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, billions of antibody sequences have been collected in recent years, though their application in the design of better therapeutics has been constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of the data. To address this challenge, we present IgBert and IgT5, the best performing antibody-specific language models developed to date which can consistently handle both paired and unpaired variable region sequences as input. These models are trained comprehensively using the more than two billion unpaired sequences and two million paired sequences of light and heavy chains present in the Observed Antibody Space dataset. We show that our models outperform existing antibody and protein language models on a diverse range of design and regression tasks relevant to antibody engineering. This advancement marks a significant leap forward in leveraging machine learning, large scale data sets and high-performance computing for enhancing antibody design for therapeutic development.

Modeling microbial interactions as sparse and reproducible networks is a major challenge in microbial ecology. Direct interactions between the microbial species of a biome can help to understand the mechanisms through which microbial communities influence the system. Most state-of-the art methods reconstruct networks from abundance data using Gaussian Graphical Models, for which several statistically grounded and computationnally efficient inference approaches are available. However, the multiplicity of existing methods, when applied to the same dataset, generates very different networks. In this article, we present OneNet, a consensus network inference method that combines seven methods based on stability selection. This resampling procedure is used to tune a regularization parameter by computing how often edges are selected in the networks. We modified the stability selection framework to use edge selection frequencies directly and combine them in the inferred network to ensure that only reproducible edges are included in the consensus. We demonstrated on synthetic data that our method generally led to slightly sparser networks while achieving much higher precision than any single method. We further applied the method to gut microbiome data from liver-cirrothic patients and demonstrated that the resulting network exhibited a microbial guild that was meaningful in terms of human health.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) disease, severity and age of onset vary greatly, hindering to objectively measure and predict clinical progression. Thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer is distinctive of ARSACS patients, as assessed by optical coherence tomography, whereas conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging findings include both supratentorial and infratentorial changes. Because longitudinal imaging studies in ARSACS patients are not available to define these changes as biomarkers of disease progression, we aimed to address this issue in the ARSACS mouse model.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed longitudinal retinal OCT and brain MRI in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> ARSACS mouse model, alongside motor and coordination assessment in the beam walking test. We also investigated visual function and the molecular mechanisms underlying RNFL increased thickness by histology and immunofluorescence.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrated that RNFL thickening by OCT gradually increases in the early stages of pathology in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model, reflecting the progression of motor impairment, and later reaches a plateau when thinning of the posterior corpus callosum becomes detectable by MRI. Mechanistically, we unveiled that RNFL thickening is associated with aberrant accumulation of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H and glial fibrillary acidic protein. We also uncovered mild signs of myelin pathology coherent with increased latency of visual evoked potentials, and altered retinal activation by photopic electroretinography.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that both RNFL thickening and MRI changes may represent biomarkers of disease progression in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Our data gathers knowledge instrumental to clinical studies, holding potential as readout for treatment efficacy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is recognized for its potent antibacterial properties and is commonly used in dentistry to treat carious lesions. This review aims to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentine caries in permanent teeth. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature to assess the efficacy of SDF in combating cariogenic flora within dentin lesions. Materials and Methods A systematic electronic search was conducted using Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2010 and September 2022. The search strategy focused on retrieving in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentinal caries. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that compared SDF with other antimicrobial agents, such as sodium fluoride varnish, potassium iodide, silver nitrate, chlorhexidine, plasma jet, and deionized water. The Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool was employed to evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of seven in vitro and in situ studies investigating the antimicrobial effect of SDF on dentinal caries, and two in vitro and in vivo studies examining its antibacterial effect on root caries. These studies collectively demonstrated the promising antimicrobial potential of SDF against cariogenic flora present in dentin lesions. However, variations in study design, methodology, and outcome measures were observed across the included studies. Conclusion The review underscores the significant antimicrobial efficacy of SDF in combating cariogenic bacteria within dentin lesions of permanent teeth. Despite the promising findings, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the precise characteristics and mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial action of SDF, particularly concerning nano-silver. Future research, including long-term clinical trials, is warranted to elucidate optimal dosage regimens and therapeutic approaches for the routine application of SDF in managing dental caries.

                This correspondence discusses the recent findings by Straalen et al., highlighting molecular similarities and distinctions between palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema (DPE). The study emphasizes shared proinflammatory pathways and T-cell–related gene upregulation while detailing unique features such as neutrophil involvement in PPP and lipid antigen processing in DPE. We elaborate on histopathological differences, especially intraepidermal vesicle formation in PPP linked to IL–1–mediated pathways and the absence of hyaluronan expression, contrasting with Th2 cytokines-driven spongiosis in DPE. By addressing IL-4, hyaluronan synthases, and keratinocyte adhesion molecules, this correspondence aims to deepen understanding of PPP and DPE pathophysiology.

                This study investigates the histidine kinase (HK) gene repertoire of Enterobacter hormaechei strain HCF3, isolated from fresh cow dung in Mogosane Village, Northwest Province, South Africa. Histidine kinases are critical components of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems, enabling bacteria to sense and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. Given the growing concern over antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated with E. hormaechei, this research elucidates the genetic components that facilitate its environmental adaptability. After isolating the strain, genomic sequencing using Illumina technology, resulting in high-quality sequence data, was conducted. The assembled genome was meticulously annotated and deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under BioProject number PRJNA991313, with additional accession numbers for raw reads (JAUOLV000000000.1) and BioSample (SAMN36292742). Histidine kinase genes were identified based on conserved domains, particularly HisKA and HATPase. This led to compiling a comprehensive HK gene catalogue with locus tags, protein accession numbers, and functional annotations. To validate the HK gene set of E. hormaechei HCF3, we conducted a rigorous comparative analysis with other strains. This revealed that strain HCF1 contains 21 histidine kinase genes, HCF2 has 25, while HCF4 has 19. These findings underscore the diversity and conservation of HK genes across different Enterobacter species, providing a new perspective on their evolutionary significance. The assembled dataset provides valuable insights into the signalling pathways of E. hormaechei, highlighting the potential roles of HKs in environmental sensing, adaptation, and pathogenicity. Furthermore, this research lays the groundwork for future studies on the applications of these genes in agriculture and biotechnology, offering new avenues for understanding and managing E. hormaechei in various ecological contexts.

                Here, we present novel high quality genome assemblies for five invasive tephritid species of agricultural concern: Ceratitis capitata, C. quilicii, C. rosa, Zeugodacus cucurbitae and Bactrocera zonata (read depths between 65 and 78x). Three assemblies (C. capitata, C. quilicii and Z. cucurbitae) were scaffolded with chromosome conformation data and annotated using RNAseq reads. For some species this is the first reference genome available (B. zonata, C. quilicii and C. rosa), for others we have published improved annotated genomes (C. capitata and Z. cucurbitae). Together, the new references provide an important resource to advance research on genetic techniques for population control, develop rapid species identification methods, and explore eco-evolutionary studies.

                Objective This study aimed to evaluate hematologic, biochemical, and gasometric parameters in Wistar rats to better understand brain death parameters and reduce early misdiagnoses. Methods Fifteen adult male Wistar rats (Rattus norvergicus; HanUnib: WH) were randomly distributed into three groups of five animals: the control group (G0) with evaluation performed before brain death, and two groups (G1 and G2) with brain death induced at different times: immediately after induction (G1) and one hour after induction (G2). Venous and arterial blood samples were taken to perform complete blood count, biochemical, and blood gas assays. Samples were taken at specific times based on the group each rat belonged to. Results Statistically significant mean values were observed (P<0,05) for segmented cells (G1>G2 and G0>G2), monocytes (G2>G1 and G0>G1), creatinine (G2>G0), aspartate aminotransferase (G1>G0), potassium (G2>G0), and bicarbonate (G0>G1). Discussion Furthermore, brain death showed a unique response in each organism, complicating its precise determination even more.

                Jacquet et al. shows that microglia use digestive exophagy to engage large Aβ deposits that cannot be phagocytosed, forming acidic extracellular compartments on the aggregates into which lysosomal enzymes are exocytosed. The PI3K-AKT pathway modulates this process. Microglia also exocytose intralysosomal undigested fibrillar Aβ toward extracellular aggregates, potentially contributing to plaque growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96424">Lineage-specific intersection of endothelin and GDNF signaling in enteric nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Two major ligand-receptor signaling axes – endothelin Edn3 and its receptor Ednrb, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor Ret – are required for migration of enteric nervous system (ENS) progenitors to the hindgut. Mutations in either component cause colonic aganglionosis, also called Hirschsprung disease. Here, we have used Wnt1Cre and Pax2Cre in mice to show that these driver lines label distinct ENS lineages during progenitor migration and in their terminal hindgut fates. Both Cre lines result in Hirschsprung disease when combined with conditional <i>Ednrb</i> or conditional <i>Ret</i> alleles. In vitro explant assays and analysis of lineage-labeled mutant embryos show that GDNF but not Edn3 is a migration cue for cells of both lineages. Instead, Edn3-Ednrb function is required in both for GDNF responsiveness albeit in different ways: by expanding the Ret<sup>+</sup> population in the Pax2Cre lineage, and by supporting Ret function in Wnt1Cre-derived cells. Our results demonstrate that two distinct lineages of progenitors give rise to the ENS, and that these divergently utilize endothelin signaling to support migration to the hindgut.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96951">Increased inflammatory signature in myeloid cells of non-small cell lung cancer patients with high clonal hematopoiesis burden</a></h4>

              
                Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) allows estimation of clonal dynamics and documentation of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system. Recent studies utilizing large cohorts of the general population and patients have revealed significant associations of CHIP burden with age and disease status, including in cancer and chronic diseases. An increasing number of cancer patients are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the association of ICI response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with CHIP burden remains to be determined. We collected blood samples from 100 metastatic NSCLC patients before and after ICI for high-depth sequencing of the CHIP panel and 63 samples for blood single-cell RNA sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed in an independent replication cohort of 180 patients. The impact of CHIP status on the immunotherapy response was not significant. However, metastatic lung cancer patients showed higher CHIP prevalence (44/100 for patients vs. 5/42 for controls; p = 0.01). In addition, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients showed increased burden of larger clones compared to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients (8/43 for LUSC vs. 2/50 for LUAD; p = 0.04). Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the matched patients showed significant enrichment of inflammatory pathways mediated by NF-κB in myeloid clusters of the severe CHIP group. Our findings suggest minimal involvement of CHIP mutation and clonal dynamics during immunotherapy but a possible role of CHIP as an indicator of immunologic response in NSCLC patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91642">A cryo-electron tomography study of ciliary rootlet organization</a></h4>

              
                Ciliary rootlets are striated bundles of filaments that connect the base of cilia to internal cellular structures. Rootlets are critical for the sensory and motile functions of cilia. However, the mechanisms underlying these functions remain unknown, in part due to a lack of structural information of rootlet organization. In this study, we obtain 3D reconstructions of membrane-associated and purified rootlets from mouse retina using cryo-electron tomography. We show that flexible protrusions on the rootlet surface, which emanate from the cross-striations, connect to intracellular membranes. In purified rootlets, the striations were classified into amorphous (A)-bands, associated with accumulations on the rootlet surface, and discrete (D)-bands corresponding to punctate lines of density that run through the rootlet. These striations connect a flexible network of longitudinal filaments. Subtomogram averaging suggests the filaments consist of two intertwined coiled coils. The rootlet’s filamentous architecture, with frequent membrane-connecting cross-striations, lends itself well for anchoring large membranes in the cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88319">The cation channel mechanisms of subthreshold inward depolarizing currents in the mice VTA dopaminergic neurons and their roles in the chronic-stress-induced depression-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                The slow-intrinsic-pacemaker dopaminergic (DA) neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in various mood- and emotion-related disorders, such as anxiety, fear, stress and depression. Abnormal activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons is the key factor in the development of these disorders. Here, we describe the crucial role of the NALCN and TRPC6, non-selective cation channels in mediating the subthreshold inward depolarizing current and driving the firing of action potentials of VTA DA neurons in physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression in the VTA DA neurons likely contributes to the reduced activity of projection-specific VTA DA neurons in chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) depressive mice. In consistent with these, selective knockdown of TRPC6 channels in the VTA DA neurons conferred mice with depression-like behavior. This current study suggests down-regulation of TRPC6 expression/function is involved in reduced VTA DA neuron firing and chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior of mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97255">Reversing protonation of weakly basic drugs greatly enhances intracellular diffusion and decreases lysosomal sequestration</a></h4>

              
                For drugs to be active they have to reach their targets. Within cells this requires crossing the cell membrane, and then free diffusion, distribution, and availability. Here, we explored the in-cell diffusion rates and distribution of a series of small molecular fluorescent drugs, in comparison to proteins, by microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). While all proteins diffused freely, we found a strong correlation between p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> and the intracellular diffusion and distribution of small molecule drugs. Weakly basic, small-molecule drugs displayed lower fractional recovery after photobleaching and 10- to-20-fold slower diffusion rates in cells than in aqueous solutions. As, more than half of pharmaceutical drugs are weakly basic, they, are protonated in the cell cytoplasm. Protonation, facilitates the formation of membrane impermeable ionic form of the weak base small molecules. This results in ion trapping, further reducing diffusion rates of weakly basic small molecule drugs under macromolecular crowding conditions where other nonspecific interactions become more relevant and dominant. Our imaging studies showed that acidic organelles, particularly the lysosome, captured these molecules. Surprisingly, blocking lysosomal import only slightly increased diffusion rates and fractional recovery. Conversely, blocking protonation by <i>N-</i>acetylated analogues, greatly enhanced their diffusion and fractional recovery after FRAP. Based on these results, <i>N</i>-acetylation of small molecule drugs may improve the intracellular availability and distribution of weakly basic, small molecule drugs within cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89023">Modulation of RNA processing genes during sleep-dependent memory</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation in <i>Drosophila</i> can be sleep-dependent or sleep-independent, depending on the availability of food. The anterior posterior (ap) alpha′/beta′ (α′/β′) neurons of the mushroom body (MB) are required for sleep-dependent memory consolidation in flies fed after training. These neurons are also involved in the increase of sleep after training, suggesting a coupling of sleep and memory. To better understand the mechanisms underlying sleep and memory consolidation initiation, we analyzed the transcriptome of ap α′/β′ neurons 1 hr after appetitive memory conditioning. A small number of genes, enriched in RNA processing functions, were differentially expressed in flies fed after training relative to trained and starved flies or untrained flies. Knockdown of each of these differentially expressed genes in the ap α′/β′ neurons revealed notable sleep phenotypes for Polr1F and Regnase-1, both of which decrease in expression after conditioning. Knockdown of Polr1F, a regulator of ribosome RNA transcription, in adult flies promotes sleep and increases pre-ribosome RNA expression as well as overall translation, supporting a function for Polr1F downregulation in sleep-dependent memory. Conversely, while constitutive knockdown of Regnase-1, an mRNA decay protein localized to the ribosome, reduces sleep, adult specific knockdown suggests that effects of Regnase-1 on sleep are developmental in nature. We further tested the role of each gene in memory consolidation. Knockdown of Polr1F does not affect memory, which may be expected from its downregulation during memory consolidation. Regnase-1 knockdown in ap α′/β′ neurons impairs all memory, including short-term, implicating Regnase-1 in memory, but leaving open the question of why it is downregulated during sleep-dependent memory. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the expression of RNA processing genes is modulated during sleep-dependent memory and, in the case of Polr1F, this modulation likely contributes to increased sleep.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97507">Maternal obesity may disrupt offspring metabolism by inducing oocyte genome hyper-methylation via increased DNMTs</a></h4>

              
                Maternal obesity has deleterious effects on the process of establishing oocyte DNA methylation; yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that maternal obesity disrupted the genomic methylation of oocytes using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse model, at least a part of which was transmitted to the F2 oocytes and livers via females. We further examined the metabolome of serum and found that the serum concentration of melatonin was reduced. Exogenous melatonin treatment significantly reduced the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes, and the increased expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in HFD oocytes was also decreased. These suggest that melatonin may play a key role in the disrupted genomic methylation in the oocytes of obese mice. To address how melatonin regulates the expression of DNMTs, the function of melatonin was inhibited or activated upon oocytes. Results revealed that melatonin may regulate the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. These results suggest that maternal obesity induces genomic methylation alterations in oocytes, which can be partly transmitted to F2 in females, and that melatonin is involved in regulating the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98450">Identification of suitable target/E3 ligase pairs for PROTAC development using a rapamycin-induced proximity assay (RiPA)</a></h4>

              
                The development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which induce the degradation of target proteins by bringing them into proximity with cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases, has revolutionized drug development. While the human genome encodes more than 600 different E3 ligases, current PROTACs use only a handful of them, drastically limiting their full potential. Furthermore, many PROTAC development campaigns fail because the selected E3 ligase candidates are unable to induce degradation of the particular target of interest. As more and more ligands for novel E3 ligases are discovered, the chemical effort to identify the best E3 ligase for a given target is exploding. Therefore, a genetic system to identify degradation-causing E3 ligases and suitable target/E3 ligase pairs is urgently needed. Here, we used the well-established dimerization of the FKBP12 protein and FRB domain by rapamycin to bring the target protein WDR5 into proximity with candidate E3 ligases. Strikingly, this rapamycin-induced proximity assay (RiPA) revealed that VHL, but not Cereblon, is able to induce WDR5 degradation - a finding previously made by PROTACs, demonstrating its predictive power. By optimizing the steric arrangement of all components and fusing the target protein with a minimal luciferase, RiPA can identify the ideal E3 for any target protein of interest in living cells, significantly reducing and focusing the chemical effort in the early stages of PROTAC development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92519">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal the differentiation trajectories of periosteal skeletal/stem progenitor cells in bone regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Bone regeneration is mediated by skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) that are mainly recruited from the periosteum after bone injury. The composition of the periosteum and the steps of SSPC activation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we generated a single-nucleus atlas of the periosteum at steady state and of the fracture site during the early stages of bone repair (<a href="https://fracture-repair-atlas.cells.ucsc.edu">https://fracture-repair-atlas.cells.ucsc.edu</a>). We identified periosteal SSPCs expressing stemness markers (<i>Pi16</i> and <i>Ly6a</i>/SCA1) and responding to fracture by adopting an injury-induced fibrogenic cell (IIFC) fate, prior to undergoing osteogenesis or chondrogenesis. We identified distinct gene cores associated with IIFCs and their engagement into osteogenesis and chondrogenesis involving Notch, Wnt, and the circadian clock signaling, respectively. Finally, we show that IIFCs are the main source of paracrine signals in the fracture environment, suggesting a crucial paracrine role of this transient IIFC population during fracture healing. Overall, our study provides a complete temporal topography of the early stages of fracture healing and the dynamic response of periosteal SSPCs to injury, redefining our knowledge of bone regeneration.

	<p>Background: Congenital craniovertebral junction anomalies (CCVJAs) encompass a diverse range of conditions characterized by distorted anatomy and significant variation in the pathways of neurovascular structures. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of tailoring posterior fixation for CCVJAs through intraoperative CT-based navigation. Methods: An in-depth retrospective analysis was conducted on eight patients diagnosed with CCVJAs (excluding Arnold&amp;amp;ndash;Chiari malformation). These patients underwent posterior fixation/arthrodesis facilitated by intraoperative CT-based navigation. The analysis included an examination of the fixation strategies, complication rates, length of stay, post-operative complications, and success of arthrodesis. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to contextualize and compare our findings. Results: Patients undergoing CVJ posterior fixation with intraoperative CT-based navigation exhibited a flawless record, devoid of complications related to the damage to neurovascular structures, as well as any instances of screw misposition, pullout, or breakage (0 out of 36 total screws). Furthermore, the entire cohort demonstrated a 100% arthrodesis rate. None of the patients required treatment with an occipital plate. Conclusions: The incorporation of intraoperative CT-based navigation proves to be an invaluable asset in executing CVJ posterior fixation within the context of CCVJAs. This technology facilitates the customization of posterior constructs, a crucial adaptation required to navigate the anatomical challenges posed by these anomalies. The secure placement of screws into the occipital condyles, made possible by navigation, has proven highly effective in achieving CVJ fixation, obviating the need for an occipital plate. This technological leap represents a significant advancement, enhancing the safety, precision, and overall outcomes for patients undergoing this surgical procedure, while concurrently reducing the necessity for more invasive and morbid interventions.</p>

                <p>Goal-directed actions require transforming sensory information into motor plans defined across multiple parameters and reference frames. Substantial evidence supports the encoding of target direction in gaze- and body-centered coordinates within parietal and premotor regions. However, how the brain encodes the equally critical parameter of target distance remains less understood. Here, using Bayesian pattern component modeling of fMRI data during a delayed reach-to-target task, we dissociated the neural encoding of both target direction and the relative distances between target, gaze, and hand at early and late stages of motor planning. This approach revealed independent representations of direction and distance along the human dorsomedial reach pathway. During early planning, most premotor and superior parietal areas encoded a target&rsquo;s distance in single or multiple reference frames and encoded its direction. In contrast, distance encoding was magnified in gaze- and body-centric reference frames during late planning. These results emphasize a flexible and efficient human central nervous system that achieves goals by remapping sensory information related to multiple parameters, such as distance and direction, in the same brain areas.</p>

                Background Surgical procedures on the cervical spine are frequently performed to treat spinal diseases such as degenerative disc degeneration, trauma, tumors, and infections. However, postoperative complications are a cause for concern, and the surgical procedure with the lowest complication risk still unknown. Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out in different databases from the beginning of the study to January 2024. Observational studies that reported the incidence of postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF), laminoplasty, laminectomy with fusion, and corpectomy were included in the review. Outcomes like reoperation rates, infections, and nerve injuries were analyzed using random-effects models, with ORs (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 13 studies with 22,874 patients were included. ACDF was associated with higher complication rates versus PCF (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.60) and laminoplasty (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.41). Laminectomy with fusion showed greater pseudarthrosis (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.90) and reoperation rates (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.43) than ACDF. No differences were detected between other procedures. Conclusion Complications risk significantly differs based on surgical strategy and technique, with ACDF potentially having higher rates compared to less invasive methods.

                Fibroblasts, non-hematopoietic cells of mesenchymal origin, are tissue architects which regulate the topography of tissues, dictate tissue resident cell types, and drive fibrotic disease. Fibroblasts regulate the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a 3-dimensional network of macromolecules that comprise the acellular milieu of tissues. Fibroblasts can directly and indirectly regulate immune responses by secreting ECM and ECM-bound molecules to shape tissue structure and influence organ function. In this review, we will highlight recent studies which elucidate the mechanisms by which fibroblast-derived ECM factors (e.g., collagens, fibrillar proteins) regulate ECM architecture and subsequent immune responses, with a focus on macrophages. As examples of fibroblast-derived ECM proteins, we examine Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1 (CTHRC1) and Transforming Growth Factor-β-inducible protein (TGFBI), also known as BIGH3. We address the need for investigation into how diverse fibroblast populations coordinate immune responses by modulating ECM, including the fibroblast-ECM-immune axis and the precise molecular mediators and pathways which regulate these processes. Finally, we will outline how novel research identifying key regulators of ECM deposition is critical for therapeutic development for fibrotic diseases and cancer.

The ready availability of brain connectome data has both inspired and facilitated the modelling of whole brain activity using networks of phenomenological neural mass models that can incorporate both interaction strength and tract length between brain regions. Recently, a new class of neural mass model has been developed from an exact mean field reduction of a network of spiking cortical cell models with a biophysically realistic model of the chemical synapse. Moreover, this new population dynamics model can naturally incorporate electrical synapses. Here we demonstrate the ability of this new modelling framework, when combined with data from the Human Connectome Project, to generate patterns of functional connectivity (FC) of the type observed in both magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. Some limited explanatory power is obtained via an eigenmode description of frequency-specific FC patterns, obtained via a linear stability analysis of the network steady state in the neigbourhood of a Hopf bifurcation. However, direct numerical simulations show that empirical data is more faithfully recapitulated in the nonlinear regime, and exposes a key role of gap junction coupling strength in generating empirically-observed neural activity, and associated FC patterns and their evolution. Thereby, we emphasise the importance of maintaining known links with biological reality when developing multi-scale models of brain dynamics. As a tool for the study of dynamic whole brain models of the type presented here we further provide a suite of C++ codes for the efficient, and user friendly, simulation of neural mass networks with multiple delayed interactions.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.

                <p>by Hind Zaaraoui, Clarisse Schumer, Xavier Duval, Bruno Hoen, Lulla Opatowski, Jérémie Guedj</p>

Households are a major driver of transmission of acute respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza. Until now antiviral treatments have mostly been used as a curative treatment in symptomatic individuals. During an outbreak, more aggressive strategies involving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP or PEP) could be employed to further reduce the risk of severe disease but also prevent transmission to household contacts. In order to understand the effectiveness of such strategies and the factors that may modulate them, we developed a multi-scale model that follows the infection at both the individual-level (viral dynamics) and the population-level (transmission dynamics) in households. Using a simulation study we explored different antiviral treatment strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on reducing the transmission risk and the virological burden in households for a range of virus characteristics (e.g., secondary attack rate—SAR, or time to peak viral load). We found that when the index case can be identified and treated before symptom onset, both transmission and virological burden are reduced by > 75% for most SAR values and time to peak viral load, with minimal benefit to treat additionally household contacts. While treatment initiated after index symptom onset does not reduce the risk of transmission, it can still reduce the virological burden in the household, a proxy for severe disease and subsequent transmission risk outside the household. In that case optimal strategies involve treatment of both index case and household contacts as PEP, with efficacy > 50% when peak viral load occurs after symptom onset, and 30-50% otherwise. In all the considered cases, antiviral treatment strategies were optimal for SAR ranging 20-60%, and for larger household sizes. This study highlights the opportunity of antiviral drug-based interventions in households during an outbreak to minimize viral transmission and disease burden.

                <p>by Nan Zhang, Linan Zhuang, Marco-Felipe King, Hua Qian, Min Zhu</p>

Norovirus, primarily transmitted via fomite route, poses a significant threat to global public health and the economy. Airports, as critical transportation hubs connecting people from around the world, has high potential risk of norovirus transmission due to large number of public surfaces. A total of 21.3 hours of video episodes were recorded across nine functional areas at the airport, capturing 25,925 touches. A surface transmission model based on a Markov chain was developed. Using the beta-Poisson dose-response model, the infection risk of norovirus and the effectiveness of various interventions in different airports’ areas were quantified. Without any preventive measures, restaurants at airports exhibited the highest risk of norovirus transmission, with an infection probability of 8.8×10<sup>−3</sup>% (95% CI, 1.5×10<sup>−3</sup>% -2.1×10<sup>−2</sup>%). This means approximately 4.6 (95% CI, 0.8–10.9) out of 51,494 passengers who entered the restaurants would be infected by an infected passenger. Comparing with no surface disinfection, disinfecting public surfaces every 2 hours can reduce the risk of norovirus infection per visit to the airport by 83.2%. In contrast, comparing with no hand washing, handwashing every 2 hours can reduce the infection risk per visit to the airport by only 2.0%, making public surface disinfection significantly more effective than handwashing. If the mask-wearing rate increases from 0% to 50%, the infection risk of norovirus would be decreased by 48.0% (95% CI, 43.5–52.3%). Furthermore, using antimicrobial copper/copper-nickel alloy coatings for most public surfaces could reduce the infection risk by 15.9%-99.2%.

To keep ahead of the evolution of resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes, national malaria control programmes must make use of a range of insecticides, both old and new, while monitoring resistance mechanisms. The outdoor-biting malaria vector <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> is of increasing concern for malaria transmission because it is apparently less susceptible to many indoor control interventions, yet knowledge of its mechanisms of resistance remains limited. Furthermore, comparatively little is known in general about resistance to non-pyrethroid insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl (PM), which are crucial for effective control in the context of globally high resistance to pyrethroids. We performed a genome-wide association study to determine the molecular mechanisms of resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin (commonly used in bednets) and PM (widespread use for indoor spraying), in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> from 2 regions in Tanzania. Genomic regions of positive selection in these populations were largely driven by copy number variants (CNVs) in gene families involved in metabolic resistance. We found evidence of a new gene cluster involved in resistance to PM, identifying a strong selective sweep tied to a CNV in the carboxylesterase genes <i>Coeae2g - Coeae6g</i>. Using complementary data from another malaria vector, <i>An</i>. <i>coluzzii</i>, in Ghana, we show that copy number at this locus is significantly associated with PM resistance. Similarly, for deltamethrin, resistance was strongly associated with a novel CNV allele in the <i>Cyp6aa</i> / <i>Cyp6p</i> cluster (<i>Cyp6aap</i>_Dup33). Against this background of metabolic resistance, resistance caused by mutations in the insecticide target sites was very rare or absent. Mutations in the pyrethroid target site <i>Vgsc</i> were at very low frequency in Tanzania, yet combining these samples with 3 <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> individuals from West Africa revealed a startling evolutionary diversity, with up to 5 independent origins of <i>Vgsc</i>-995 mutations found within just 8 haplotypes. Thus, despite having been first recorded over 10 years ago, <i>Vgsc</i> resistance mutations in Tanzanian <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i> have remained at stable low frequencies. Overall, our results provide a new copy number marker for monitoring resistance to PM in malaria mosquitoes, and reveal the complex picture of resistance patterns in <i>An</i>. <i>arabiensis</i>.

                <p>by Kota Ishibashi, Yuichi Shichino, Peixun Han, Kimi Wakabayashi, Mari Mito, Toshifumi Inada, Seisuke Kimura, Shintaro Iwasaki, Yuichiro Mishima</p>

Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision, which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms in eukaryotes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf598 recognizes collided ribosomes, triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs. However, the impact of RQC and NGD on maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish development. RNA-Seq analysis of zebrafish <i>znf598</i> mutant embryos revealed that Znf598 down-regulates mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) during the MZT. Reporter assays and disome profiling indicated that ribosomes stall and collide while translating tandem C2H2-ZFs, leading to mRNA degradation by Znf598. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF sequences in the vertebrate genome.

                <p>by Grant Kinsler, Yuping Li, Gavin Sherlock, Dmitri A. Petrov</p>

Evolution by natural selection is expected to be a slow and gradual process. In particular, the mutations that drive evolution are predicted to be small and modular, incrementally improving a small number of traits. However, adaptive mutations identified early in microbial evolution experiments, cancer, and other systems often provide substantial fitness gains and pleiotropically improve multiple traits at once. We asked whether such pleiotropically adaptive mutations are common throughout adaptation or are instead a rare feature of early steps in evolution that tend to target key signaling pathways. To do so, we conducted barcoded second-step evolution experiments initiated from 5 first-step mutations identified from a prior yeast evolution experiment. We then isolated hundreds of second-step mutations from these evolution experiments, measured their fitness and performance in several growth phases, and conducted whole genome sequencing of the second-step clones. Here, we found that while the vast majority of mutants isolated from the first-step of evolution in this condition show patterns of pleiotropic adaptation—improving both performance in fermentation and respiration growth phases—second-step mutations show a shift towards modular adaptation, mostly improving respiration performance and only rarely improving fermentation performance. We also identified a shift in the molecular basis of adaptation from genes in cellular signaling pathways towards genes involved in respiration and mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that the genes in cellular signaling pathways may be more likely to provide large, adaptively pleiotropic benefits to the organism due to their ability to coherently affect many phenotypes at once. As such, these genes may serve as the source of pleiotropic adaptation in the early stages of evolution, and once these become exhausted, organisms then adapt more gradually, acquiring smaller, more modular mutations.

                <p>by Lily D. Peck, Theo Llewellyn, Bastien Bennetot, Samuel O’Donnell, Reuben W. Nowell, Matthew J. Ryan, Julie Flood, Ricardo C. Rodríguez de la Vega, Jeanne Ropars, Tatiana Giraud, Pietro D. Spanu, Timothy G. Barraclough</p>

Outbreaks of fungal diseases have devastated plants and animals throughout history. Over the past century, the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium xylarioides</i> severely impacted coffee production across sub-Saharan Africa. To improve the disease management of such pathogens, it is crucial to understand their genetic structure and evolutionary potential. We compared the genomes of 13 historic strains spanning 6 decades and multiple disease outbreaks to investigate population structure and host specialisation. We found that <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> comprised at least 4 distinct lineages: 1 host-specific to <i>Coffea arabica</i>, 1 to <i>C</i>. <i>canephora</i> var. robusta, and 2 historic lineages isolated from various <i>Coffea</i> species. The presence/absence of large genomic regions across populations, the higher genetic similarities of these regions between species than expected based on genome-wide divergence and their locations in different loci in genomes across populations showed that horizontal transfers of effector genes from members of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> species complex contributed to host specificity. Multiple transfers into <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> populations matched different parts of the <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> mobile pathogenicity chromosome and were enriched in effector genes and transposons. Effector genes in this region and other carbohydrate-active enzymes important in the breakdown of plant cell walls were shown by transcriptomics to be highly expressed during infection of <i>C</i>. <i>arabica</i> by the fungal arabica strains. Widespread sharing of specific transposons between <i>F</i>. <i>xylarioides</i> and <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>, and the correspondence of a putative horizontally transferred regions to a <i>Starship</i> (large mobile element involved in horizontal gene transfers in fungi), reinforce the inference of horizontal transfers and suggest that mobile elements were involved. Our results support the hypothesis that horizontal gene transfers contributed to the repeated emergence of coffee wilt disease.

                Failure to reject a null hypothesis may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the absence of an association or inadequate statistical power. Because an estimate (and its variance) can never be exactly zero, traditional statistical tests cannot conclusively demonstrate the absence of an association. Instead, estimates of accuracy should be used to identify settings in which an association and its variability are sufficiently small to be clinically acceptable, directly providing information on safety and efficacy. Post-hoc power calculations should be avoided, as they offer no additional information beyond statistical tests and p-values. Furthermore, post-hoc power calculations can be misleading because of an inability to distinguish between results based on insufficient sample size and results that reflect clinically irrelevant differences. Most multiple testing procedures unrealistically assume that all positive results are false positives. However, in applied settings, results typically represent a mix of true and false positives. This implies that multiplicity corrections do not effectively differentiate between true and false positives. Instead, considering the distributions of p-values and the proportion of significant results can help to identify bodies of evidence unlikely to be driven by false-positive results. In conclusion, rather than attempting to categorize results as true or false, medical research should embrace established statistical methods that focus on estimation accuracy, replication, and consistency.

                Background This paper investigated the connection between transactional leadership styles, contingent rewards, punishments, and employee performance while emphasizing employee engagement’s mediating role. Existing research has predominantly focused on isolated associations between contingent rewards, punishment, and employee performance, leaving gaps in the empirical exploration of these mediating mechanisms. To address this research gap, our study has introduced a conceptual framework to understand the multifaceted connection between contingent rewards, punishment, and their effects on employee performance, with a specific emphasis on the mediating function of employee engagement. Methods We involved 273 full-time non-clinical healthcare professionals employed in NABH-accredited hospitals in Jharkhand, India. A structured survey instrument was employed for data collection from the specific survey participants, with the investigation of the research hypotheses conducted through the application of partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Preliminary findings suggested that contingent rewards and punishment do not directly influence employee performance. Instead, our study highlighted the critical mediating role of employee engagement, particularly its dimensions of Vigor, absorption, and dedication. Conclusions This research has underscored rewards and punishments as essential tools for influencing employee behaviour, motivation, and performance. Employee engagement, as a multifaceted construct, not only benefits individual employees but also significantly impacts overall organizational performance and success.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1487/v1?src=rss">Effect of preoperative hair removal vs. no removal on surgical site infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The practice of preoperative hair removal has been debated regarding its role in Surgical Site Infection (SSI) prevention. This study aimed to compare the different hair removing modalities and investigate the effect of preoperative hair removal on SSI rates. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Three databases—PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library—were searched for relevant studies comparing preoperative hair removal to no hair removal. Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies reporting SSI rates. Odds ratios, mean differences, and p-values were analyzed using a random effect model. Results Seventeen studies involving 5,407 patients were included. No statistically significant difference in SSI rates was found between the hair removal and no removal groups (OR = 1.066, 95% CI 0.646–1.758, p = 0.803). When comparing clipping to no hair removal, there was no significant difference (OR = 0.967, 95% CI 0.642–1.455, p = 0.870). Razor shaving was associated with higher skin damage and slightly increased SSI risk compared to clipping but not statistically significant (OR = 0.749, 95% CI 0.346–1.623, p = 0.464). Depilatory creams, however, were favored over razor shaving (OR = 3.235, 95% CI 1.543–6.785, p = 0.002), as they were linked to less skin damage and easier application. Conclusion Preoperative hair removal does not significantly impact SSI rates. Clipping appears to be a safer alternative to shaving, while depilatory creams show promise as an effective, less damaging option.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1486/v1?src=rss">The Awareness of Dental Erosion and Its Causes and Protective Factors Among a General Adult Population of Trinidad and Tobago [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Given the worldwide prevalence of tooth wear and wear related to dental erosion a baseline understanding of the knowledge of populations related to erosive wear is required to maximize public health campaigns developed to address this condition. This research investigated the awareness of dental erosion, its causes, and protective factors among the general adult population of Trinidad and Tobago. Methods An anonymous de-novo questionnaire, developed using Google Forms and aligned with the CHERRIES framework for web-based surveys, was subjected to face validity to ensure the inclusion of content relevant to erosive tooth wear and clarity of items intended for a general population. The questionnaire was deployed on social media platforms (Facebook) and groups (WhatsApp Community Groups) specific to groups in Trinidad and Tobago for four months. Data was entered into SPSS (Version 29) and analyzed using cross-tabulations and Chi-squared tests. Results Of the 210 respondents, 39.2% had previously been diagnosed with tooth wear, 43.1 % believed they could identify erosive wear and 42.1% believed they could differentiate between predominantly erosive wear and dental caries. Sixty-two point nine percent of respondents identified sensitivity as a symptom of erosive tooth wear. Chi-squared tests on cross-tabulated data showed significant relationships between age and GERD causing erosive wear (p=0.03), heartburn causing erosive wear (p=0.049), eating disorders causing erosive wear (p=0.009), disorders with excessive vomiting causing erosive wear (p=0.005), excessive wine consumption (p=0.004). There were no significant statistical significances for cross-tabulated data on sex and the responses on causative factors. Conclusions Respondents were generally knowledgeable about the various types of foods, beverages, and medical conditions that may cause dental erosion but were unfamiliar with other factors that may influence erosion or protect against dental erosion.

                Background The objective of the research was to analyze e-mails exchanged at Enron, a power company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 following an investigation into unethical operations regarding their financials. Methods Like other researchers, we identify the “most important” employees and detect “communities” using network science methods. In addition, because previous work required that 10 e-mails be sent and received for an e-mail relationship to exist, we analyzed the effect of different “thresholds” on the results. We also performed sentiment analyses on the e-mails to evaluate whether sentiment changed over time. Results We find that the “importance” of a person depends on the centrality measure used; while the communities we detected resembled the formal organizational structure of the company. In addition, we found that centrality results were very dependent on the “threshold” used. Finally, analysis of email sentiment over time = do not give insight into the financial wellbeing of Enron. Conclusion Our results provide insight into how information flowed through Enron, who the key employees were, and e-mail sentiment before and after the crisis.

                Background The extension of hydatid liver cysts into the mediastinum through diaphragmatic hiatus is extremely rare. In this report, we describe a rare case of a hydatid liver cyst with mediastinal extension through Larrey’s hiatus, emphasizing the surgical strategy for successful treatment. In this report, we present the first documented case of a hydatid liver cyst extending into the mediastinum through Larrey’s hiatus. Case presentation We report the case of a 65-year-old male who presented with right-upper-quadrant and left-sided chest pain evolving for two months. Physical examination showed dullnes in the epigastric region. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan, revealed a 13 cm mediastino-abdominal hydatid cyst, centered on the left liver lobe with extension into the mediastinum through the Larray’s diaphragmatic hiatus. The patient underwent surgical management. Both thoracic and visceral surgeons were involved. The surgical management involved both thoracic and visceral surgeons. A Makuuchi incision allowed resection of the hydatid liver cyst. The mediastinal portion of the cyst, resting on the pericardium was aspirated through Larrey’s hiatus, followed by irrigation with a scolicidal solution. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion Transmediastinal hydatid liver cysts are rare and should be operated on in close collaboration between visceral and thoracic surgeons to prevent complications.

                The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic were a global challenge, and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of virus RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs has become a common tool to confirm the clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. Available evidence suggests, that Whatman™ Flinders Technology Associates™ (FTA) cards are a reliable option for the safe transport and storage of viral RNA pathogens. In 2021 FTA cards were shown to be suitable for the stable preservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA derived from nasopharyngeal swabs even at elevated storage temperatures. Subsequently, another study identified Whatman filter paper to be a cheaper alternative with respect to the stable storage SARS-CoV-2 RNA at room temperature. This correspondence is meant to discuss the performance of both FTA cards and filter paper also scrutinizing performance calculations and respective evaluations.
