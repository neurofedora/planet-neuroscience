	<p>In youths, callous–unemotional (CU) traits and conduct problems (CP) are independently associated with bullying perpetration and these effects are also observed when controlling for sex. Moreover, research indicates that the co-existence of high levels of both CU and CP further increase the risk. Although several studies have examined the relationship between CU traits and traditional bullying, few have also included a measure of cyberbullying and very few of them have focused the early adolescence. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend these findings in a large sample of Italian early adolescents considering both traditional and cyberbullying behaviors. Data were extracted from the Bullying and Youth Mental Health Naples study (BYMHNS) which included 2959 students of 10–15 years of age. CP, CU traits, traditional bullying behaviors, and cyberbullying behaviors were assessed by multi-item self-report scales. As expected, we replicated the significant and specific association between CU traits and traditional bullying, extending the findings to cyberbullying. In addition, in the latter case the effect was moderated by CP. The theoretical and clinical implications of these results were discussed.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ in situ hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that it may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Brain-wide neural dynamics of poststroke recovery induced by optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Poststroke optogenetic stimulations can promote functional recovery. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying recovery remain unclear. Elucidating key neural circuits involved in recovery will be invaluable for translating neuromodulation strategies after stroke. Here, we used optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain-wide neural circuit dynamics after stroke in mice treated with and without optogenetic excitatory neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1). We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth&ndash;associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin<sup>+</sup>/channelrhodopsin<sup>+</sup> presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery. Together, these findings suggest early involvement of corticothalamic circuit as an important mediator of poststroke recovery.</p>

                <p>Solid-state systems can host a variety of thermodynamic phases that can be controlled with magnetic fields, strain, or laser excitation. Many phases that are believed to exhibit exotic properties only exist on the nanoscale, coexisting with other phases that make them challenging to study, as measurements require both nanometer spatial resolution and spectroscopic information, which are not easily accessible with traditional x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques. Here, we use coherent diffractive imaging spectroscopy (CDIS) to acquire quantitative hyperspectral images of the prototypical quantum material vanadium oxide across the vanadium <I>L</I><SUB>2,3</SUB> and oxygen <I>K</I> x-ray absorption edges with nanometer-scale resolution. We extract the full complex refractive indices of the monoclinic insulating and rutile conducting phases of VO<SUB>2</SUB> from a single sample and find no evidence for correlation-driven phase transitions. CDIS will enable quantitative full-field x-ray spectromicroscopy for studying phase separation in time-resolved experiments and other extreme sample environments where other methods cannot operate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Single-molecule measurements reveal that PARP1 condenses DNA by loop stabilization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that plays important roles in DNA repair, chromatin organization and transcription regulation. Although binding and activation of PARP1 by DNA damage sites has been extensively studied, little is known about how PARP1 binds to long stretches of undamaged DNA and how it could shape chromatin architecture. Here, using single-molecule techniques, we show that PARP1 binds and condenses undamaged, kilobase-length DNA subject to sub-piconewton mechanical forces. Stepwise decondensation at high force and DNA braiding experiments show that the condensation activity is due to the stabilization of DNA loops by PARP1. PARP inhibitors do not affect the level of condensation of undamaged DNA but act to block condensation reversal for damaged DNA in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Our findings suggest a mechanism for PARP1 in the organization of chromatin structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Efficient derivation of human trophoblast stem cells from primed pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) provide a valuable model to study placental development and function. While primary hTSCs have been derived from embryos/early placenta, and transdifferentiated hTSCs from nai&#x0308;ve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), the generation of hTSCs from primed PSCs is problematic. We report the successful generation of TSCs from primed hPSCs and show that BMP4 substantially enhances this process. TSCs derived from primed hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs in terms of morphology, proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression. We define the chromatin accessibility dynamics and histone modifications (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) that specify hPSC-derived TSCs. Consistent with low density of H3K27me3 in primed hPSC-derived hTSCs, we show that knockout of H3K27 methyltransferases (EZH1/2) increases the efficiency of hTSC derivation from primed hPSCs. Efficient derivation of hTSCs from primed hPSCs provides a simple and powerful model to understand human trophoblast development, including the pathogenesis of trophoblast-related disorders, by generating disease-specific hTSCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A general model for the demographic signatures of the transition from pandemic emergence to endemicity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anticipating the medium- and long-term trajectory of pathogen emergence has acquired new urgency given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For many human pathogens, the burden of disease depends on age and previous exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing, and immunity to establish a plausible range for future age incidence and mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism across a range of immunity durations and relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured mixing to bound expectations for changing age incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailor mitigation strategies in countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Room temperature crack-healing in an atomically layered ternary carbide</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ceramic materials provide outstanding chemical and structural stability at high temperatures and in hostile environments but are susceptible to catastrophic fracture that severely limits their applicability. Traditional approaches to partially overcome this limitation rely on activating toughening mechanisms during crack growth to postpone fracture. Here, we demonstrate a more potent toughening mechanism that involves an intriguing possibility of healing the cracks as they form, even at room temperature, in an atomically layered ternary carbide. Crystals of this class of ceramic materials readily fracture along weakly bonded crystallographic planes. However, the onset of an abstruse mode of deformation, referred to as kinking in these materials, induces large crystallographic rotations and plastic deformation that physically heal the cracks. This implies that the toughness of numerous other layered ceramic materials, whose broader applications have been limited by their susceptibility to catastrophic fracture, can also be enhanced by microstructural engineering to promote kinking and crack-healing.</p>

                <p>Stochastic resonance, where noise synchronizes a system&rsquo;s response to an external drive, is a wide-reaching phenomenon found in noisy systems spanning from the dynamics of neurons to the periodicity of ice ages. Quantum tunneling can extend stochastic resonance to the quantum realm. We demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance for magnetic transitions in atoms by inelastic electron tunneling with a scanning tunneling microscope. Stochastic resonance is shown deep in the quantum regime, where spin-state fluctuations are driven by tunneling of the magnetization, and in a semiclassical crossover region, where thermally excited electrons drive transitions between ground and excited states. Inducing synchronization by periodically modulating transition rates provides a general mechanism to determine real-time spin dynamics ranging from milliseconds to picoseconds.</p>

These findings challenge claims that people have an innate left-to-right mapping of numbers and that these mappings arise from a domain-general magnitude system. Rather, the direction-specific mappings found in industrialized cultures may originate from direction-agnostic mappings that reflect the correlational structure of the natural world.</p>

                <p>Orbital angular momentum of light is a core feature in photonics. Its confinement to surfaces using plasmonics has unlocked many phenomena and potential applications. Here, we introduce the reflection from structural boundaries as a new degree of freedom to generate and control plasmonic orbital angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrate plasmonic vortex cavities, generating a succession of vortex pulses with increasing topological charge as a function of time. We track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these angularly decelerating plasmon pulse train within the cavities for over 300 femtoseconds using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, showing that the angular momentum grows by multiples of the chiral order of the cavity. The introduction of this degree of freedom to tame orbital angular momentum delivered by plasmonic vortices could miniaturize pump probe&ndash;like quantum initialization schemes, increase the torque exerted by plasmonic tweezers, and potentially achieve vortex lattice cavities with dynamically evolving topology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Protein detection in blood with single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to characterize individual biomarker protein molecules in patient blood samples could enable diagnosis of diseases at an earlier stage, when treatment is typically more effective. Single-molecule imaging offers a promising approach to accomplish this goal. However, thus far, single-molecule imaging methods have not been translated into the clinical setting. The detection limit of these methods has been confined to the picomolar (10<sup>&ndash;12</sup> M) range, several orders of magnitude higher than the circulating concentrations of biomarker proteins present in many diseases. Here, we describe single-molecule augmented capture (SMAC), a single-molecule imaging technique to quantify and characterize individual protein molecules of interest down to the subfemtomolar (&lt;10<sup>&ndash;15</sup> M) range. We demonstrate SMAC in a variety of applications with human blood samples, including the analysis of disease-associated secreted proteins, membrane proteins, and rare intracellular proteins. SMAC opens the door to the application of single-molecule imaging in noninvasive disease profiling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Asymmetry of extreme Cenozoic climate-carbon cycle events</a></h4>

              
                <p>The history of Earth&rsquo;s climate and carbon cycle is preserved in deep-sea foraminiferal carbon and oxygen isotope records. Here, we show that the sub-million-year fluctuations in both records have exhibited negatively skewed non-Gaussian tails throughout much of the Cenozoic era (66 Ma to present), suggesting an intrinsic asymmetry that favors "hyperthermal-like" extreme events of abrupt global warming and oxidation of organic carbon. We show that this asymmetry is quantitatively consistent with a general mechanism of self-amplification that can be modeled using stochastic multiplicative noise. A numerical climate&ndash;carbon cycle model in which the amplitude of random biogeochemical fluctuations increases at higher temperatures reproduces the data well and can further explain the apparent pacing of past extreme warming events by changes in orbital parameters. Our results also suggest that, as anthropogenic warming continues, Earth&rsquo;s climate may become more susceptible to extreme warming events on time scales of tens of thousands of years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Multiple memory formation in glassy landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cyclically sheared jammed packings form memories of the shear amplitude at which they were trained by falling into periodic orbits where each particle returns to the identical position in subsequent cycles. While simple models that treat clusters of rearranging particles as isolated two-state systems offer insight into this memory formation, they fail to account for the long training times and multiperiod orbits observed in simulated sheared packings. We show that adding interactions between rearranging clusters overcomes these deficiencies. In addition, interactions allow simultaneous encoding of multiple memories, which would not have been possible otherwise. These memories are different in an essential way from those found in other systems, such as multiple transient memories observed in sheared suspensions, and contain information about the strength of the interactions.</p>

                <p>When an amorphous solid is deformed cyclically, it may reach a steady state in which the paths of constituent particles trace out closed loops that repeat in each driving cycle. A remarkable variant has been noticed in simulations where the period of particle motions is a multiple of the period of driving, but the reasons for this behavior have remained unclear. Motivated by mesoscopic features of displacement fields in experiments on jammed solids, we propose and analyze a simple model of interacting soft spots&mdash;locations where particles rearrange under stress and that resemble two-level systems with hysteresis. We show that multiperiodic behavior can arise among just three or more soft spots that interact with each other, but in all cases it requires frustrated interactions, illuminating this otherwise elusive type of interaction. We suggest directions for seeking this signature of frustration in experiments and for achieving it in designed systems.</p>

                <p>Cell pluripotency is fundamental to biology. It has long been known that differentiated somatic plant cells may reacquire pluripotency, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.</p>

                <p>Despite the development of next-generation antiandrogens, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable. Here, we describe a unique semisynthetic bispecific antibody that uses site-specific unnatural amino acid conjugation to combine the potency of a T cell&ndash;recruiting anti-CD3 antibody with the specificity of an imaging ligand (DUPA) for prostate-specific membrane antigen. This format enabled optimization of structure and function to produce a candidate (CCW702) with specific, potent in vitro cytotoxicity and improved stability compared with a bispecific single-chain variable fragment format. In vivo, CCW702 eliminated C4-2 xenografts with as few as three weekly subcutaneous doses and prevented growth of PCSD1 patient-derived xenograft tumors in mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, CCW702 was well tolerated up to 34.1 mg/kg per dose, with near-complete subcutaneous bioavailability and a PK profile supporting testing of a weekly dosing regimen in patients. CCW702 is being evaluated in a first in-human clinical trial for men with mCRPC who had progressed on prior therapies (NCT04077021).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cocaine addiction is a devastating public health epidemic that continues to grow. Studies focused on identifying biological factors influencing cocaine craving and relapse vulnerability are necessary to promote abstinence in recovering drug users. Sex and ovarian hormones are known to influence cocaine addiction liability and relapse vulnerability in both humans and rodents. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in the time-dependent intensification or "incubation" of cue-induced cocaine craving that occurs during withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration and have identified changes across the rat reproductive cycle (estrous cycle). Female rats in the estrus stage of the cycle (Estrus Females), the phase during which ovulation occurs, show an increase in the magnitude of incubated cue-induced cocaine craving compared with females in all other phases of the estrous cycle (Non-Estrus Females). Here we extend these findings by assessing incubated craving across the estrous cycle during earlier withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 1 and 15) and later withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 48). We found that this increase in the magnitude of incubated craving during estrus (Estrus Females) is present on withdrawal day 15, but not on withdrawal day 1, and further increases by withdrawal day 48. No difference in the magnitude of incubated craving was observed between Males and Non-Estrus Females. Our data indicate that the effects of hormonal fluctuations on cue-induced cocaine craving intensify during the first month and a half of withdrawal, showing an interaction among abstinence length, estrous cycle fluctuations, and cocaine craving.</p>

                <p>Increased mTOR activity has been shown to enhance regeneration of injured axons by increasing neuronal protein synthesis, while PTEN signaling can block mTOR activity to attenuate protein synthesis. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in regulation of PTEN and mTOR expression, and previous work in spinal cord showed an increase in miR-199a-3p after spinal cord injury (SCI) and increase in miR-21 in SCI animals that had undergone exercise. Pten mRNA is a target for miR-21 and miR-199a-3p is predicted to target mTor mRNA. Here, we show that miR-21 and miR-199a-3p are expressed in adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we used culture preparations to test functions of the rat miRs in adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons. miR-21 increases and miR-199a-3p decreases in DRG neurons after in vivo axotomy. In both the adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons, miR-21 promotes and miR-199a-3p attenuates neurite growth. miR-21 directly bound to Pten mRNA and miR-21 overexpression decreased Pten mRNA levels. Conversely, miR-199a-3p directly bound to mTor mRNA and miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased mTor mRNA levels. Overexpressing miR-21 increased both overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis in cultured DRGs, while miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased this protein synthesis. The axon growth phenotypes seen with miR-21 and miR-199a-3p overexpression were reversed by co-transfecting PTEN and mTOR cDNA expression constructs with the predicted 3' untranslated region (UTR) miR target sequences deleted. Taken together, these studies indicate that injury-induced alterations in miR-21 and miR-199a-3p expression can alter axon growth capacity by changing overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis through regulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Nicotine is an addictive substance historically consumed through smoking and more recently through the use of electronic vapor devices. The increasing prevalence and popularity of vaping prompts the need for preclinical rodent models of nicotine vapor exposure and an improved understanding of the impact of vaping on specific brain regions, bodily functions, and behaviors. We used a rodent model of electronic nicotine vapor exposure to examine the cellular and behavioral consequences of acute and repeated vapor exposure. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a single 3-h session (acute exposure) or five daily sessions (repeated exposure) of intermittent vapes of 120 mg/ml nicotine in propylene glycol:vegetable glycerol (PG/VG) or PG/VG control. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure did not alter body weight, and both exposure paradigms produced pharmacologically significant serum nicotine and cotinine levels in the 120 mg/ml nicotine group compared with PG/VG controls. Acute exposure to electronic nicotine vapor increased central amygdala (CeA) activity in individual neuronal firing and in expression of the molecular activity marker, cFos. The changes in neuronal activity following acute exposure were not observed following repeated exposure. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure decreased core body temperature, however acute exposure decreased locomotion while repeated exposure increased locomotion. Collectively, these studies provide validation of a mouse model of nicotine vapor exposure and important evidence for how exposure to electronic nicotine vapor produces differential effects on CeA neuronal activity and on specific body functions and behaviors like thermoregulation and locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Implicit Visuomotor Adaptation Remains Limited after Several Days of Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks has been viewed as an implicit learning phenomenon. The implicit process affords recalibration of existing motor skills so that the system can adjust to changes in the body or environment without relearning from scratch. However, recent findings suggest that the implicit process is heavily constrained, calling into question its utility in motor learning and the theoretical framework of sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. These inferences have been based mainly on results from single bouts of training, where explicit compensation strategies, such as explicitly re-aiming the intended movement direction, contribute a significant proportion of adaptive learning. It is possible, however, that the implicit process supersedes explicit compensation strategies over repeated practice sessions. We tested this by dissociating the contributions of explicit re-aiming strategies and the implicit process in human participants over five consecutive days of training. Despite a substantially longer duration of training, the implicit process still plateaued at a value far short of complete learning and, as has been observed in previous studies, was inappropriate for a mirror-reversal task. Notably, we find significant between subject differences that call into question traditional interpretation of these group-level results.</p>

<p>Mutations in the X-linked cell adhesion protein PCDH19 lead to seizures, cognitive impairment, and other behavioral comorbidities when present in a mosaic pattern. Neither the molecular mechanisms underpinning this disorder nor the function of PCDH19 itself are well understood. By combining RNA <I>in situ</I> hybridization with immunohistochemistry and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we reveal <I>Pcdh19</I> expression in cortical interneurons and provide a first account of the subtypes of neurons expressing <I>Pcdh19</I>/<I>PCDH19</I>, both in the mouse and the human cortex. Our quantitative analysis of the <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mouse exposes subtle changes in cortical layer composition, with no major alterations of the main axonal tracts. In addition, <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant animals, particularly females, display preweaning behavioral changes, including reduced anxiety and increased exploratory behavior. Importantly, our experiments also reveal an effect of the social environment on the behavior of wild-type littermates of <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mice, which show alterations when compared with wild-type animals not housed with mutants.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of neurons to produce behaviorally relevant activity in the absence of pathology relies on the fine balance of synaptic inhibition to excitation. In the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit, this balance is maintained by a diverse population of inhibitory interneurons that receive largely similar glutamatergic afferents as their target pyramidal cells, with EPSCs generated by both AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In this study, we take advantage of a recently generated GluN2A-null rat model to assess the contribution of GluN2A subunits to glutamatergic synaptic currents in three subclasses of interneuron found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. For both parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive interneurons, the GluN2A subunit is expressed at glutamatergic synapses and contributes to the EPSC. In contrast, in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons, the contribution of GluN2A to the EPSC is negligible. Furthermore, synaptic potentiation at glutamatergic synapses on CCK-positive interneurons does not require the activation of GluN2A-containing NMDARs but does rely on the activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B and GluN2D subunits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The HexMaze: A Previous Knowledge Task on Map Learning for Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>New information is rarely learned in isolation; instead, most of what we experience can be incorporated into or uses previous knowledge networks in some form. Previous knowledge in form of a cognitive map can facilitate knowledge acquisition and will influence how we learn new spatial information. Here, we developed a new spatial navigation task where food locations are learned in a large, gangway maze to test how mice learn a large spatial map over a longer time period&mdash;the HexMaze. Analyzing performance across sessions as well as on specific trials, we can show simple memory effects as well as multiple effects of previous knowledge of the map accelerating both online learning and performance increases over offline periods when incorporating new information. We could identify the following three main phases: (1) learning the initial goal location; (2) faster learning after 2 weeks when learning a new goal location; and then (3) the ability to express one-session learning, leading to long-term memory effect after 12 weeks. Importantly, we are the first to show that buildup of a spatial map is dependent on how much time passes, not how often the animal is trained.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of miR-183/96 Alters Synaptic Strength via Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Mechanisms at a Central Synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>A point mutation in miR-96 causes non-syndromic progressive peripheral hearing loss and alters structure and physiology of the central auditory system. To gain further insight into the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) within the central auditory system, we investigated constitutive <I>Mir-183/96<sup>dko</sup></I> mice of both sexes. In this mouse model, the genomically clustered miR-183 and miR-96 are constitutively deleted. It shows significantly and specifically reduced volumes of auditory hindbrain nuclei, because of decreases in cell number and soma size. Electrophysiological analysis of the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) demonstrated strongly altered synaptic transmission in young-adult mice. We observed an increase in quantal content and readily releasable vesicle pool size in the presynapse while the overall morphology of the calyx was unchanged. Detailed analysis of the active zones (AZs) revealed differences in its molecular composition and synaptic vesicle (SV) distribution. Postsynaptically, altered clustering and increased synaptic abundancy of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 was observed resulting in an increase in quantal amplitude. Together, these presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations led to a 2-fold increase of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in MNTB neurons. None of these changes were observed in deaf <I>Cldn14</I><sup>ko</sup> mice, confirming an on-site role of miR-183 and miR-96 in the auditory hindbrain. Our data suggest that the <I>Mir-183/96</I> cluster plays a key role for proper synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held and for the development of the auditory hindbrain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The calyx of Held is the outstanding model system to study basic synaptic physiology. Yet, genetic factors driving its morphologic and functional maturation are largely unknown. Here, we identify the <I>Mir-183/96</I> cluster as an important factor to regulate its synaptic strength. Presynaptically, <I>Mir-183/96<sup>dko</sup></I> calyces show an increase in release-ready synaptic vesicles (SVs), quantal content and abundance of the proteins Bassoon and Piccolo. Postsynaptically, the quantal size as well as number and size of GluA1 puncta were increased. The two microRNAs (miRNAs) are thus attractive candidates for regulation of synaptic maturation and long-term adaptations to sound levels. Moreover, the different phenotypic outcomes of different types of mutations in the <I>Mir-183</I> cluster corroborate the requirement of mutation-tailored therapies in patients with hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Contributions to Cochlear Outer Hair Cell Ca2+ Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>For normal cochlear function, outer hair cells (OHCs) require a precise control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In the absence of regulatory elements such as proteinaceous buffers or extrusion pumps, OHCs degenerate, leading to profound hearing impairment. Influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs both at the stereocilia tips and the basolateral membrane. In this latter compartment, two different origins for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx have been poorly explored: voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at synapses with Type II afferent neurons, and &alpha;9&alpha;10 cholinergic nicotinic receptors at synapses with medio-olivochlear complex (MOC) neurons. Using functional imaging in mouse OHCs, we dissected Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx individually through each of these sources, either by applying step depolarizations to activate VGCC, or stimulating MOC axons. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions originated in MOC synapses, but not by VGCC activation, was confined by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases most likely present in nearby synaptic cisterns. Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in OHCs are small, VGCC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were comparable in size to those elicited by &alpha;9&alpha;10 receptors, and were potentiated by ryanodine receptors (RyRs). In contrast, no evidence of potentiation by RyRs was found for MOC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals over a wide range of presynaptic stimulation strengths. Our study shows that despite the fact that these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites are closely positioned, they differ in their regulation by intracellular cisterns and/or organelles, suggesting the existence of well-tuned mechanisms to separate the two different OHC synaptic functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Outer hair cells (OHCs) are sensory cells in the inner ear operating under very special constraints. Acoustic stimulation leads to fast changes both in membrane potential and in the intracellular concentration of metabolites such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Tight mechanisms for Ca<sup>2+</sup> control in OHCs have been reported. Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is crucial for two important synaptic processes: inhibition by efferent cholinergic neurons, and glutamate release onto Type II afferent fibers. In the current study we functionally imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> at these two different synapses, showing close positioning within the basolateral compartment of OHCs. In addition, we show differential regulation of these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources by synaptic cisterns and/or organelles, which could result crucial for functional segregation during normal hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Early Cortical Progenitor-Specific Mechanism Regulates Thalamocortical Innervation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cortical subplate is critical in regulating the entry of thalamocortical sensory afferents into the cortex. These afferents reach the subplate at embryonic day (E)15.5 in the mouse, but "wait" for several days, entering the cortical plate postnatally. We report that when transcription factor LHX2 is lost in E11.5 cortical progenitors, which give rise to subplate neurons, thalamocortical afferents display premature, exuberant ingrowth into the E15.5 cortex. Embryonic mutant subplate neurons are correctly positioned below the cortical plate, but they display an altered transcriptome and immature electrophysiological properties during the waiting period. The sensory thalamus in these cortex-specific <I>Lhx2</I> mutants displays atrophy and by postnatal day (P) 7, sensory innervation to the cortex is nearly eliminated leading to a loss of the somatosensory barrels. Strikingly, these phenotypes do not manifest if LHX2 is lost in postmitotic subplate neurons, and the transcriptomic dysregulation in the subplate resulting from postmitotic loss of LHX2 is vastly distinct from that seen when LHX2 is lost in progenitors. These results demonstrate a mechanism operating in subplate progenitors that has profound consequences on the growth of thalamocortical axons into the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Thalamocortical nerves carry sensory information from the periphery to the cortex. When they first grow into the embryonic cortex, they "wait" at the subplate, a structure critical for the guidance and eventual connectivity of thalamic axons with their cortical targets. How the properties of subplate neurons are regulated is unclear. We report that transcription factor LHX2 is required in the progenitor "mother" cells of the cortical primordium when they are producing their "daughter" subplate neurons, in order for the thalamocortical pathway to wait at the subplate. Without LHX2 function in subplate progenitors, thalamocortical axons grow past the subplate, entering the cortical plate prematurely. This is followed by their eventual attrition and, consequently, a profound loss of sensory innervation of the mature cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Smad2 in Adult Neuroplasticity as Seen through Hippocampal-Dependent Spatial Learning/Memory and Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adult neural plasticity is an important and intriguing phenomenon in the brain, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis is directly involved in modulating neural plasticity by mechanisms that are only partially understood. We have performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to study Smad2, a transcription factor selected from genes that are demethylated after exercise through the analysis of an array of physical activity-induced factors, and their corresponding gene expression, and an efficient inducer of plasticity. In these studies, changes in cell number and morphology were analyzed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (cell proliferation and survival, including regional distribution, and structural maturation/differentiation, including arborization, dendritic spines, and neurotransmitter-specific vesicles) of sedentary male mice, after evaluation in a battery of behavioral tests. As a result, we reveal a role for Smad2 in the balance of proliferation versus maturation of differentiating immature cells (Smad2 silencing increases both the proliferation and survival of cycling cells in the dentate granule cell layer), and in the plasticity of both newborn and mature neurons in mice (by decreasing dendritic arborization and dendritic spine number). Moreover, Smad2 silencing specifically compromises spatial learning in mice (through impairments of spatial tasks acquisition both in long-term learning and working memory). These data suggest that Smad2 participates in adult neural plasticity by influencing the proliferation and maturation of dentate gyrus neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Smad2 is one of the main components of the transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) pathway. The commitment of cell fate in the nervous system is tightly coordinated by SMAD2 signaling, as are further differentiation steps (e.g., dendrite and axon growth, myelination, and synapse formation). However, there are no studies that have directly evaluated the role of <I>Smad2</I> gene in hippocampus of adult animals. Modulation of these parameters in the adult hippocampus can affect hippocampal-dependent behaviors, which may shed light on the mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis and behavior. We demonstrate here a role for Smad2 in the maturation of differentiating immature cells and in the plasticity of mature neurons. Moreover, Smad2 silencing specifically compromises the spatial learning abilities of adult male mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multifaceted Functions of Rab23 on Primary Cilium-Mediated and Hedgehog Signaling-Mediated Cerebellar Granule Cell Proliferation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling from the primary cilium drives cerebellar granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation. Mutations of hedgehog (Hh) pathway repressors commonly cause medulloblastoma, the most prevalent and malignant childhood brain tumor that arises from aberrant GCP proliferation. We demonstrate that Nestin Cre-driven conditional knock-out (CKO) of a Shh pathway repressor-<I>Rab23</I> in the mouse brain of both genders caused mis-patterning of cerebellar folia and elevated GCP proliferation during early development, but with no prevalent occurrence of medulloblastoma at adult stage. Strikingly, <I>Rab23-</I>depleted GCPs exhibited upregulated basal level of Shh pathway activities despite showing an abnormal ciliogenesis of primary cilia. In line with the compromised ciliation, <I>Rab23-</I>depleted GCPs were desensitized against Hh pathway activity stimulations by Shh ligand and Smoothened (Smo) agonist-SAG, and exhibited attenuated stimulation of Smo-localization on the primary cilium in response to SAG. These results implicate multidimensional actions of Rab23 on Hh signaling cascade. Rab23 represses the basal level of Shh signaling, while facilitating primary cilium-dependent extrinsic Shh signaling activation. Collectively, our findings unravel instrumental roles of <I>Rab23</I> in GCP proliferation and ciliogenesis. Furthermore, <I>Rab23</I>'s potentiation of Shh signaling pathway through the primary cilium and Smo suggests a potential new therapeutic strategy for Smo/primary cilium-driven medulloblastoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary cilium and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling are known to regulate granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation. Aberrant overactivation of Shh signaling pathway ectopically increases GCP proliferation and causes malignant childhood tumor called medulloblastoma. However, the genetic and molecular regulatory cascade of GCP tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Our finding uncovers Rab23 as a novel regulator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway activity and cell proliferation in GCP. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that Rab23 confers dual functions in regulating Shh signaling; it potentiates primary cilium and Shh/Smoothened (Smo)-dependent signaling activation, while antagonizes basal level Hh activity. Our data present a previously underappreciated aspect of Rab23 in mediating extrinsic Shh signaling upstream of Smo. This study sheds new light on the mechanistic insights underpinning Shh signaling-mediated GCP proliferation and tumorigenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Neural Microstates in the VTA-Striatal-Prefrontal Loop during Novelty Exploration in the Rat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural activity at the large-scale population level has been suggested to be consistent with a sequence of brief, quasistable spatial patterns. These "microstates" and their temporal dynamics have been linked to myriad cognitive functions and brain diseases. Most of this research has been performed using EEG, leaving many questions, such as the existence, dynamics, and behavioral relevance of microstates at the level of local field potentials (LFPs), unaddressed. Here, we adapted the standard EEG microstate analysis to triple-area LFP recordings from 192 electrodes in rats to investigate the mesoscopic dynamics of neural microstates within and across brain regions during novelty exploration. We performed simultaneous recordings from the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area in male rats during awake behavior (object novelty and exploration). We found that the LFP data can be accounted for by multiple, recurring microstates that were stable for ~60&ndash;100 ms. The simultaneous microstate activity across brain regions revealed rhythmic patterns of coactivations, which we interpret as a novel indicator of inter-regional, mesoscale synchronization. Furthermore, these rhythmic coactivation patterns across microstates were modulated by behavioral states such as movement and exploration of a novel object. These results support the existence of a functional mesoscopic organization across multiple brain areas and present a possible link of the origin of macroscopic EEG microstates to zero-lag neuronal synchronization within and between brain areas, which is of particular interest to the human research community.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The coordination of neural activity across the entire brain has remained elusive. Here we combine large-scale neural recordings at fine spatial resolution with the analysis of microstates (i.e., short-lived, recurring spatial patterns of neural activity). We demonstrate that the local activity in different brain areas can be accounted for by only a few microstates per region. These microstates exhibited temporal dynamics that were correlated across regions in rhythmic patterns. We demonstrate that these microstates are linked to behavior and exhibit different properties in the frequency domain during different behavioral states. In summary, LFP microstates provide an insightful approach to studying both mesoscopic and large-scale brain activation within and across regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synergistic Organization of Neural Inputs from Spinal Motor Neurons to Extrinsic and Intrinsic Hand Muscles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our current understanding of synergistic muscle control is based on the analysis of muscle activities. Modules (synergies) in muscle coordination are extracted from electromyographic (EMG) signal envelopes. Each envelope indirectly reflects the neural drive received by a muscle; therefore, it carries information on the overall activity of the innervating motor neurons. However, it is not known whether the output of spinal motor neurons, whose number is orders of magnitude greater than the muscles they innervate, is organized in a low-dimensional fashion when performing complex tasks. Here, we hypothesized that motor neuron activities exhibit a synergistic organization in complex tasks and therefore that the common input to motor neurons results in a large dimensionality reduction in motor neuron outputs. To test this hypothesis, we factorized the output spike trains of motor neurons innervating 14 intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles and analyzed the dimensionality of control when healthy individuals exerted isometric forces using seven grip types. We identified four motor neuron synergies, accounting for &gt;70% of the variance of the activity of 54.1 &plusmn; 12.9 motor neurons, and we identified four functionally similar muscle synergies. However, motor neuron synergies better discriminated individual finger forces than muscle synergies and were more consistent with the expected role of muscles actuating each finger. Moreover, in a few cases, motor neurons innervating the same muscle were active in separate synergies. Our findings suggest a highly divergent net neural inputs to spinal motor neurons from spinal and supraspinal structures, contributing to the dimensionality reduction captured by muscle synergies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We addressed whether the output of spinal motor neurons innervating multiple hand muscles could be accounted for by a modular organization, i.e., synergies, previously described to account for the coordination of multiple muscles. We found that motor neuron synergies presented similar dimensionality (implying a &gt;10-fold reduction in dimensionality) and structure as muscle synergies. Nonetheless, the synergistic behavior of subsets of motor neurons within a muscle was also observed. These results advance our understanding of how neuromuscular control arises from mapping descending inputs to muscle activation signals. We provide, for the first time, insights into the organization of neural inputs to spinal motor neurons which, to date, has been inferred through analysis of muscle synergies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Inference Gates Corticostriatal Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attributing outcomes to your own actions or to external causes is essential for appropriately learning which actions lead to reward and which actions do not. Our previous work showed that this type of credit assignment is best explained by a Bayesian reinforcement learning model which posits that beliefs about the causal structure of the environment modulate reward prediction errors (RPEs) during action value updating. In this study, we investigated the brain networks underlying reinforcement learning that are influenced by causal beliefs using functional magnetic resonance imaging while human participants (<I>n</I> = 31; 13 males, 18 females) completed a behavioral task that manipulated beliefs about causal structure. We found evidence that RPEs modulated by causal beliefs are represented in dorsal striatum, while standard (unmodulated) RPEs are represented in ventral striatum. Further analyses revealed that beliefs about causal structure are represented in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, structural equation modeling revealed effective connectivity from anterior insula to dorsal striatum. Together, these results are consistent with a possible neural architecture in which causal beliefs in anterior insula are integrated with prediction error signals in dorsal striatum to update action values.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning which actions lead to reward&mdash;a process known as reinforcement learning&mdash;is essential for survival. Inferring the causes of observed outcomes&mdash;a process known as causal inference&mdash;is crucial for appropriately assigning credit to one's own actions and restricting learning to effective action&ndash;outcome contingencies. Previous studies have linked reinforcement learning to the striatum, and causal inference to prefrontal regions, yet how these neural processes interact to guide adaptive behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we found evidence that causal beliefs represented in the prefrontal cortex modulate action value updating in posterior striatum, separately from the unmodulated action value update in ventral striatum posited by standard reinforcement learning models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory Coding of Limb Kinematics in Motor Cortex across a Key Developmental Transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primary motor cortex (M1) undergoes protracted development in mammals, functioning initially as a sensory structure. Throughout the first postnatal week in rats, M1 is strongly activated by self-generated forelimb movements&mdash;especially by the twitches that occur during active sleep. Here, we quantify the kinematic features of forelimb movements to reveal receptive-field properties of individual units within the forelimb region of M1. At postnatal day 8 (P8), nearly all units were strongly modulated by movement amplitude, especially during active sleep. By P12, only a minority of units continued to exhibit amplitude tuning, regardless of behavioral state. At both ages, movement direction also modulated M1 activity, though to a lesser extent. Finally, at P12, M1 population-level activity became more sparse and decorrelated, along with a substantial alteration in the statistical distribution of M1 responses to limb movements. These findings reveal a transition toward a more complex and informationally rich representation of movement long before M1 develops its motor functionality.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary motor cortex (M1) plays a fundamental role in the generation of voluntary movements and motor learning in adults. In early development, however, M1 functions as a prototypical sensory structure. Here, we demonstrate in infant rats that M1 codes for the kinematics of self-generated limb movements long before M1 develops its capacity to drive movements themselves. Moreover, we identify a key transition during the second postnatal week in which M1 activity becomes more informationally complex. Together, these findings further delineate the complex developmental path by which M1 develops its sensory functions in support of its later-emerging motor capacities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Neural Computations Support Spoken Word Recognition: Evidence from MEG and Competitor Priming</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human listeners achieve quick and effortless speech comprehension through computations of conditional probability using Bayes rule. However, the neural implementation of Bayesian perceptual inference remains unclear. Competitive-selection accounts (e.g., TRACE) propose that word recognition is achieved through direct inhibitory connections between units representing candidate words that share segments (e.g., <I>hygiene</I> and <I>hijack</I> share /haid/). Manipulations that increase lexical uncertainty should increase neural responses associated with word recognition when words cannot be uniquely identified. In contrast, predictive-selection accounts (e.g., Predictive-Coding) propose that spoken word recognition involves comparing heard and predicted speech sounds and using prediction error to update lexical representations. Increased lexical uncertainty in words, such as <I>hygiene</I> and <I>hijack</I>, will increase prediction error and hence neural activity only at later time points when different segments are predicted. We collected MEG data from male and female listeners to test these two Bayesian mechanisms and used a competitor priming manipulation to change the prior probability of specific words. Lexical decision responses showed delayed recognition of target words (<I>hygiene</I>) following presentation of a neighboring prime word (<I>hijack</I>) several minutes earlier. However, this effect was not observed with pseudoword primes (<I>higent</I>) or targets (<I>hijure</I>). Crucially, MEG responses in the STG showed greater neural responses for word-primed words after the point at which they were uniquely identified (after /haid/ in <I>hygiene</I>) but not before while similar changes were again absent for pseudowords. These findings are consistent with accounts of spoken word recognition in which neural computations of prediction error play a central role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Effective speech perception is critical to daily life and involves computations that combine speech signals with prior knowledge of spoken words (i.e., Bayesian perceptual inference). This study specifies the neural mechanisms that support spoken word recognition by testing two distinct implementations of Bayes perceptual inference. Most established theories propose direct competition between lexical units such that inhibition of irrelevant candidates leads to selection of critical words. Our results instead support predictive-selection theories (e.g., Predictive-Coding): by comparing heard and predicted speech sounds, neural computations of prediction error can help listeners continuously update lexical probabilities, allowing for more rapid word identification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Representations in Rat Orbitofrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus share striking cognitive and functional similarities. As a result, both structures have been proposed to encode "cognitive maps" that provide useful scaffolds for planning complex behaviors. However, while this function has been exemplified by spatial coding in neurons of hippocampal regions&mdash;particularly place and grid cells&mdash;spatial representations in the OFC have been investigated far less. Here we sought to address this by recording OFC neurons from male rats engaged in an open-field foraging task like that originally developed to characterize place fields in rodent hippocampal neurons. Single-unit activity was recorded as rats searched for food pellets scattered randomly throughout a large enclosure. In some sessions, particular flavors of food occurred more frequently in particular parts of the enclosure; in others, only a single flavor was used. OFC neurons showed spatially localized firing fields in both conditions, and representations changed between flavored and unflavored foraging periods in a manner reminiscent of remapping in the hippocampus. Compared with hippocampal recordings taken under similar behavioral conditions, OFC spatial representations were less temporally reliable, and there was no significant evidence of grid tuning in OFC neurons. These data confirm that OFC neurons show spatial firing fields in a large, two-dimensional environment in a manner similar to hippocampus. Consistent with the focus of the OFC on biological meaning and goals, spatial coding was weaker than in hippocampus and influenced by outcome identity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus have both been proposed to encode "cognitive maps" that provide useful scaffolds for planning complex behaviors. This function is exemplified by place and grid cells identified in hippocampus, the activity of which maps spatial environments. The current study directly demonstrates very similar, though not identical, spatial representatives in OFC neurons, confirming that OFC&mdash;like hippocampus&mdash;can represent a spatial map under the appropriate experimental conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Augmentation of Endocannabinoid Levels Persistently Increases Dopaminergic Encoding of Reward Cost and Motivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motivational deficits characterized by an unwillingness to overcome effortful costs are a common feature of neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders that are insufficiently understood and treated. Dopamine (DA) signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) facilitates goal-seeking, but how NAc DA release encodes motivationally salient stimuli to influence effortful investment is not clear. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in male and female mice, we find that NAc DA release diametrically responds to cues signaling increasing cost of reward, while DA release to the reward itself is unaffected by its cost. Because endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling facilitates goal seeking and NAc DA release, we further investigated whether repeated augmentation of the eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol with a low dose of a monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor facilitates motivation and DA signaling without the development of tolerance. We find that chronic MAGL treatment stably facilitates goal seeking and DA encoding of prior reward cost, providing critical insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of a viable treatment for motivational deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of work has established a fundamental role for dopamine neurotransmission in motivated behavior and cue&ndash;reward learning, but how dopaminergic encoding of cues associates with motivated action has remained unclear. Specifically, how dopamine neurons signal future and prior reward cost, and whether this can be modified to influence motivational set points is not known. The current study provides important insight into how dopamine neurons encode motivationally relevant stimuli to influence goal-directed action and supports cannabinoid-based therapies for treatment of motivational disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Sequencing Mechanisms Are Disrupted in a Maternal Immune Activation Model of Schizophrenia Risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Episodic memory requires information to be stored and recalled in sequential order, and these processes are disrupted in schizophrenia. Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences are thought to provide a biological mechanism for sequential ordering of experience at timescales suitable for plasticity. These phenomena have not previously been examined in any models of schizophrenia risk. Here, we examine these phenomena in a maternal immune activation (MIA) rodent model. We show that while individual pyramidal cells in the CA1 region continue to precess normally in MIA animals, the starting phase of precession as an animal enters a new place field is considerably more variable in MIA animals than in controls. A critical consequence of this change is a disorganization of the ordered representation of experience via theta sequences. These results provide the first evidence of a biological-level mechanism that, if it occurs in schizophrenia, may explain aspects of disorganized sequential processing that contribute to the cognitive symptoms of the disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences have been proposed as biophysical mechanisms by which the sequential structure of cognition might be ordered. Disturbances of sequential processing have frequently been observed in schizophrenia. Here, we show for the first time that phase precession and theta sequences are disrupted in a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia risk. This is a result of greater variability in the starting phase of precession, indicating that the mechanisms that coordinate precession at the assembly level are disrupted. We propose that this disturbance in phase precession underlies some of the disorganized cognitive symptoms that occur in schizophrenia. These findings could have important preclinical significance for the identification and treatment of schizophrenia risk factors.</p>

                Background: Low and medium income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to high income countries (HICs). This is primarily exacerbated by weak health systems especially at the pre-hospital care level. Generating local empirical evidence on TBI patterns and its influence on patient mortality outcomes is fundamental in informing the design of trauma-specific emergency medical service (EMS) interventions at the pre-hospital care level. This study determines the influence of TBI patterns and mortality. Methods: This was a case-control study with a sample of 316 TBI patients. Data was abstracted from medical records for the period of January 2017 to March 2019 in three tertiary trauma care facilities in Kenya. Logistic regression was used to assess influence of trauma patterns on TBI mortality, controlling for patient characteristics and other potential confounders. Results: The majority of patients were aged below 40 years (73%) and were male (85%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) comprised 58% of all forms of trauma. Blunt trauma comprised 71% of the injuries. Trauma mechanism was the only trauma pattern significantly associated with TBI mortality. The risk of dying for patients sustaining RTIs was 2.83 times more likely compared to non-RTI patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-4.93, p=0.001]. The type of transfer to hospital was also significantly associated with mortality outcome, with a public hospital having a two times higher risk of death compared to a private hospital [OR 2.18 95%CI 1.21-3.94, p<0.009]. Conclusion: Trauma mechanism (RTI vs non-RTI) and type of tertiary facility patients are transferred to (public vs private) are key factors influencing TBI mortality burden. Strengthening local EMS trauma response systems targeting RTIs augmented by adequately resourced and equipped public facilities to provide quality lifesaving interventions can reduce the burden of TBIs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Diffusion enables integration of heterogeneous data and user-driven learning in a desktop knowledge-base</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomasz Konopka, Sandra Ng, Damian Smedley</p>

Integrating reference datasets (e.g. from high-throughput experiments) with unstructured and manually-assembled information (e.g. notes or comments from individual researchers) has the potential to tailor bioinformatic analyses to specific needs and to lead to new insights. However, developing bespoke analysis pipelines from scratch is time-consuming, and general tools for exploring such heterogeneous data are not available. We argue that by treating all data as text, a knowledge-base can accommodate a range of bioinformatic data types and applications. We show that a database coupled to nearest-neighbor algorithms can address common tasks such as gene-set analysis as well as specific tasks such as ontology translation. We further show that a mathematical transformation motivated by diffusion can be effective for exploration across heterogeneous datasets. Diffusion enables the knowledge-base to begin with a sparse query, impute more features, and find matches that would otherwise remain hidden. This can be used, for example, to map multi-modal queries consisting of gene symbols and phenotypes to descriptions of diseases. Diffusion also enables user-driven learning: when the knowledge-base cannot provide satisfactory search results in the first instance, users can improve the results in real-time by adding domain-specific knowledge. User-driven learning has implications for data management, integration, and curation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A large-scale brain network mechanism for increased seizure propensity in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Tait, Marinho A. Lopes, George Stothart, John Baker, Nina Kazanina, Jiaxiang Zhang, Marc Goodfellow</p>

People with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are 6-10 times more likely to develop seizures than the healthy aging population. Leading hypotheses largely consider hyperexcitability of local cortical tissue as primarily responsible for increased seizure prevalence in AD. However, in the general population of people with epilepsy, large-scale brain network organization additionally plays a role in determining seizure likelihood and phenotype. Here, we propose that alterations to large-scale brain network organization seen in AD may contribute to increased seizure likelihood. To test this hypothesis, we combine computational modelling with electrophysiological data using an approach that has proved informative in clinical epilepsy cohorts without AD. EEG was recorded from 21 people with probable AD and 26 healthy controls. At the time of EEG acquisition, all participants were free from seizures. Whole brain functional connectivity derived from source-reconstructed EEG recordings was used to build subject-specific brain network models of seizure transitions. As cortical tissue excitability was increased in the simulations, AD simulations were more likely to transition into seizures than simulations from healthy controls, suggesting an increased group-level probability of developing seizures at a future time for AD participants. We subsequently used the model to assess seizure propensity of different regions across the cortex. We found the most important regions for seizure generation were those typically burdened by amyloid-beta at the early stages of AD, as previously reported by in-vivo and post-mortem staging of amyloid plaques. Analysis of these spatial distributions also give potential insight into mechanisms of increased susceptibility to generalized (as opposed to focal) seizures in AD vs controls. This research suggests avenues for future studies testing patients with seizures, e.g. co-morbid AD/epilepsy patients, and comparisons with PET and MRI scans to relate regional seizure propensity with AD pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Wing structure and neural encoding jointly determine sensing strategies in insect flight</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alison I. Weber, Thomas L. Daniel, Bingni W. Brunton</p>

Animals rely on sensory feedback to generate accurate, reliable movements. In many flying insects, strain-sensitive neurons on the wings provide rapid feedback that is critical for stable flight control. While the impacts of wing structure on aerodynamic performance have been widely studied, the impacts of wing structure on sensing are largely unexplored. In this paper, we show how the structural properties of the wing and encoding by mechanosensory neurons interact to jointly determine optimal sensing strategies and performance. Specifically, we examine how neural sensors can be placed effectively on a flapping wing to detect body rotation about different axes, using a computational wing model with varying flexural stiffness. A small set of mechanosensors, conveying strain information at key locations with a single action potential per wingbeat, enable accurate detection of body rotation. Optimal sensor locations are concentrated at either the wing base or the wing tip, and they transition sharply as a function of both wing stiffness and neural threshold. Moreover, the sensing strategy and performance is robust to both external disturbances and sensor loss. Typically, only five sensors are needed to achieve near-peak accuracy, with a single sensor often providing accuracy well above chance. Our results show that small-amplitude, dynamic signals can be extracted efficiently with spatially and temporally sparse sensors in the context of flight. The demonstrated interaction of wing structure and neural encoding properties points to the importance of understanding each in the context of their joint evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A modular approach for modeling the cell cycle based on functional response curves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jolan De Boeck, Jan Rombouts, Lendert Gelens</p>

Modeling biochemical reactions by means of differential equations often results in systems with a large number of variables and parameters. As this might complicate the interpretation and generalization of the obtained results, it is often desirable to reduce the complexity of the model. One way to accomplish this is by replacing the detailed reaction mechanisms of certain modules in the model by a mathematical expression that qualitatively describes the dynamical behavior of these modules. Such an approach has been widely adopted for ultrasensitive responses, for which underlying reaction mechanisms are often replaced by a single Hill function. Also time delays are usually accounted for by using an explicit delay in delay differential equations. In contrast, however, S-shaped response curves, which by definition have multiple output values for certain input values and are often encountered in bistable systems, are not easily modeled in such an explicit way. Here, we extend the classical Hill function into a mathematical expression that can be used to describe both ultrasensitive and S-shaped responses. We show how three ubiquitous modules (ultrasensitive responses, S-shaped responses and time delays) can be combined in different configurations and explore the dynamics of these systems. As an example, we apply our strategy to set up a model of the cell cycle consisting of multiple bistable switches, which can incorporate events such as DNA damage and coupling to the circadian clock in a phenomenological way.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dpp and Hedgehog promote the glial response to neuronal apoptosis in the developing Drosophila visual system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sergio B. Velarde, Alvaro Quevedo, Carlos Estella, Antonio Baonza</p>

Damage in the nervous system induces a stereotypical response that is mediated by glial cells. Here, we use the eye disc of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model to explore the mechanisms involved in promoting glial cell response after neuronal cell death induction. We demonstrate that these cells rapidly respond to neuronal apoptosis by increasing in number and undergoing morphological changes, which will ultimately grant them phagocytic abilities. We found that this glial response is controlled by the activity of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathways. These pathways are activated after cell death induction, and their functions are necessary to induce glial cell proliferation and migration to the eye discs. The latter of these 2 processes depend on the function of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which is activated by Dpp signalling. We also present evidence that a similar mechanism controls glial response upon apoptosis induction in the leg discs, suggesting that our results uncover a mechanism that might be involved in controlling glial cells response to neuronal cell death in different regions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

                Background: The new paradigm of government management has stimulated public organizations to establish innovative and competitive management policies through public entrepreneurship in order to provide excellent public service and to enhance public organizational performance. This research study aims to investigate the effects of government policy on organizational performance through the mediating role of public entrepreneurship of provincial administration organization in the upper northeastern region 2 in Thailand. Methods: This research employs a cross-sectional questionnaire study. Data were collected from 216 government officials through five-point Likert scale questionnaires with validity and reliability analyses. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistics toward path analysis. Results: The research results reveal that government policy has a significant direct influence on organizational performance with a standardized coefficient of 0.655. Government policy has a significant indirect effect on organizational performance through the mediating role of public entrepreneurship with a standardized coefficient of 0.566. The total effects can be described with a standardized coefficient of 0.733 at a 0.05 significance level. Conclusions: The government should establish innovative and competitive public policies to support a rapid change of entrepreneurial orientation, and transform policies into action. As public entrepreneurship has a significant mediating role in enhancing organizational performance, conventional public structures of performance management are being replaced by more innovative, adaptive, and competitive public entrepreneurship in order to get the desired and effective public outcomes for a provincial administration organization.

                Background: Non-communicable diseases, the major cause of death and disability, are susceptible to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by 4-5 times and can lead to cardiovascular mortality. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different sociodemographic factors on stroke development in patients with AF. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2018 on patients recruited from Lebanese community pharmacies. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is utilized as a stroke risk stratification tool in AF patients. Participants with a previous physician diagnosis of AF, documented on medical records, were included in this study. Results: A total of 524 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 58.75 (± SD) ± 13.59 years with hypertension (78.38%) being the most predominant disease. The results showed that obesity (Beta=0.610, p-value =0.011), retirement and unemployment compared to employment (Beta=1.440 and 1.440, p-value=0.001 respectively), divorced/widow compared to married (Beta=1.380, p-value =0.001) were significantly associated with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores whereas high versus low socio-economic status (Beta=-1.030, p=0.009) and high school education versus primary education level (Beta=-0.490, p-value=0.025) were significantly associated with lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Conclusions: The study highlights that the CHA2DS2-VASc score is affected by the presence of various sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics in patients with AF. Thus, screening for those factors may predict the progression of cardiovascular disease and may provide an optimal intervention.

                Respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared as a pandemic by WHO. The interaction between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in children is not widely known. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI), one class of drugs used to treat PH, including sildenafil, can suppress angiotensin type I (AT-1) receptor expression. Furthermore, it reduces proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrates the alveolar, inhibits endothelial and smooth muscle transition, mesenchymal cells in the pulmonary artery, and prevents clotting and thrombosis complications. Sildenafil has shown positive effects by diverting the blood flow to the lungs in such a way that ventilation is adequate and can also be anti-inflammatory.

                Background : This research aimed to examine and analyze risk factors for death, hematologic parameters and coagulation in COVID-19 patients at RSUD Dr. Soetomo Surabaya, one of the referral centers for probable COVID-19 patient cases in East Java. Method : This was a retrospective analytical study by taking secondary data on patients with probable COVID-19 cases who were treated in hospital isolation rooms from May to September, 2020. Result : Of 538 probable COVID-19 patients, 217  tested positive, with an average age of 52.11±13.12 years, and there were 38 death cases. Hematologic parameters, such as white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, were significantly different in the deceased group. On the other hand, coagulation parameters, consisting of D-dimer, CRP, PT, and aPTT showed significantly similar value in the deceased group. Univatiate analysis concluded that chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, WBC, NLR, and PPT counts could predict the mortality, while multivariate analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was the only significant independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion : This research shows that hematologic and coagulation parameters were increased in the majority of COVID-19 patients and the deceased group. While the number of neutrophils and WBC increases, the number of lymphocytes decreases significantly with increasing disease severity. Coronary heart disease is an independent predictor of mortality.

                Background: In developing countries, pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women. In this context, family planning and access to contraceptives are crucial for reducing pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we aimed to look into the trends of contraception and determinants of contraceptive use in Pakistan. Methods: This study used data for women of reproductive age from four Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys datasets. Contraception was the outcome variable, whereas, women’s and partner’s education, occupation, wealth quintile, region, place of residence, and exposure to family planning messages were the explanatory variables. Pooled prevalence was estimated using SUMARI and regression analysis was undertaken using SPSS to produce an adjusted prevalence ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Data of 40,259 ever-married women of reproductive age (EMWRA) was analysed. Of the total EMWRA, 30% were using contraception. Of these, 26% were using traditional methods and 74% were using modern methods. The most common method of contraception was condoms (30.5%). The pooled prevalence of contraception used was 29.5% (95% CI 29.1 to 30.0). Through multivariate analysis, women's age, place of residence, region, wealth index, women’s education, their working status, and exposure to family planning messages were found to be significant determinants of contraception usage. Conclusions: There is a noticeable gap regarding awareness and uptake of contraception leading to low contraceptive use among women in Pakistan. In the light of our results, it is important to highlight the importance of girl’s education for building awareness and empowerment.

                Background: This study aimed to determine the potential anti-aging effects of sea grapes and tempe (Fermented soybeans) collagen particle size, by measuring the activities of anti-glycation, antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitors. Methods: Collagen was isolated from sea grapes and tempe freeze dried powder and treated with different NaOH concentrations (0.10 M; 0.20 M; 0.30 M), and CH3COOH 1 M solution, separately. The collagen particle size was adjusted by stirring at 1000 rpm for 5 and 10 hours. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to measure the antioxidant activity, and L-tyrosine and L-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) were used as a marker of tyrosine inhibition.  Results:  The collagen treated with 0.10 M NaOH produced the highest collagen yield (11.65%), and largest particle size (2455 nm). Additionally, this collagen, when treated for 5 hours, exhibited 24.70% antioxidant activity, 62.60% anti-glycation, 8.97% L-tyrosine, and 26.77% L-Dopa inhibition activities. Meanwhile, the collagen treated for 10 hours had a 9.98% antioxidant activity, 41.48% anti-glycation, 7.89% L-tyrosine, and 2.67% L-Dopa inhibition activity.  Conclusion: Sea grapes and tempe collagen powder treated with 0.10 M NaOH and stirred for 5 hours, as functional foods have anti-aging properties.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Teaching and learning how to make informed health choices: Protocol for a context analysis in Spanish primary schools [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The Informed Health Choices (IHC) project developed learning resources to teach primary school children (10 to 12-year-olds) to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices. The aim of our study is to explore the educational context for teaching and learning critical thinking about health in Spanish primary schools. Methods During the 2020-2021 school year, we will conduct 1) a systematic assessment of educational documents and resources, and 2) semi-structured interviews with key education and health stakeholders. In the systematic assessment of educational documents and resources, we will include state and autonomous communities’ curriculums, school educational projects, and commonly used textbooks and other health teaching materials. In the semi-structured interviews, we will involve education and health policy makers, developers of learning resources, developers of health promotion and educational interventions, head teachers, teachers, families, and paediatric primary care providers. We will design and pilot a data extraction form and a semi-structured interview guide to collect the data. We will perform a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of the data to explore how critical thinking about health is being taught and learned in Spanish primary schools. Conclusion We will identify opportunities for and barriers to teaching and learning critical thinking about health in Spanish primary schools. We will formulate recommendations—for both practice and research purposes—on how to use, adapt (if needed), and implement the IHC resources in this context.

                Izadifar, Courchet, et al. demonstrate an evolutionary conserved role for Wnk kinases in axon morphogenesis and adult axon maintenance. These dual roles of Wnk kinases involve regulation of components of the Wallerian degeneration network. This study provides evidence for a shared regulatory network linking developmental axon branching, maintenance, and degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Separable pupillary signatures of perception and action during perceptual multistability</a></h4>

              
                The pupil provides a rich, non-invasive measure of the neural bases of perception and cognition, and has been of particular value in uncovering the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation, which alters both cortical processing and pupil size. But pupil size is subject to a multitude of influences, which complicates unique interpretation. We measured pupils of observers experiencing perceptual multistability -- an ever-changing subjective percept in the face of unchanging but inconclusive sensory input. In separate conditions the endogenously generated perceptual changes were either task-relevant or not, allowing a separation between perception-related and task-related pupil signals. Perceptual changes were marked by a complex pupil response that could be decomposed into two components: a dilation tied to task execution and plausibly indicative of an arousal-linked noradrenaline surge, and an overlapping constriction tied to the perceptual transient and plausibly a marker of altered visual cortical representation. Constriction, but not dilation, amplitude systematically depended on the time interval between perceptual changes, possibly providing an overt index of neural adaptation. These results show that the pupil provides a simultaneous reading on interacting but dissociable neural processes during perceptual multistability, and suggest that arousal-linked neuromodulator release shapes action but not perception in these circumstances.

                Traditional drug safety assessment often fails to predict complications in humans, especially when the drug targets the immune system. Here, we show the unprecedented capability of two human Organs-on-Chips to evaluate the safety profile of T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) targeting tumor antigens. Although promising for cancer immunotherapy, TCBs are associated with an on-target, off-tumor risk due to low levels of expression of tumor antigens in healthy tissues. We leveraged in vivo target expression and toxicity data of TCBs targeting folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to design and validate human immunocompetent Organs-on-Chips safety platforms. We discovered that the Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip could reproduce and predict target-dependent TCB safety liabilities, based on sensitivity to key determinants thereof, such as target expression and antibody affinity. These novel tools broaden the research options available for mechanistic understandings of engineered therapeutic antibodies and assessing safety in tissues susceptible to adverse events.

                Bone marrow adipocytes accumulate with age and in diverse disease states. However, their origins and adaptations in these conditions remain unclear, impairing our understanding of their context-specific endocrine functions and relationship with surrounding tissues. In this study, by analyzing bone and adipose tissues in the lipodystrophic 'fat-free' mouse, we define a novel, secondary adipogenesis pathway that relies on the recruitment of adiponectin-negative stromal progenitors. This pathway is unique to the bone marrow and is activated with age and in states of metabolic stress in the fat-free mouse model, resulting in the expansion of bone marrow adipocytes specialized for lipid storage with compromised lipid mobilization and cytokine expression within regions traditionally devoted to hematopoiesis. This finding further distinguishes bone marrow from peripheral adipocytes and contributes to our understanding of bone marrow adipocyte origins, adaptation, and relationships with surrounding tissues with age and disease.

                Maintenance of immune homeostasis involves a synergistic relationship between the host and the microbiome. Canonical interferon (IFN) signaling controls responses to acute microbial infection, through engagement of the STAT1 transcription factor. However, the contribution of tonic levels of IFN to immune homeostasis in absence of acute infection remains largely unexplored. We report that STAT1 KO mice spontaneously developed an inflammatory disease marked by myeloid hyperplasia and splenic accumulation of hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, these animals developed inflammatory bowel disease. Profiling gut bacteria revealed a profound dysbiosis in absence of tonic IFN signaling, which triggered expansion of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and loss of splenic T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Reduction of bacterial load by antibiotic treatment averted the T<sub>H</sub>17 bias, and blocking IL17 signaling prevented myeloid expansion and splenic stem cell accumulation. Thus, tonic IFNs regulate gut microbial ecology, which is crucial for maintaining physiologic immune homeostasis and preventing inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative control of noise in mammalian gene expression by dynamic histone regulation</a></h4>

              
                Fluctuation ('noise') in gene expression is critical for mammalian cellular processes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to its origins, yet the mechanisms behind large fluctuations that are induced by single transcriptional activators remain elusive. Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the modulation of noise in synthetic and endogenous gene expression systems.

                Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of 'infinite-pseudocolor' anatomical reconstruction --- i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique barcoded 'pseudocolor,' and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach to recover the barcodes that label each neuron. We also develop a neural network which uses these barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed fluorescence imaging data, 'connecting the dots' between discontiguous amplicon signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No need to choose: independent regulation of cognitive stability and flexibility challenges the stability-flexibility tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires the ability to focus on a current task and protect it from distraction (cognitive stability) as well as the ability to rapidly switch to another task in light of changing circumstances (cognitive flexibility). Cognitive stability and flexibility have commonly been conceptualized as opposite endpoints on a stability-flexibility tradeoff continuum, implying an obligatory reciprocity between the two: greater flexibility necessitates less stability, and vice versa. Surprisingly, rigorous empirical tests of this critical assumption are lacking, however. Here, we tested this assumption by acquiring simultaneous measurements of cognitive stability (congruency effects) and flexibility (switch costs) while independently varying contextual demands on these functions with block-wise manipulations of the proportion of incongruent trials and task switches, respectively. If cognitive stability and flexibility are reciprocal, an increase in flexibility in response to higher switch rates should lead to a commensurate decrease in stability, and an increase in stability in response to more frequent incongruent trials should result in decreased flexibility. Across three experiments, using classic cued task switching (Experiments 1 and 3) and attentional set shifting (Experiment 2) protocols, we found robust evidence against an obligatory stability-flexibility tradeoff. Although we observed the expected contextual adaptation of stability and flexibility to changing demands, strategic adjustments in stability had no influence on flexibility, and vice versa. These results refute the long-held assumption of a stability-flexibility tradeoff, documenting instead that the cognitive processes mediating these functions can be regulated independently - it is possible to be both stable and flexible at the same time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signals the Need to Control Intrusive Thoughts During Motivated Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                How do people limit awareness of unwanted memories? Evidence suggests that when unwelcome memories intrude, a retrieval stopping process engages the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC; Michael C. Anderson et al., 2004) to inhibit hippocampal activity (Benoit & Anderson, 2012; Benoit, Hulbert, Huddleston, & Anderson, 2015; Gagnepain, Hulbert, & Anderson, 2017) and disrupt retrieval. It remains unknown how and when the need to engage prefrontal control is detected, and whether control operates proactively to prevent an unwelcome memory from being retrieved, or must respond reactively, to counteract its intrusion. We hypothesized that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) achieves this function by detecting signals indicating that an unwanted trace is emerging in awareness, and transmitting the need for inhibitory control to right DLPFC (Alexander & Brown, 2011; Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001). During a memory suppression task, we measured trial-by-trial variations in dACC's theta power and N2 amplitude, two electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of the need for enhanced control (Cavanagh & Frank, 2014). With simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, we tracked dynamic interactions between the dACC, rDLPFC and hippocampus during suppression. EEG analyses revealed a clear role of dACC in detecting the need for memory control, and in upregulating prefrontal inhibition. Importantly, we identified dACC contributions before episodic retrieval could have occurred (500 ms) and afterwards, indicating distinct proactive and reactive control signalling. Stronger proactive control by the dACC led to reduced hippocampal activity and diminished overall blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in dACC and rDLPFC, suggesting that pre-empting retrieval early reduced overall control demands. However, when dACC activity followed the likely onset of recollection, retrieval was cancelled reactively: effective connectivity analyses revealed robust communication from dACC to rDLPFC and from rDLPFC to hippocampus, tied to successful forgetting. Together, our findings support a model in which dACC detects the emergence of unwanted content, triggering top-down inhibitory control, and in which rDLPFC countermands intruding thoughts that penetrate awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Caveats and nuances of model-based and model-free representational connectivity analysis</a></h4>

              
                Brain connectivity analyses have conventionally relied on statistical relationship between one-dimensional summaries of activation in different brain areas. However, summarising activation patterns within each area to a single dimension ignores the potential statistical dependencies between their multi-dimensional activity patterns. Representational Connectivity Analyses (RCA) is a method that quantifies the relationship between multi-dimensional patterns of activity without reducing the dimensionality of the data. We consider two variants of RCA. In model-free RCA, the goal is to quantify the shared information for two brain regions. In model-based RCA, one tests whether two regions have shared information about a specific aspect of the stimuli/task, as defined by a model. However, this is a new approach and the potential caveats of model-free and model-based RCA are still understudied. We first explain how model-based RCA detects connectivity through the lens of models, and then present three scenarios where model-based and model-free RCA give discrepant results. These conflicting results complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity. We highlight the challenges in three scenarios: complex intermediate models, common patterns across regions and transformation of representational structure across brain regions. The paper is accompanied by scripts that reproduce the results. In each case, we suggest potential ways to mitigate the difficulties caused by inconsistent results. The results of this study shed light on some understudied aspects of RCA, and allow researchers to use the method more effectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Soma and Neurite Density MRI (SANDI) of the in-vivo mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into the neural tissue milieu by probing interaction of diffusing molecules and tissue microstructure. Most dMRI techniques focus on white matter tissues (WM) due to the relatively simpler modelling of diffusion in the more organized tracts; however, interest is growing in gray matter characterisations. The Soma and Neurite Density MRI (SANDI) methodology harnesses a model incorporating water diffusion in spherical objects (assumed to be associated with cell bodies) and in impermeable 'sticks' (representing neurites), which potentially enables the characterisation of cellular and neurite densities. Recognising the importance of rodents in animal models of development, aging, plasticity, and disease, we here sought to develop SANDI for preclinical imaging and provide a validation of the methodology by comparing its metrics with the Allen mouse brain atlas. SANDI was implemented on a 9.4T scanner equipped with a cryogenic coil, and experiments were carried out on N=6 mice. Pixelwise, ROI-based, and atlas comparisons were performed, and results were also compared to more standard Diffusion Kurtosis MRI (DKI) metrics. We further investigated effects of different pre-processing pipelines, specifically the comparison of magnitude and real-valued data, as well as different acceleration factors. Our findings reveal excellent reproducibility of the SANDI parameters, including the sphere and stick fraction as well as sphere size. More strikingly, we find a very good rank correlation between SANDI-driven soma fraction and Allen brain atlas contrast (which represents the cellular density in the mouse brain). Although some DKI parameters (FA, MD) correlated with some SANDI parameters in some ROIs, they did not correlate nearly as well as SANDI parameters with the Allen atlas, suggesting a much more specific nature of the SANDI parameters. We conclude that SANDI is a viable preclinical MRI technique that can greatly contribute to research on brain tissue microstructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered sleep intensity upon DBS to hypothalamic sleep-wake centers in rats</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been scarcely investigated in the field of sleep research. We hypothesize that DBS onto hypothalamic sleep- and wake-promoting centers will produce significant neuromodulatory effects, and potentially become a therapeutic strategy for patients suffering severe, drug-refractory sleep-wake disturbances. We aimed to investigate whether continuous electrical high-frequency DBS, such as that often implemented in clinical practice, in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) or the perifornical area of the posterior lateral hypothalamus (PeFLH), significantly modulates sleep-wake characteristics and behavior. We implanted healthy rats with electroencephalographic/electromyographic electrodes and recorded vigilance states in parallel to bilateral bipolar stimulation of VLPO and PeFLH at 125 Hz at 90 microA over 24 h to test the modulating effects of DBS on sleep-wake proportions, stability and spectral power in relation to baseline. We unexpectedly found that VLPO DBS at 125 Hz deepens slow-wave sleep as measured by increased delta power, while sleep proportions and fragmentation remain unaffected. Thus, the intensity, but not the amount of sleep or its stability, is modulated. Similarly, the proportion and stability of vigilance states remained altogether unaltered upon PeFLH DBS but, in contrast to VLPO, 125 Hz stimulation unexpectedly weakened SWS, evidenced by reduced delta power. This study provides novel insights into non-acute functional outputs of major sleep-wake centers in the rat brain in response to electrical high-frequency stimulation, a paradigm frequently used in human DBS. In the conditions assayed, while exerting no major effects on sleep-wake architecture, hypothalamic high-frequency stimulation arises as a provocative sleep intensity-modulating approach.

                Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) sever and permanently disrupt sensorimotor neural circuitry. Restoring connectivity within the damaged circuitry is critical to improving function. Herein we report robust regeneration of severed neural circuitry in a rat SCI model following transplantation of human induced pluripotent cells differentiated towards a deep cortical neuron lineage (iPSC-DCNs). In vivo, iPSC-DCNs: (1) integrated within the damaged cord and extended axons to caudal targets, (2) reversed SCI pathophysiology, (3) promoted robust regeneration of severed host supraspinal neural tracts, (4) and improved sensorimotor function. The results herein represent a significant paradigm shift in anatomical and functional outcomes over current preclinical/clinical models and demonstrates the survival and efficacy of human stem cell-derived cortical neurons in a SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term Transverse Imaging of the Hippocampus with Glass Microperiscopes</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus consists of a stereotyped neuronal circuit repeated along the septal-temporal axis. This transverse circuit contains distinct subfields with stereotyped connectivity that support crucial cognitive processes, including episodic and spatial memory. However, comprehensive measurements across the transverse hippocampal circuit in vivo are intractable with existing techniques. Here, we developed an approach for two-photon imaging of the transverse hippocampal plane in awake mice via implanted glass microperiscopes, allowing optical access to the major hippocampal subfields and to the dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons. Using this approach, we tracked dendritic morphological dynamics on CA1 apical dendrites and characterized spine turnover. We then used calcium imaging to quantify the prevalence of place and speed cells across subfields. Finally, we measured the anatomical distribution of spatial information, finding a non-uniform distribution of spatial selectivity along the DG-to-CA1 axis. This approach extends the existing toolbox for structural and functional measurements of hippocampal circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical control of visually-guided movements in a 3D-printed robot arm</a></h4>

              
                The control architecture guiding simple movements such as reaching toward a visual target remains an open problem. The nervous system needs to integrate different sensory modalities and coordinate multiple degrees of freedom in the human arm to achieve that goal. The challenge increases due to noise and transport delays in neural signals, nonlinear and fatigable muscles as actuators, and unpredictable environmental disturbances. Here we examined the capabilities of a previously proposed hierarchical feedback control model (Powers 1999, 2008), so far only tested in silico. We built a robot arm system with four degrees of freedom, including a visual system for locating the planar position of the hand, joint angle proprioception, and pressure sensing in one point of contact. We subjected the robot to various human-inspired reaching and tracking tasks and found features of biological movement, such as isochrony and bell-shaped velocity profiles in straight-line movements, and the speed-curvature power law in curved movements. These behavioral properties emerge without trajectory planning or explicit optimization algorithms. We then applied static structural perturbations to the robot: we blocked the wrist joint, tilted the writing surface, extended the hand with a tool, and rotated the visual system. For all of them, we found that the arm in machina adapts its behavior without being reprogrammed. In sum, while limited in speed and precision (by the nature of the do-it-yourself inexpensive components we used to build the robot from scratch), when faced with the noise, delays, nonlinearities, and unpredictable disturbances of the real world, the embodied control architecture shown here balances biological realism with design simplicity.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multisystem, chronic and so far incurable disease with significant unmet medical needs. The incidence of PD increases with aging and the expected burden will continue to escalate with our aging population. Since its discovery in the 1961 levodopa remains the gold standard pharmacotherapy for PD. However, the progressive nature of the neurodegenerative process in and beyond the nigrostriatal system causes a multitude of side effects, including levodopa-induced dyskinesia within 5 years of therapy. Attenuating dyskinesia has been a significant challenge in the clinical management of PD. We report on a small molecule that eliminates the expression of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and significantly improves PD-like symptoms. The lead compound PD13R we discovered is a dopamine D3 receptor partial agonist with high affinity and selectivity, orally active and with desirable drug-like properties. Future studies are aimed at developing this lead compound for treating PD patients with dyskinesia.

                The efficient coding hypothesis postulates that neurons shape their response properties to match their dynamic range to the statistics of incoming signals. However, whether and how the dynamics of efficient neuronal adaptation inform behavior has not been directly shown. Here, we trained mice to detect a target presented in background noise shortly after a change in the background contrast. The observed changes in cortical gain and detection behavior followed the predictions of a normative model of efficient cortical sound processing; specifically, target detection and sensitivity to target volume improved in low contrast backgrounds relative to high contrast backgrounds. Additionally, the time course of target detectability adapted asymmetrically depending on contrast, decreasing rapidly after a transition to high contrast, and increasing more slowly after a transition to low contrast. Auditory cortex was required for detection of targets in background noise and cortical neuronal responses exhibited the patterns of target detectability observed during behavior and in the normative model. Furthermore, variability in cortical gain predicted behavioral performance beyond the effect of stimulus-driven gain control. Combined, our results demonstrate that efficient neural codes in auditory cortex directly influence perceptual behavior.

	<p>Introduction: The aim of this study is a comprehensive analysis of the parameters of exogenous evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), a prototype of both neuromuscular junction disease and autoimmune disease. The study also seeks to isolate electrophysiological changes that may indicate disorders within the central and/or peripheral nervous system. Methods: A total of forty-two consecutive patients with myasthenia gravis (24 women, 18 men) were included in the study. All of the patients underwent EP examination. MR images were also analyzed. Results: In the group of MG patients, the latency of P100 (113.9 ± 13.9; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) VEP, wave III (3.92 ± 0.29; p = 0.015), wave V (5.93 ± 0.32; &amp;amp;lt;0.0001), interlatency III–V (2.00 ± 0.12; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), interlatency I–V (4.20 ± 0.28; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) BAEP, and all components of SEP (N9, P10, N13, P16, N20, P22) were significantly longer. Mean wave I and V amplitude BAEP were relatively lower. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest the presence of disturbances in the bioelectric activities of the central and peripheral nervous system in MG patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Concerning the judgments bias and cue utilization in basketball athletes, previous shot anticipation tasks were hard to examine in regards to whether the experts’ judgement bias relies more on the cue of the player’s body or the ball trajectory. Methods: Four types of body–ball cues shots were employed: IN–IN, IN–OUT, OUT–IN, and OUT–OUT. Four temporal stages (i.e., shooting, rising, high point, and falling) were divided during a shot. Forty-two participants predicted the fate of the ball after watching the shot videos. Results: The results suggested that for the shooting, rising, and high point phase, compared to the non-athletes, the experts provided superior predictions for IN–IN condition and OUT–IN condition but fewer accurate predictions for IN–OUT condition and OUT–OUT condition. Moreover, a higher bias toward predicting the shots as “in” for the athletes than the non-athletes under early temporal conditions was confirmed. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the idea that the IN cues from both body information and ball trajectory could elicit the experts’ judgement bias for made shots and then influence their response, thus rendered two distinct (e.g., impeding and facilitating) effects for the incongruent body–ball cues, respectively.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anosognosia and impairment of insight are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can lead to delays in appropriate medical care and significant family discord. The default mode network (DMN), a distributed but highly connected network of brain regions more active during rest than during task, is integrally involved in awareness. DMN dysfunction is common in AD, and disrupted communication between memory-related and self-related DMN networks is associated with anosognosia in AD patients. In addition, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a key region of the “social brain” and also contributes to representations of the self. The exact classification of the TPJ within the DMN is unclear, though connections between the TPJ and DMN have been highlighted in multiple avenues of research. Here we discuss the relationship between the TPJ, DMN, and AD, as well as the potential involvement of the TPJ in anosognosia in AD. We review past and present findings to raise attention to the TPJ, with a specific emphasis on neuroimaging technologies which suggest a pivotal role of the TPJ within large-scale brain networks linked to anosognosia in AD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease-modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1α/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.</p>

     alt="14-3-3ζ is crucial for the conversion of labile short-term object recognition memory into stable long-term memory"/>
<p>The upregulation of 14-3-3ζ facilitates the transformation of labile object recognition memory (ORM) into stable ORM and causes the increase in brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) expression, which further aids in the consolidation of newly formed ORM to long-term memory. The blockage of either 14-3-3ζ or BDNF expression abolishes the formation of long-term ORM (LT-ORM).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of new memories into long-lasting memories is multistage process characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. However, our understanding on the initial stage of transformation of labile memory of recent experience into stable memory remains elusive. Here, with the use of rats and mice overexpressing a memory enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14<sub>414</sub>) as a tool, we show that the expression of RGS14<sub>414</sub> in male rats' perirhinal cortex (PRh), which is a brain area crucial for object recognition memory (ORM), enhanced the ORM to the extent that it caused the conversion of labile short-term ORM (ST-ORM) expected to last for 40 min into stable long-term ORM (LT-ORM) traceable after a delay of 24 hr, and that the temporal window of 40 to 60 min after object exposure not only was key for this conversion but also was the time frame when a surge in 14-3-3ζ protein was observed. A knockdown of 14-3-3ζ gene abrogated both the increase in 14-3-3ζ protein and the formation of LT-ORM. Furthermore, this 14-3-3ζ upregulation increased brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) levels in the time frame of 60 min and 24 hr and 14-3-3ζ knockdown decreased the BDNF levels, and a deletion of BDNF gene produced loss in mice ability to form LT-ORM. Thus, within 60 min of object exposure, 14-3-3ζ facilitated the conversion of labile ORM into stable ORM, whereas beyond the 60 min, it mediated the consolidation of the stable memory into long-lasting ORM by regulating BDNF signaling.</p>

     alt="Sinonasal surgery alters brain structure and function: Neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory dysfunction"/>
<p>This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5-year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross-sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</p>

     alt="Functional brain network topology across the menstrual cycle is estradiol dependent and correlates with individual well-being"/>
<p>The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (<i>N</i> = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri-ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid-luteal and peri-ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone-related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large-scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early-follicular, peri-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and well-being. We showed that during the peri-ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well-being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large-scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</p>

<p>Hypoxia has an immense effect on the retina, especially on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It causes cell damage and results in vision loss. In this study, the electrical RGC activity under hypoxic conditions is analyzed using a multielectrode array-based <i>ex vivo</i> model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Several eye diseases, for example, retinal artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are associated with retinal hypoxia. The lack of oxygen in the retina, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causes cell damage up to cell degeneration and leads to blindness. Using multielectrode array recordings, an <i>ex vivo</i> hypoxia acute model was established to analyze the electrical activity of murine wild-type retinae under hypoxic stress conditions. Hypoxia was induced by exchanging the perfusion with oxygen-saturated medium by nitrogen-saturated medium. Hypoxic periods of 0 min (control) up to 60 min were tested on the retinae of adult female C57BL/6J mice. The electrical RGC activity vanished during hypoxia, but conditionally returned after the reestablishment of conventional test conditions. With increasing duration of hypoxia, the returning RGC activity decreased. After a hypoxic period of 30 min and a subsequent recovery time of 30 min, 59.43 ± 11.35% of the initially active channels showed a restored RGC activity. The survival rate of retinal cells after hypoxic stress was analyzed by a live/dead staining assay using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. For detailed information about molecular changes caused by hypoxia, a microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Furthermore, the effect of 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, 1 mM) on retinae under hypoxic stress was tested. Treatment with taurine resulted in an increase in the RGC response rate after hypoxia and also increased the survival rate of retinal cells under hypoxic stress, confirming its potential as promising candidate for neuroprotective therapies of eye diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy-induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure-induced damages in ANS-control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy-related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</p>

<p>Our longitudinal study revealed increases of the amygdala during the postpartum period. Volumes and subvolumes of the amygdala were analyzed by integrating imaging-based signal intensities with cytoarchitectonically defined probabilities.</p>
<p>​</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region-of-interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region-specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever-changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</p>

<p>Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra-mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria-enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra-mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.</p>

<p>Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin-4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin-4 and <i>N</i>-acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline-derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi-disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.</p>

<p>Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST<sup>+</sup> precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST<sup>+</sup> cells, which co-express astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 (ACSA-2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA-2) reveals GLAST<sup>+</sup> cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial-like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial-like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia-like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 (ACSA-2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA-2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA-2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co-expression of ACSA-2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA-2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG-like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA-2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia-committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.</p>

     alt="The synaptic blocker botulinum toxin A decreases the density and complexity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the adult mouse hippocampus"/>
<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) sense glutamate released at synapses via direct synaptic contacts and through volume transmission, which regulates the OPC stem cell like property of self-renewal. In this study, we show that blocking synaptic transmission using botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) significantly decreased OPC numbers and resulted in cellular atrophy <i>in vivo</i> in the adult mouse hippocampus. Adult OPCs are responsible for life-long generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes and dysregulation of OPC function would potentially decrease their capacity for repair in pathological scenarios characterized by decreased synaptic activity, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are responsible for generating oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Life-long myelination is promoted by neuronal activity and is essential for neural network plasticity and learning. OPCs are known to contact synapses and it is proposed that neuronal synaptic activity in turn regulates their behavior. To examine this in the adult, we performed unilateral injection of the synaptic blocker botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) into the hippocampus of adult mice. We confirm BoNT/A cleaves SNAP-25 in the CA1 are of the hippocampus, which has been proven to block neurotransmission. Notably, BoNT/A significantly decreased OPC density and caused their shrinkage, as determined by immunolabeling for the OPC marker NG2. Furthermore, BoNT/A resulted in an overall decrease in the number of OPC processes, as well as a decrease in their lengths and branching frequency. These data indicate that synaptic activity is important for maintaining adult OPC numbers and cellular integrity, which is relevant to pathophysiological scenarios characterized by dysregulation of synaptic activity, such as age-related cognitive decline, Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Behavioral tests assaying digging can be difficult to interpret. We present a novel paradigm combining burrowing and free digging that can be used to explore digging motivation and sex-specific deficits.</p>
<p>​</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Digging behavior is often used to test motor function and repetitive behaviors in mice. Different digging paradigms have been developed for behaviors related to anxiety and compulsion in mouse lines generated to recapitulate genetic mutations leading to psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, the interpretation of these tests has been confounded by the difficulty of determining the motivation behind digging in mice. Digging is a naturalistic mouse behavior that can be focused toward different goals, that is foraging for food, burrowing for shelter, burying objects, or even for recreation as has been shown for dogs, ferrets, and human children. However, the interpretation of results from current testing protocols assumes the motivation behind the behavior often concluding that increased digging is a repetitive or compulsive behavior. We asked whether providing a choice between different types of digging activities would increase sensitivity to assess digging motivation. Here, we present a test to distinguish between burrowing and exploratory digging in mice. We found that mice prefer burrowing when the option is available. When food restriction was used to promote a switch from burrowing to exploration, males readily switched from burrowing to digging outside, while females did not. In addition, when we tested a model of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder that had shown inconsistent results in the marble burying test, the <i>Cc2d1a</i> conditional knockout mouse, we found greatly reduced burrowing only in males. Our findings indicate that digging is a nuanced motivated behavior and suggest that male and female rodents may perform it differently.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide original data to investigate age-related brain changes. We examined neural activity modulations induced by two multifocal tDCS procedures based on two distinct montages fitting two N-back task-based fMRI patterns (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) related to high working memory (WM) in a previous publication (Fernández-Cabello et al. Neurobiol Aging (2016);48:23–33). We included 24 participants classified as stable or decliners according to their 4-year WM trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal approach. Then, we studied longitudinal fMRI differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across multifocal tDCS montages (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) applied using a single-blind sham-controlled cross-over design. Decliners evidenced over-activation of non-related WM areas after 4 years of follow-up. Focusing on tDCS effects, among the decliner group, the “compensatory”-tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation. These results reinforce the notion that tDCS effects are characterized by an activity reduction and might be more noticeable in compromised systems. Importantly, the data provide novel evidence that cognitive trajectories predict tDCS effects in older adults.</p>

     alt="Cleaved PINK1 induces neuronal plasticity through PKA-mediated BDNF functional regulation"/>
<p>In healthy mitochondria, cleaved PINK1 retro-translocates to the cytosol, where it phosphorylates and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activation results in the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which subsequently relocates to the nucleus to promote the transcription of genes in CRE-localized domains. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the targets of CREB-mediated transcription. BDNF gets transcribed, translated, post-translationally cleaved, and released into the extracellular space, where it binds to the TRKβ receptor and triggers the synaptic delivery of PSD95.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) lead to early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease in humans. In healthy neurons, full-length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post-translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra-mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA-modulated transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor-TRKβ. Mechanistically, cPINK1-mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKβ. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Extensive alterations in gene regulatory networks are a typical characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD); these include alterations in protein-coding genes and poorly understood non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with pathology caused by mutant huntingtin. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of ncRNAs involved in a variety of biological functions, including transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional modification of many targets, and likely contributed to the pathogenesis of HD. While a number of changes in lncRNAs expression have been observed in HD, little is currently known about their functions. Here, we discuss their possible mechanisms and molecular functions, with a particular focus on their roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings give us a better insight into HD pathogenesis and may provide new targets for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0–10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance-based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract-based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.</p>

<p>Lentivirally packaged clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) library is transduced into glioblastoma cells (1,000 cells transduced/single guide RNA after drug selection), with transduced cells injected into the mouse cortex, and resected under fluorescence guidance after 2-week growth. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting isolates viable, transduced cells, and sequencing of tagged cells identifies specific gene knockdowns associated with <i>in vivo</i> growth.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-based genetic screens offer unbiased and powerful tools for systematic and specific evaluation of phenotypes associated with specific target genes. CRISPR screens have been utilized heavily <i>in vitro</i> to identify functional coding and noncoding genes in a large number of cell types, including glioblastoma (GB), though no prior study has described the evaluation of CRISPR screening in GB <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we describe a protocol for targeting and transcriptionally repressing GB-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system <i>in vivo</i>, with tumor growth in the mouse cerebral cortex. Given the target-specific parameters of each individual screen, we list general steps involved in transducing guide RNA libraries into GB tumor lines, maintaining sufficient coverage, as well as cortically injecting and subsequently isolating transduced screen tumor cell populations for analysis. Finally, in order to demonstrate the use of this technique to discern an essential lncRNA, HOTAIR, from a nonessential lncRNA, we injected a 1:1 (HOTAIR:control nonessential lncRNA knockdown) mixture of fluorescently tagged U87 GB cells into the cortex of eight mice, evaluating selective depletion of HOTAIR-tagged cells at 2 weeks of growth. Fluorescently tagged populations were analyzed via flow cytometry for hiBFP (control knockdown) and green fluorescent protein (HOTAIR knockdown), revealing 17% (<i>p</i> = 0.007) decrease in fluorescence associated with HOTAIR knockdown relative to control. The described <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR screening methodology thus appears to be an effective option for identifying noncoding (and coding) genes affecting GB growth within the mouse cortex.</p>

                Hydatic cyst may occur in many organs such as the liver, lung, brain or heart with radiologic features of liver and lung involvement being well known. The musculo-skeletal site is infrequent accounting for 0.7–3% cases of all cases resulting from direct implantation of oncospheres more often than hematic dissemination. We report the case of an 18-year-old female student who visited our hospital because of a swelling in the posteroexternal aspect of the left thigh that had grown during the previous six months and had become tender in the previous month with setup of fever three days before admission. Superficial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic mass of the posterior compartment of the thigh developed within the short chief of the biceps femoris. Serology for hydatid cyst was positive. The diagnosis of an infected hydatid cyst was suspected preoperatively, and the patient was given antibiotics and anthelminthic treatment. The cyst was then completely excised and the histopathologic exam confirmed the hydatic origin. The patient was put on oral anti-helminthics and has been on regular follow up for last twelve months with no evidence of recurrence. Hydatidosis rarely occurs in the soft tissues and the diagnosis is challenging particularly when it is secondary infected. Hydatid serology provides certainty in the diagnosis of echinococcosis when it is positive. When it’s negative, imaging (Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be an approach for making the diagnosis revealing the most characteristic features of hydatid cyst.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Self-reported COVID-19 among physicians: An Egyptian online study during the pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract:  Background: COVID-19 causes a critical occupational risk to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who respond to the pandemic, as they are placed in environments with an increased risk of infection exposure. It is a public health priority to understand how transmission occurs to protect this vulnerable group of HCWs. This study was conducted to estimate the incidence of self-reported COVID-19 infection among physicians and its possible associated factors. Methods: An online national survey using Survey Monkey was initiated to collect sociodemographic e.g. age and sex, occupational e.g. place and duration of work, and clinical data e.g. COVID symptoms and laboratory investigations, and to describe affected physicians' diagnoses. Results: The self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection was found to be 65.4% among studied physicians. The significant independent predictors of COVID-19 infection were  smoking, working as a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than ten years [ARR (95% CI): 3.0(1.6-5.7), 2.3(1.4-3.8), 2.1(1.2-3.6), and 1.8(1.2-2.9); respectively]. Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 infection among Egyptian physicians is relatively high. Smoking, being a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than 10 years are all factors associated with an increased risk of infection. There should be strict application of preventive measures, periodic screening for COVID-19 for early detection and isolation of infected HCWs together with effective vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the performance of the Brazilian Portuguese Nottingham Health Profile in adult growth hormone deficiency and pulmonary hypertension [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a generic measure of perceived distress that has been used widely as an outcome measure in clinical practice and trials. The availability of two Brazilian datasets provided the opportunity to assess the psychometric performance of the NHP in different populations - adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The purpose of the study was to see how valuable the NHP could be in assessing outcomes in diseases where no disease-specific measures are available. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed with NHP data. Patients diagnosed with adult GHD or PH were administered the NHP during clinic visits on two occasions, two weeks apart. A disease-specific measure of quality of life (QoL) was also administered to the relevant sample of patients on each occasion. Results: The psychometric properties of the NHP were good for both disease groups. As expected, both samples reported high scores on energy level, the PH sample scored high on physical functioning and the GHD sample on emotional reactions. For both samples, most of the NHP sections were able to distinguish between groups of respondents with different ratings of perceived general health. While most sections of the NHP were relatively highly correlated with the QoL measures, pain and sleep did not seem to be important predictors of QoL in either of the samples. Conclusions: The use of the NHP in adult GHD and PH populations in Brazil is not recommended as there are high-quality disease-specific measures available for each disease. However, where no disease-specific measures are available, the NHP can provide good descriptive information of the impact of disease on different patient populations.

                Background: The scientific research into the varied factors that influence cricket performance has become a focal area for overall improved performance. Although there has been documented evidence for both anthropometry and physical fitness among elite cricketers, there is a paucity of evidence among the club cricket cohort. This pilot study aims to evaluate the anthropometric and fitness measurements among a pilot sample of university club cricketers (n = 17; 9 batsmen and 8 bowlers) in South Africa. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from the university’s male first cricket team of the 2019/2020 season. The data included both anthropometric (height, body mass, and body mass index) and physical fitness (explosive power, strength, Yo-Yo, speed and agility) parameters. The results exhibited for every parameter were presented according to height categories and player positions (batsman and bowler). Student t-tests were performed to determine the differences between fitness and anthropometric variables among both height categories and player positions. All data were analysed using SPSS (Version 26, IBM). The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The results indicated significant differences for height categories with regards to stature (p = 0.000) and agility (p = 0.03). Significant differences were also evident for different player positions with regards to body fat percentage (p = 0.02) and vertical jump distance (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study indicated that cricketers who are shorter in stature are less superior with regards to anthropometric and fitness capabilities than their taller counterparts. In addition to being aware of the variances that exist for anthropometry, stature and fitness among cricketers at any level; this study provides implications for both coaches and sports scientists at the club level (under-researched level) in terms of how this can translate to player performances in accordance to height categories and player positions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A case of tuberculosis lymphadenitis mimicking a gastric tumor [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Solitary tuberculosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a rare pathology that usually mimics the clinical and radiological features of malignant tumors. A gastric subepithelial tumor is usually detected during diagnostic endoscopy. Stomach tuberculosis, in particular, can appear as a subepithelial tumor of the stomach wall. Several cases of gastric tuberculosis imitating subepithelial gastric tumors have been reported recently. We describe the case of a patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis that mimics a submucosal gastric tumor. A 52-year-old female was admitted to our surgical department for epigastric pain and weight loss. Endoscopy was inconclusive; it revealed either a submucosal compression or an anterior submucosal lesion with erosive anterior gastropathy and a fistulous orifice located in the bulb. The patient was diagnosed with a gastric tumor and an endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a rounded hypoechogenic antral lesion that was not vascularized and was distant from the gastric wall, whose five layers appeared of a normal aspect. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A biopsy was sent intraoperatively for frozen section examination, and concluded that the diagnosis was tuberculous intraperitoneal lymphadenitis. The patient received anti-tuberculosis treatment. This case demonstrates that gastric tuberculosis remains a challenging diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Models of heterogeneous dopamine signaling in an insect learning and memory center</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Linnie Jiang, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body exhibits dopamine dependent synaptic plasticity that underlies the acquisition of associative memories. Recordings of dopamine neurons in this system have identified signals related to external reinforcement such as reward and punishment. However, other factors including locomotion, novelty, reward expectation, and internal state have also recently been shown to modulate dopamine neurons. This heterogeneity is at odds with typical modeling approaches in which these neurons are assumed to encode a global, scalar error signal. How is dopamine dependent plasticity coordinated in the presence of such heterogeneity? We develop a modeling approach that infers a pattern of dopamine activity sufficient to solve defined behavioral tasks, given architectural constraints informed by knowledge of mushroom body circuitry. Model dopamine neurons exhibit diverse tuning to task parameters while nonetheless producing coherent learned behaviors. Notably, reward prediction error emerges as a mode of population activity distributed across these neurons. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that accounts for the heterogeneity of dopamine activity during learning and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Trip duration drives shift in travel network structure with implications for the predictability of spatial disease spread</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John R. Giles, Derek AT Cummings, Bryan T. Grenfell, Andrew J. Tatem, Elisabeth zu Erbach-Schoenberg, CJE Metcalf, Amy Wesolowski</p>

Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread. Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Tooth morphology elucidates shark evolution across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohamad Bazzi, Nicolás E. Campione, Per E. Ahlberg, Henning Blom, Benjamin P. Kear</p>

Sharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their prolific fossil record is represented mainly by isolated shed teeth, which provide the basis for reconstructing deep time diversity changes affecting different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding shifts in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine tooth morphologies in multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction—this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Our results show that selachimorphs maintained virtually static levels of dental disparity in most of their constituent clades across the Cretaceous–Paleogene interval. Nevertheless, selective extinctions did impact apex predator species characterized by triangular blade-like teeth. This is particularly evident among lamniforms, which included the dominant Cretaceous anacoracids. Conversely, other groups, such as carcharhiniforms and orectolobiforms, experienced disparity modifications, while heterodontiforms, hexanchiforms, squaliforms, squatiniforms, and †synechodontiforms were not overtly affected. Finally, while some lamniform lineages disappeared, others underwent postextinction disparity increases, especially odontaspidids, which are typified by narrow-cusped teeth adapted for feeding on fishes. Notably, this increase coincides with the early Paleogene radiation of teleosts as a possible prey source, and the geographic relocation of disparity sampling “hotspots,” perhaps indicating a regionally disjunct extinction recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals a complex morphological response to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction and highlights an event that influenced the evolution of modern sharks.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lewy Body–like Inclusions in Human Midbrain Organoids Carrying Glucocerebrosidase and α‐Synuclein Mutations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We utilized human midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs) generated from human pluripotent stem cells carrying glucocerebrosidase gene (<i>GBA1)</i> and α-synuclein (α-syn; <i>SNCA)</i> perturbations to investigate genotype-to-phenotype relationships in Parkinson disease, with the particular aim of recapitulating α-syn– and Lewy body–related pathologies and the process of neurodegeneration in the hMLO model.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated and characterized hMLOs from <i>GBA1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> and <i>SNCA</i> overexpressing isogenic embryonic stem cells and also generated Lewy body–like inclusions in <i>GBA1/SNCA</i> dual perturbation hMLOs and conduritol-b-epoxide–treated <i>SNCA</i> triplication hMLOs.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified for the first time that the loss of glucocerebrosidase, coupled with wild-type α-syn overexpression, results in a substantial accumulation of detergent-resistant, β-sheet–rich α-syn aggregates and Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs. These Lewy body–like inclusions exhibit a spherically symmetric morphology with an eosinophilic core, containing α-syn with ubiquitin, and can also be formed in Parkinson disease patient–derived hMLOs. We also demonstrate that impaired glucocerebrosidase function promotes the formation of Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs derived from patients carrying the <i>SNCA</i> triplication.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, the data indicate that our hMLOs harboring 2 major risk factors (glucocerebrosidase deficiency and wild-type α-syn overproduction) of Parkinson disease provide a tractable model to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms for progressive Lewy body formation.

<p>LDT–VTA inputs optogenetic manipulation changes motivational drive and modifies preference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem nucleus classically involved in REM sleep and attention, and that has recently been associated with reward-related behaviors, as it controls the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, modulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. To further understand the role of LDT–VTA inputs in reinforcement, we optogenetically manipulated these inputs during different behavioral paradigms in male rats. We found that in a two-choice instrumental task, optical activation of LDT–VTA projections shifts and amplifies preference to the laser-paired reward in comparison to an otherwise equal reward; the opposite was observed with inhibition experiments. In a progressive ratio task, LDT–VTA activation boosts motivation, that is, enhances the willingness to work to get the reward associated with LDT–VTA stimulation; and the reverse occurs when inhibiting these inputs. Animals abolished preference if the reward was omitted, suggesting that LDT–VTA stimulation adds/decreases value to the stimulation-paired reward. In addition, we show that LDT–VTA optical activation induces robust preference in the conditioned and real-time place preference tests, while optical inhibition induces aversion. The behavioral findings are supported by electrophysiological recordings and c-fos immunofluorescence correlates in downstream target regions. In LDT–VTA ChR2 animals, we observed an increase in the recruitment of lateral VTA dopamine neurons and D1 neurons from nucleus accumbens core and shell; whereas in LDT–VTA NpHR animals, D2 neurons appear to be preferentially recruited. Collectively, these data show that the LDT–VTA inputs encode positive reinforcement signals and are important for different dimensions of reward-related behaviors.</p>

     alt="Does attentional focus modulate affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits?"/>
<p>This study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in incarcerated violent offenders with psychopathic traits as compared to controls. Findings reveal no abnormal early responses in offenders but suggest specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antisocial and psychopathic individuals are characterized by a reduced responsivity to affective information. Yet, the role of attentional processes as possible modulator of these deficits is poorly understood. The current study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in a sample of incarcerated offenders while manipulating the attentional focus. Twenty-seven male violent offenders with psychopathic traits and 27 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task, while Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. EEG data indicated no differences in early stage processing (early posterior negativity) between the experimental groups. However, we found significant group differences with regard to the late processing stage (late positive potential, LPP). Controls showed increased LPP amplitudes in Task 2 as compared to Task 1, indicating that task demands (i.e., attentional focus) had an effect on the processing of the emotional stimuli. In contrast, LPP amplitudes in the violent offender group were largely unaffected by task demands, suggesting specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli. In sum, this study provides new evidence for a modulatory impact of attention on affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits.</p>

                Using a modern machine learning approach, we show that the I/O characteristics of cortical pyramidal neurons can be approximated, at the millisecond resolution (single spike precision), by a temporally convolutional neural network with five to eight layers. This computational complexity stems mainly from the interplay between NMDA receptors and dendritic morphology.

                Tan et al. show that the majority of LIN28 binding sites are found on non-miRNA transcripts like coding and ribosomal RNA. Binding to non-miRNA sites sequesters LIN28 protein and competitively inhibits the regulation of miRNAs. Non-miRNA sites can thus modulate the strength of cellular miRNA activity in cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Actinin BioID reveals sarcomere crosstalk with oxidative metabolism through interactions with IGF2BP2</a></h4>

              
                Ladha et al. combine BioID, human cardiomyocytes, and CRISPR-Cas9 to interrogate the actinin interactome. This reveals 324 actinin proximity partners, including RNA-binding proteins that bind transcripts encoding ETC functional components. Among these RNA-binding proteins, IGF2BP2 directly binds actinin, and actinin-IGF2BP2 interactions regulate ETC transcript localization and metabolic adaptation to sarcomere function.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">GDF15 mediates the metabolic effects of PPARβ/δ by activating AMPK</a></h4>

              
                GDF15 is a stress response cytokine that regulates energy metabolism. Aguilar-Recarte et al. show that PPARβ/δ activation increases GDF15 levels, which contributes to the metabolic effect of this receptor and activates AMPK in skeletal muscle independently of GDF15 receptor GFRAL.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A transepithelial pathway delivers succinate to macrophages, thus perpetuating their pro-inflammatory metabolic state</a></h4>

              
                Succinate is emerging as a prominent pro-inflammatory metabolite. Fremder et al. show that transporter-mediated succinate uptake into macrophages is elevated to enhance and perpetuate inflammation. In IBD, high succinate metabolized by distinct gut bacteria may cause chronic inflammation. Hence, this pathway is a potential therapeutic target to treat inflammatory diseases.

                Wang et al. report that NAD+ biosynthesis through the TCR-PLCγ-TUB-NAMPT-mediated salvage pathway is important for T cell activation. Metabolically, NAD+ deficiency causes defects in aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. NAD+ supplementation rescues these defects and enhances the tumor-killing efficacy of T cells in both CAR-T and anti-PD1 mouse models.
