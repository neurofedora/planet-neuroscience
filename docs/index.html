              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-83/v2?src=rss">Is rationality a cognitive faculty? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Rationality in the standard (economics) sense cannot be a form of intelligence or any other cognitive faculty, such as memory, language, or mathematical skills. To establish this thesis, this paper uses a distinction from set theory, namely, the distinction between “binary relators” and “binary operators”. Rationality, in the standard sense, acts as a binary relator in the sense that it is an optimization method, whereas cognitive ability acts as a binary operator in the sense that it is a transformational function. Rationality as an optimization method (binary relator) does not differ from the neo-Darwinian notion of natural selection: either method seeks to find the best choice or fit trait given the constraints. A cognitive faculty as a transformational function (binary operator) simply translates inputs into outputs. The distinction between standard rationality and cognitive functions has wide-ranging implications for the theory of evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08847">Data-driven spatiotemporal modeling reveals personalized trajectories of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of pathology across brain networks, yet forecasting this cascade at the individual level remains challenging. We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09243">Characterizing sleep stages through the complexity-entropy plane in human intracranial data and in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09506">A thermoinformational framework for the description of neuropsychological systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a statistical thermodynamics-inspired framework that summarizes multichannel EEG and behavior using macroscopic state variables (entropy, internal energy, temperature, Helmholtz free energy) to quantify stability and reconfiguration in neuropsychological systems. Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Together, these findings show that the thermoinformational framework yields compact, physically grounded descriptors that hold in both human and mouse datasets studied here.

                arXiv:2511.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

                arXiv:2509.02139v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11477">Fractal geometry predicts dynamic differences in structural and functional connectomes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease. While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis. We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.

                arXiv:2507.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.

                arXiv:2511.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.

                arXiv:2511.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540">Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05540v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

                arXiv:2511.08653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

                arXiv:2511.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs. The source code is available at https://github.com/AwesomeLemon/IPBT.

                arXiv:2511.09416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14951">Flat Channels to Infinity in Neural Loss Landscapes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

                arXiv:2507.22787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis demonstrate that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model: it exhibits a memory capacity that grows linearly with connectivity, a persistent spectral gap separating stored patterns from noise, and significantly enlarged basins of attraction. These results show that geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure yield associative memories with markedly enhanced stability and retrieval performance.

                arXiv:2511.07836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.

                <p>Diverse network oscillations, thought to represent different information processing modes of cortical networks, are accompanied by synchronous neuronal activity at various temporal scales. Sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, supporting memory consolidation in the hippocampus, are among the fastest physiological oscillations characterized by strong interneuronal synchrony. In contrast, when hippocampal activity turns epileptic, pathological fast-ripple oscillations appear. The distinction of the two oscillations is diagnostically relevant; however, how differential mechanisms of the same network generate the two activities is not well understood. Here we addressed this question using an in vitro hippocampal model that allowed targeted recording of cell types and local pharmacological manipulations in mice of either sex. We showed that inhibition did not contribute to current and rhythm generation of fast-ripples, unlike physiological ripple oscillations. Instead, pathological fast-ripples emerged when perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells collapsed and depended on the quasi-simultaneous onset of stereotypical pyramidal cell (PC) bursts leading to pseudosynchrony. This was accompanied by a loss of spatial coherence. In epileptogenic conditions, deep CA3 PCs selectively ramped up their burst activity before fast-ripple onset, while normally nonbursting superficial PCs acquired burst capability. These results point to PC pseudosynchrony as the underlying mechanism of fast-ripples, with differential contribution of known PC types.</p>

                <p>Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 males, 20 females) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudorandom intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including the heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340&ndash;356&nbsp;ms window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal&mdash;a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.</p>

This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat and the related "periodized" neural representation are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex. The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15&nbsp;Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior. In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25&nbsp;Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization and yielded less stable tapping. Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat. Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses. More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.</p>

                <p>Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates postsynaptic strength to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling. Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling in cultured rat neurons of either sex. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Furthermore, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3 and thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluRs that are necessary for upscaling. Altogether, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling is thought to require agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up- and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.</p>

                <p>The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex&mdash;especially in primates&mdash;underpins the emergence of advanced cognitive abilities. This process involved not only increased cortical surface area and neuronal output but also enhanced structural adaptations, such as cortical folding and glial morphological complexity. In this review, we examine the central roles of radial glia (RG) and astrocytes in driving neocortical expansion and evolution. We highlight the emergence of primate- and human-specific genes, which contribute to enhanced RG proliferation and neurogenesis in these species. We further explore how epigenetic regulation and dynamic chromatin architecture modulate RG behavior across species. At the cellular level, we discuss how morphological features&mdash;particularly the basal processes and specialized protrusions of RG&mdash;facilitate access to diverse extrinsic signals, promoting proliferative capacity and cortical complexity. We then turn to cortical folding, focusing on the role of astrocytes, and the functional relevance of folds in supporting brain homeostasis. Finally, we address astrocyte diversity, development, and evolutionary adaptation, with special emphasis on sex differences and primate-specific features. Comparative transcriptomic and morphological studies reveal that human astrocytes exhibit unique molecular signatures, expanded metabolic capacity, and higher morphological complexity. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted contributions of RG and astrocytes to the evolutionary elaboration of the neocortex. They further provide a framework for understanding how cellular innovations shaped the modern primate brain in general, and human brain specifically.</p>

                <p>The ventral hippocampus (vHPC), initially implicated in anxiety regulation, is now recognized for its broader role in integrating emotional, motivational, and contextual information. This review synthesizes recent insights from rodent research presented at our 2025 Society for Neuroscience minisymposium, detailing how local inhibitory microcircuits, long-range projection&ndash;defined pathways, and neuromodulatory inputs interact to shape fear, anxiety, and reward behaviors. We emphasize how distinct circuits segregate fear and anxiety, resolve approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, and integrate reward history. Serotonergic modulation, particularly from the median raphe, emerges as a critical regulator of vHPC dynamics, with pronounced sex-specific functional implications. Finally, we examine how vCA1 ensemble activity encodes emotionally salient stimuli and supports latent state inference, thereby enabling flexible decision-making under uncertainty. Collectively, these findings recast the vHPC as a modular, computationally rich structure essential for adaptive behavior, which may provide new insights into circuit-level dysfunction in affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Pain is a symptom common to a wide variety of conditions and one that severely impacts an individual's everyday life, as well as having broader socioeconomic repercussions. In recent years, there has been spectacularly rapid progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of sensory neuron function and pain in preclinical models. However, the number of analgesics interacting with novel targets that have received regulatory approval in recent years has been limited. Examples include monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies disrupting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling for treating migraine and, most recently, suzetrigine, a small molecular inhibitor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8 subunit. In this review, we step away from focusing on the sensory neuron as the transmitter of nociceptive information and examine the role of non-neuronal cells in modulating sensory neuron activity. One potential appeal of disrupting the activity of peripherally located non-neuronal cells is the likely bypassing of side effects associated with modulating a target receptor that is expressed by neurons within both the peripheral and central nervous systems, although targeting of peripheral, non-neuronal cells will not of course necessarily be side effect-free. Here, we examine the key roles of non-neuronal cells in orchestrating pain across a diverse set of conditions, from joint pain to bone pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, Fabry disease, and chronic pain in general.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is essential for monitoring ongoing behavior, regulating affect, and guiding social interactions. Altered ACC structure and function are implicated in a host of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder. Thus, cross talk between basic and translational research is needed to drive the next generation of treatments. The human and nonhuman primate ACC is large and can be subdivided based on anatomical structure and connectivity. Increasingly, studies of the ACC point to unique functions for its distinct areas. This review highlights recent work aimed at understanding of the structure and function of distinct portions of the ACC and the role of these regions in cognition and affect in higher species. We focus on the roles and subregions that might guide the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. This includes discussion of in-depth anatomical investigations that have revealed that distinct portions of the subgenual and perigenual ACC areas are driven by unique afferent paths. Furthermore, we describe neurophysiological recordings of single-neuron and local field potential activity, combined with carefully designed behavioral tasks or novel approaches to discerning affective states, which have revealed the neural mechanisms engaged in ACC during affective experience and assessment of conspecifics. We present noninvasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches that target the ACC to treat depression and have been shown to be most effective when they change activity within subgenual parts of ACC and may structurally remodel the connections of this area. Finally, we review new approaches to uncover upstream drivers and downstream effectors of ACC activity in higher species, including functional changes implicated in health, disease, and recovery.</p>

                <p>Successful navigation and interactions with objects in a complex, three-dimensional (3D) world are essential to survival, yet studies of the neural basis of visual perception and action often treat the world as a flat, two-dimensional (2D) canvas. Here, we review recent discoveries about how the visual systems of different mammals have adapted under the constraint of a 3D world. Many neurons in primate visual cortex are sensitive to 3D depth cues constructed from input differences to the two eyes (binocular disparities). Similar neuronal selectivity has recently been characterized in tree shrews and mice, though constrained anatomically and functionally. Disparity-sensitive receptive field structures can now be assessed noninvasively across human visual cortex and functionally linked to depth perception. At later stages in the nonhuman primate (NHP) ventral ("what") pathway, supporting object recognition, complex 3D objects are represented as spatial configurations of geometric parts. In studies of the dorsal ("where"/"how") pathway of NHPs, underlying visuospatial processing, the inclusion of 3D structure in visual tasks has established tighter links between neuronal mechanisms and perception. This has also revealed neuronal representations of 3D object position and orientation that are tolerant to 3D gaze location, providing a basis for robust perception and action. The cross-species analysis presented here provides new perspectives on neural coding mechanisms underpinning the richness of 3D visual experience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential for understanding the neural basis of cognition and behavior, which in turn will enable the development of therapies and neuroprosthetics for those suffering from visual impairments.</p>

                <p>The visual system is a complex hierarchical structure that processes diverse visual information to guide cognition and behavior. Elucidating the principles that govern the development and function of the visual system's circuitry is a central goal in visual neuroscience. This review examines connectivity, computation, and plasticity within the early mammalian visual system, focusing on three key structures: the retina, the superior colliculus (SC), and the primary visual cortex (V1). The retina serves as the initial site for visual information processing, culminating in activation of highly selective retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which convey all visual information to the brain. The SC is a primary retinorecipient region that integrates visual information to guide appropriate behavioral responses, exhibiting visual processing both similar to and distinct from RGCs. Retinal information is also relayed via the thalamus to V1, which extracts detailed visual features through spatial and temporal integration, forming the basis of conscious visual perception. The development of these structures involves a coarse-to-fine maturation of functional networks driven by intrinsic mechanisms, including molecular cues and spontaneous patterns of activity. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity in the SC and V1 allows the visual system to adapt to changes of sensory inputs during development. Recent work has significantly advanced our understanding of the complex neuronal computations executed in these early visual regions and the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying development and plasticity. This knowledge has significant implications for both basic neuroscience and clinical applications, particularly in the context of visual system disorders.</p>

However, recent experimental and computational modeling studies have revealed a new form of synaptic plasticity termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP).

                <p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) affect millions annually, leading to devastating neurobehavioral consequences and increasing risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. However, therapies are lacking. Starting in 2018, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome was identified as an acute, and potentially chronic, pathology originating from TBI. Recent studies established that the microbiome contributes to the evolution of TBI pathology and functional impairments. The gut microbiome is the collection of microorganisms that inhabit the stomach through colon and is indicated as a contributor to myriad neurological and psychiatric conditions. This makes it an intriguing target to understand in the context of TBI. Thus, this review focuses on the evidence establishing the gut as a modulator of TBI and the major potential mechanisms by which this occurs. This includes regulation of food processing into host-usable nutrients, inflammatory signaling, and vagus nerve modulation. Each of these areas provides potential for future therapeutic development and intervention but there are also multiple areas where microbiome-TBI science could be improved.</p>

                <p>Perception and action are deeply intertwined processes that require the nervous system to distinguish between self-generated (reafferent) and externally generated (exafferent) sensory inputs. To maintain accurate perception during movement, the brain must attenuate predictable sensory consequences of its own actions while remaining sensitive to unexpected external events. Reafference attenuation is a temporally precise process that suppresses expected feedback, facilitating the detection of novel stimuli. This review examines reafference attenuation across species (rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans) and sensory systems (vestibular, auditory, and tactile). We also discuss sensory gating (or sensory suppression), a broader and often less selective mechanism that inhibits both self- and externally generated inputs. Although both mechanisms reduce sensory inflow during movement, they differ in function, specificity, and temporal dynamics, and despite growing insight into their underlying circuitry, important questions remain about their generality and implementation.</p>

                <p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse essential for effective motor neuron&ndash;muscle communication and is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable site in aging and neuromuscular disease. While traditionally considered a final common pathway for motor deficits, accumulating evidence demonstrates that NMJ dysfunction is an early and critical driver of disease onset and progression in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot&ndash;Marie&ndash;Tooth disease. This review highlights shared and disease-specific mechanisms contributing to NMJ impairment, including presynaptic, postsynaptic, and perisynaptic Schwann cell defects in these diseases. We also discuss age-related changes at the NMJ, emphasizing its role in sarcopenia and muscle weakness in older adults. Furthermore, we explore emerging molecular drivers of NMJ dysfunction uncovered through studies in congenital myasthenic syndromes, autoimmune disorders, and advanced omics approaches. By integrating insights across diseases and aging, we underscore the potential for shared therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing NMJ function. Promising interventions targeting presynaptic neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic excitability, and perisynaptic Schwann cells are discussed as avenues to improve neuromuscular transmission and maintain muscle strength. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in translating these mechanistic insights into clinical therapies and highlight how novel human neuromuscular organoid models and advanced molecular profiling can bridge this gap. Together, these insights establish the NMJ as a critical, modifiable target for preserving motor function across neuromuscular diseases and aging.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for our ability to rapidly and flexibly adapt our behavior in new environments based on our previous experience. Despite its importance, the neural substrates and mechanisms by which the PFC supports this function have long remained enigmatic. Recent advances, however, have begun to change this. An increasingly large body of work suggests the PFC represents structured relationships&mdash;both among states of the outside world and between internally generated actions. In this review, we describe work from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans to draw attention to the breadth of such representations and how they support flexible behavior. Across species, the PFC appears to represent the relational structure of problems: how stimuli relate to one another in cognitive maps or how different behaviors relate to one another when pursuing a goal. These results have started to reveal shared computational principles for PFC that generalize from rodents to humans and have inspired formal computational models and simulations. By reviewing experimental work showing both correlation and causation through invasive and noninvasive methods, along with theoretical work using artificial neural networks, we aim to highlight similarities and differences between species and models to provide a common language for interpreting findings in PFC. This will move us closer to a mechanistic understanding of the PFC that scales across tasks and species.</p>

                <p>Down syndrome (DS) is a common and recognizable genetic condition. Altered neurodevelopmental programs caused by trisomy 21 lead to the hallmark intellectual disability in early life. The increased lifespan of individuals with DS in the latter half of the twentieth century revealed the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) earlier and with a higher prevalence in individuals with DS than in the general population. Thus, neuropathology in DS progresses along a continuum from prenatal disruptions to the manifestations of age-related conditions and AD. This review discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms of altered neurodevelopment and the precocious onset of AD in DS. We highlight the gaps in our understanding of how neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration are linked and describe how advancements in molecular technology and computational modeling are revealing molecular neuropathology in DS across the lifespan.</p>

                <p>First discovered by Golgi, perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrices that surround various neuron types in the nervous system. They have been found to emerge at the end of developmental critical periods and serve as "molecular brakes" on plasticity. Perineuronal nets have traditionally been studied in the context of sensory and cognitive plasticity, but recent studies extend their contributions to brain plasticity involved in substance use disorders, metabolism, neurodegeneration, and more. This review will summarize recent discoveries about the functions of PNNs across diverse circuits, contexts, and species, across different stages of life, and between disease and nondisease states and will integrate fundamental and clinical studies to identify conserved and novel functions of PNNs. Given the recent map of extensive PNN expression, we hope to encourage investigators researching diverse neural systems to examine PNN contributions to circuit function and behavior.</p>

                <p>Although adenosine was identified in the brain many decades ago, our understanding of when, where, and how it functions has expanded rapidly in recent years, driven in part by innovative technological advances. Adenosine is now increasingly recognized as a key neuromodulator that dynamically regulates brain circuits important for sleep/wakefulness, movement, cognition, and homeostasis. In addition, growing attention has been directed toward the molecular mechanisms governing adenosine production and its downstream signaling pathways, both of which hold great promise as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights recent progress in detecting adenosine, unraveling its signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo, and understanding how it regulates brain function under physiological and pathological conditions.</p>

Recent genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have highlighted astrocytes as key players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, important questions remain unanswered: How are astrocyte functions changed across different neurodegenerative disorders? Does astrocyte reactivity contribute to neurodegenerative cascades? Can astrocyte-specific processes be targeted for therapy? This review summarizes recent findings on the potential contribution of astrocytes to disease onset and progression, with a focus on their therapeutic potential. It also explores the application of advanced omics technologies to unravel astrocyte complexity, along with the use of emerging murine models and human-induced pluripotent stem cells based systems to explore astrocyte involvement in disease mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the major lipid transport protein in the brain. Produced primarily by astrocytes and microglia, it delivers cholesterol and other lipids for membrane repair, synaptic maintenance, and immune regulation. Through interactions with specific lipid receptors, APOE maintains neuronal and vascular health. The <I>APOE</I> 4 allele (APOE4), carried by approximately one-quarter of the population, has an altered protein conformation, which reduces lipid transport efficiency and modifies receptor binding. These changes disrupt lipid homeostasis, increase risk of chronic unresolved neuroinflammation and vascular inflammation, and cause breakdown of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), thus increasing neuronal vulnerability to disease pathology and elevating risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we organize the effects of APOE4 into three interconnected "hits" that modulate disease progression: disrupted lipid handling, neurovascular inflammation, and neuronal dysfunction. These interconnected hits help explain why amyloid- and tau-directed therapies alone have modest success in treating AD, particularly in APOE4 carriers. We review emerging APOE-related therapeutic strategies designed to address these mechanisms directly, including structure correctors to restore normal protein folding, agents that enhance lipidation and receptor-mediated lipid transport, approaches that modulate downstream inflammatory responses, and gene therapies aimed at isoform switching or allele silencing. By aligning therapeutic strategies with specific aspects of APOE4 biology, such approaches have the potential to provide broader and safer benefits, complement existing disease-modifying therapies, and improve outcomes for individuals at heightened genetic risk of AD.</p>

However, more recent findings argue that decisions emerge from distributed, recurrent computations across many brain areas (a "heterarchy") with complex, heterogeneous representations. How can we make sense of these findings in a way that preserves the computational elegance of the conventional view? In this review, we describe how a new generation of studies is leveraging high-density electrophysiology, incisive task designs, causal manipulations (e.g., optogenetics) and statistical approaches for probing inter-area communication, and theoretical methods that connect population dynamics with representational geometry to build a modern framework for understanding perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>During development, inner hair cells (IHCs) in the mammalian cochlea are unresponsive to acoustic stimuli but instead exhibit spontaneous activity. During this same period, neurons originating from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) complex transiently innervate IHCs, regulating their firing pattern which is crucial for the correct development of the auditory pathway. Although the MOC-IHC is a cholinergic synapse, previous evidence indicates the widespread presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling markers, including presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R). In this study, we explore the source of GABA by optogenetically activating either cholinergic or GABAergic fibers. The optogenetic stimulation of MOC terminals from GAD;ChR2-eYFP and ChAT;ChR2-eYFP mice (of either sex) evoked synaptic currents in IHCs, which were blocked by &alpha;-bungarotoxin. This suggests that GABAergic fibers release acetylcholine (ACh) and activate &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Additionally, MOC cholinergic fibers release not only ACh but also GABA, as the effect of GABA on ACh response amplitude was prevented by applying a GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R blocker. Using optical neurotransmitter detection and calcium imaging techniques, we examined the extent of GABAergic modulation at the single synapse level. Our findings suggest heterogeneity in GABA modulation, as only 15 out of 31 recorded synaptic sites were modulated by applying the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R specific antagonist, CGP 35348 (100&ndash;200&nbsp;&micro;M). In conclusion, we provide evidence indicating that GABA and ACh are co-released from at least a subset of MOC terminals. In this circuit, GABA functions as a negative feedback mechanism, locally regulating the extent of cholinergic inhibition at certain efferent-&gt;IHC synapses during an immature stage.</p>

                <p>Social animals compete for rewards to survive, yet the neural circuits underlying reward-based social competition remain unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in reward processing and social dominance, but whether its subregions contribute differently to competitions for reward remains unknown. Using c-Fos mapping in male CD1 mice, we examined reward-induced neural activation in mPFC subregions and key interconnected subcortical areas across social and nonsocial reward contexts. Noncompetitive social contexts produced global c-Fos activation relative to competitive contexts. Cross-regional correlation analyses revealed that receiving rewards in isolation involved widespread network coordination, while social contexts exhibited distinct, sparse correlation patterns. Surprisingly, social rank effects on neural activity were most pronounced during isolated reward experiences rather than during competition, with dominant mice showing increased anterior cingulate, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampal activation when alone. Different dominance ranks (reward-based, territorial, and agonistic) correlated with distinct neural activity patterns across contexts. Overall, our results show that social context fundamentally reorganizes prefrontal&ndash;subcortical networks during reward processing in a social rank-dependent manner. These results provide new insights into how social rank shapes the neural basis of reward processing across different social contexts.</p>

                Background The theory of Observational Relativity (OR), as a new theory in human-developed physics, has revealed the essence of the relativistic effects of Einstein theory of relativity, and moreover, has generalized and unified Newton’s classical mechanics and Einstein’s relativity theory. However, the original intention of OR research is not to establish the theory of OR, but to give photons a little rest mass. According to Einstein special relativity, an object of matter moving in inertial spacetime has two types of mass: the rest mass; the moving mass. However, Einstein claimed that photons had no the rest mass. In fact, the moving mass depends on observation and is not objectively real. So, photons would have no mass if they had no the rest mass. Methods According to the materialist view of nature, the natural world is a world of matter, and all matter or material particles, including photons, have the objectively intrinsic mass. Naturally, the objectively real mass must be independent of observation. OR serial report 1 has elucidate the theoretical validity and empirical basis of OR. Now, OR serial report 2 will report the logical consequence of OR: photons have the rest mass. Results The theory of Inertial OR (IOR) has theoretically proved that photons possess the rest mass; the theory of Gravitational OR (GOR) has theoretically calculated and predicted that the rest mass of a photon with the frequency f is mo = hf/c 2. Conclusions The logical consequence that photons has the rest mass are in line with the materialist view of nature: all matter or material particles must possess the objectively real mass; an object of matter, whether it is a massive star or a tiny photon, must possess the rest mass of its own if it exists objectively; otherwise, it does not exist.

                <p>by Lin Yuan, Boyuan Meng, Qingxiang Wang, Chunyu Hu, Cuihong Wang, De-Shuang Huang</p>

The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) has made it possible to effectively integrate gene expression and spatial information of cells and accurately identify spatial domains. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to perform spatial domain identification and achieved impressive results. However, these methods have some limitations. First, these methods rely on a fixed similarity metric and cannot fully utilize neighborhood information. Second, they cannot efficiently and adaptively integrate key information when fusing and reconstructing gene expression using purely additive methods. Finally, these methods ignore key nonlinear features and introduce noise during clustering. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DL model SpaMWGDA based on multi-view weighted fused graph convolutional network (GCN) and data augmentation. By modeling spatial information using different similarity metrics, the model is able to successfully capture comprehensive neighborhood information of the spot features. By combining data augmentation and contrastive learning, SpaMWGDA is able to learn key gene expressions. SpaMWGDA uses a multi-view GCN encoder to model the similarities between spatial information and gene features, and uses a view-level attention mechanism for weighted fusion to adaptively learn the dependencies between them and learn the key features of each view. Experimental results not only demonstrate that SpaMWGDA outperforms competing methods in spatial domain identification and trajectory inference but also show the ability of SpaMWGDA to analyse tissue structure and function. The source code for SpaMWGDA is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/SpaMWGDA .

                <p>by Quentin Bateux, Jonathan Koss, Patrick W. Sweeney, Erika Edwards, Nelson Rios, Aaron M. Dollar</p>

The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern “deep learning” machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the “confidence” that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow biologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.

                <p>by P. Catalina Chaparro-Pedraza, Claudia Bank</p>

To what extent is biodiversity shaped by environmental conditions, and to what extent is it the result of self-organization? Both natural processes and organismal properties may contribute to promoting diversity. Here, we show that one such process, namely natural selection, and an organismal property, namely life history, interact in a feedback mechanism that promotes the emergence of diversity. We illustrate how this mechanism operates using various models of ecological diversification driven by intraspecific resource competition, in which both a niche trait that determines resource use and a life history trait can evolve. We find that natural selection acting on life history traits leads to increased competition, which, in the presence of ecological opportunity, facilitates niche diversification. As a consequence, the environmental conditions for diversification are more restrictive in the absence of life history evolution than in its presence. Our findings indicate a strong influence of life history evolution on ecological processes that in turn shape the origin of biodiversity. Our results call for a better integration of life history evolution and niche diversification in both theoretical and empirical realms.

                <p>by Tahnée Engelen, Teresa Schuhmann, Alexander T. Sack, Catherine Tallon-Baudry</p>

Interoception refers to the brain’s sensing of internal body state and encompasses various bodily systems, notably the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. Beyond their roles in physiological regulation and emotional states, each of these visceral rhythms has been shown to influence brain activity and cognition, prompting for the development of various interpretative functional frameworks. However, both experimental data and functional hypothesis leave it unclear whether and how each visceral rhythm acts simultaneously and independently on brain activity. Here, we address this question by measuring in human participants how the corticospinal excitability of the motor system varies with the phase of each of the three visceral rhythms. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand region in primary motor cortex to elicit Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), whose amplitude reflects corticospinal excitability, and tested whether MEP amplitude depends on the phase of the simultaneously measured cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. All three visceral rhythms were coupled to motor excitability with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths: participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs. These results indicate that independent mechanisms could underly the coupling between the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms and motor excitability. We further introduce the concept of individual interoceptive profiles and show that such interoceptive profiles obtained from objective coupling strength measures were not explained by self-reported awareness of the organ. Altogether, our results call for refined specifications of the frameworks offering a functional or clinical interpretation of viscera–brain coupling taking into account both independent mechanisms and individual interoceptive profiles.

                <p>by Pierre-Yves Barelle, Fabienne Schaller, Soyoung Park, Emilie Caron, Jessica Klucznik, Phillipe Ciofi, Françoise Muscatelli, Sebastien G. Bouret</p>

The hypothalamus is crucial for regulating essential bodily functions, including energy balance. It is an exceedingly complex and heterogeneous brain region that contains a variety of neuronal systems that are interconnected with each other. Among these, the melanocortin system, which comprises pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, displays a remarkable anatomical relationship with oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVH). Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons are instrumental in the development of the melanocortin system in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of OT neurons during the first postnatal week selectively disrupts POMC and AgRP projections to the PVH, without affecting other target nuclei like the dorsomedial nucleus. This developmental role is age-dependent, as silencing OT neurons in juvenile or adult stages has no impact on melanocortin circuits. OT neurons release various neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and their secretion can be modulated by chemogenetic manipulation. Expressing the botulinum toxin serotype B light chain in OT neurons reveals that their developmental actions rely on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. Moreover, administering an OT receptor antagonist during the first postnatal week leads to similar melanocortin circuit defects and long-term metabolic effects. Furthermore, neonatal chemogenetic activation of OT neurons rescues POMC circuit deficits in a mouse model of Prader–Willi Syndrome. These findings reveal that OT acts as a paracrine neurotrophic factor orchestrating the development of melanocortin circuits during a restricted neonatal critical period.

                Background The objective of this study was to perform morphometry of the gracilis muscle and understand the topographical basis of the entry of its pedicles. Methods We studied forty-four cadaveric lower extremities fixed in formalin. The length and width of the gracilis were measured at three locations: the origin, midpoint, and musculotendinous junction. The topographic location of the gracilis pedicles was also studied. Results The gracilis muscle’s length was 369.9±34.1 mm and 359.6±29.6 mm over the right and left sides. The width of right gracilis was 25±8.4 mm, 20.4±6.2 mm and 10.6±5.6 mm at the origin, midpoint and at the musculotendinous junction. The same over the left side were 26.7±8.6 mm, 20.6±9.1 mm and 10.4±6.4 mm respectively. The number of gracilis ranged from one to three. The location of first pedicle was 93.6±35.6 mm and 68.9±35.8 mm away from the pubic tubercle on the right and left sides, respectively. The second and third pedicles were entering at a distance of 153.1±38.8 mm and 101.3±20.8 mm, 214.6±86.8 mm and 145.3±124.4 mm over the right side and left side. The accessory head of the origin of the gracilis was observed in only one cadaver (2.3%), which originated from the adductor longus. Conclusions It is believed that the morphological data of the gracilis and its neurovascular pedicles will be enlightening to the operating surgeon. They will guide the procedures for reconstructive plastic surgery.

                Through whole-brain neurovascular imaging in larval zebrafish, Sun and Peng et al. show that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system orchestrates globally patterned pericyte activities through complementary direct NE and indirect glia-relayed actions. Such LC-NE neuron-pericyte coupling exerts global vasoconstrictive drives that coordinate blood flow and support sustained behavioral performance.

                In this work, Vigo et al. demonstrate that norepinephrine (NE) promotes myeloid hematopoiesis in BM and regulates thymic Tregs via B3ARs in EAE. B3ARs are controlled by hypothalamic AgRP neurons, which are dysfunctional in EAE. Serum levels of AgRP are elevated in people with MS and correlate with disease severity.

                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 12 November 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00987-2">doi:10.1038/s41583-025-00987-2</a></p>Understanding how the brain represents experienced time and how representations of space and time are integrated to form episodic memories has been a goal of much neuroscientific research. In this Perspective, Buzsáki discusses classical and contemporary ideas about time perception and proposes that a hierarchy of brain–body rhythms contributes to our subjective experience of time.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101071">Modulation of aperiodic EEG activity provides sensitive index of cognitive state changes during working memory task</a></h4>

              
                To better understand cognitive processes, it is valuable to consider both periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic electrophysiological brain activity. The aim of this study was to clarify how the periodic and aperiodic electrophysiological components reflect the cognitive processes involved in working memory. Fifty-seven human participants performed an n-back task while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The analysis of both components of the EEG spectrum during task performance indicates that both periodic and aperiodic activities exhibit distinct task-related spatiotemporal dynamics that are closely related to cognitive demands. The results suggest that a substantial portion of the changes often attributed to theta oscillations in working memory tasks may be influenced by shifts in the spectral slope of aperiodic activity. This finding indicates that the modulation of aperiodic activity, associated with cognitive control processes, could provide a more sensitive index of cognitive state changes than previously recognised. To further confirm our findings, we also used these analysis methods in an item-recognition task, which showed similar patterns of periodic and aperiodic activity. These observations challenge the conventional understanding of low-frequency oscillations in cognitive processing and raise concerns about the routine practice of EEG baseline correction in time-frequency analysis, as it may obscure significant modulations in continuous working memory tasks. Consequently, the inclusion of aperiodic activity as a fundamental component of EEG analysis is likely to be critical for the accurate representation of the neural basis of cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101894">Calcium transfer from the ER to other organelles for optimal signaling in Toxoplasma gondii</a></h4>

              
                Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cells begins with the opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in either the plasma membrane (PM) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to a sharp increase in the physiologically low (&lt;100 nM) cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. The temporal and spatial regulation of Ca²<sup>+</sup> is crucial for the precise activation of key biological processes. In the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, which infects approximately one-third of the global population, Ca²<sup>+</sup> signaling governs essential aspects of the parasite’s infection cycle. <i>T. gondii</i> relies on Ca²<sup>+</sup> signals to regulate pathogenic traits, with several Ca²<sup>+</sup>-signaling components playing critical roles. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular environment has been demonstrated in <i>T. gondii</i> for both, extracellular parasites, exposed to high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and intracellular parasites, which acquire Ca²<sup>+</sup> from host cells during host Ca²<sup>+</sup> signaling events. Active egress, an essential step of the parasite’s infection cycle, is preceded by a large increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, most likely initiated by release from intracellular stores. However, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also necessary to reach a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> threshold required for timely egress. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of intracellular Ca²<sup>+</sup> store replenishment and identified a central role for the SERCA-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase in maintaining Ca²<sup>+</sup> homeostasis within the ER and in other organelles. We demonstrate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, which occurs by transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, likely through membrane contact sites. Our findings suggest that the <i>T. gondii</i> ER plays a key role in sequestering and redistributing Ca²<sup>+</sup> to intracellular organelles following Ca²<sup>+</sup> influx at the PM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107494">SLC35G3 is a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter for sperm glycoprotein formation and underpins male fertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Despite the recognized importance of glycans in biological phenomena, their complex roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function remain unclear. SLC35G3, a 10-transmembrane protein specifically found in early round spermatids, belongs to the sugar-nucleotide transporter family, indicating its involvement in glycan formation. In this study, we found that <i>Slc35g3</i> knockout male mice were sterile due to impaired sperm functions in uterotubal junction passage, zona pellucida binding, and oocyte fusion. Mouse SLC35G3 has UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity, and its ablation caused abnormal processing of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome membrane proteins. Reported human <i>SLC35G3</i> mutations (F267L and T179HfsTer27) diminished the UDP-GlcNAc transporter activity of SLC35G3, implying infertility risks in males carrying these mutations. Our findings unveil the vital roles of SLC35G3 in the glycan formation of sperm membrane proteins critical for sperm-fertilizing ability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101944">Animacy semantic network supports causal inferences about illness</a></h4>

              
                Inferring the causes of illness is a culturally universal example of causal thinking. We tested the hypothesis that making causal inferences about biological processes (e.g. illness) depends on the animacy semantic network. Participants (<i>n</i>=20) undergoing fMRI read two-sentence vignettes that elicited implicit causal inferences across sentences, either about the emergence of illness or about the mechanical breakdown of inanimate objects, in addition to noncausal control vignettes. All vignettes were about people and were linguistically matched. The same participants performed localizer tasks: language, logical reasoning, and mentalizing. Inferring illness causes, relative to all control conditions, selectively engaged a portion of the precuneus (PC) previously implicated in the semantic representation of animates (e.g. people, animals). Neural responses to causal inferences about illness were adjacent to but distinct from responses to mental state inferences, suggesting a neural mind/body distinction. We failed to find evidence for domain-general responses to causal inference. Causal inference is supported by content-specific semantic networks that encode causal knowledge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104549">Membrane-mimetic thermal proteome profiling (MM-TPP) toward mapping membrane protein–ligand dynamic interactions</a></h4>

              
                Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are central targets for small-molecule therapeutics, yet robust, unbiased, and detergent-free approaches to assess their on- and off-target interactions remain limited. Previously, we introduced the Peptidisc membrane mimetic (MM) for water-soluble stabilization of the membrane proteome and interactome (Carlson et al., eLife, 2019). In this work, we combine the Peptidisc with thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to establish membrane-mimetic thermal proteome profiling (MM-TPP), a method that enables proteome-wide mapping of membrane protein–ligand interactions. Using a membrane protein library derived from mouse liver tissue, we detected the specific effects of ATP and orthovanadate on the thermal stability of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, as well as stability shifts driven by the hydrotropic effect of ATP and its by-products on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In contrast, detergent-based TPP (DB-TPP) with ATP–VO<sub>4</sub> failed to yield specific enrichment of ATP-binding proteins, underscoring the unique capacity of MM-TPP. To further validate the approach, we demonstrated the ability of MM-TPP to detect specific ligand-induced stabilization of cognate targets, exemplified by the selective thermal stabilization of the P2RY12 receptor by 2-methylthio-ADP. Together, these findings position MM-TPP as a robust platform for uncovering both on- and off-target effects of small molecules, providing insights into the druggable membrane proteome and its stability in consequence of changing dynamic ligands.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97043">Anti-diuretic hormone ITP signals via a guanylate cyclase receptor to modulate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Insects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. Here, we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in <i>Drosophila</i>. The <i>Drosophila ITP</i> gene can generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. We comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa-producing neurons are activated and release ITPa during dehydration. Furthermore, recombinant <i>Drosophila</i> ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach, an ex vivo secretion assay and a heterologous mammalian cell-based assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as a bona fide <i>Drosophila</i> ITPa receptor. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis, and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with <i>ITP</i> knockdown and ITPa overexpression in ITPa-producing neurons. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify pathways via which ITP neurons integrate hygrosensory inputs and interact with other homeostatic hormonal pathways. Taken together, our systematic characterization of ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107566">The influence of nucleus accumbens shell D1 and D2 neurons on outcome-specific Pavlovian instrumental transfer</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S) and its projections to the ventral pallidum (VP) are thought to be critical for stimulus-based decisions. The NAc-S is predominantly composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that express either the dopamine D1 (D1-SPNs) or the dopamine D2 receptor (D2-SPNs). Yet, the role of these two neuronal subpopulations and their inputs to the VP in stimulus-based decisions remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics in female and male knock-in rats to selectively silence D1- or D2-SPNs and their projections to the VP at a time when the rats were required to use predictive stimuli to choose between two instrumental actions. Silencing either population of NAc-S SPNs disrupted choice. Silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals in the VP also disrupted choice. However, choice was left intact by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals in the VP. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms and circuitry underlying stimulus-based decisions. We discuss how these insights are consistent with a recent model proposing that these decisions are controlled by an opioid-based memory system residing in the NAc-S.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103697">Rearrangement of 3D genome organization in breast cancer epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis organotropism</a></h4>

              
                Human breast cancer cells exhibit organotropism during metastasis, showing preferential homing to certain organs such as bone, lung, liver, and brain. Spatial genome organization plays a crucial role in oncogenic transformation and progression, but the extent to which chromosome architecture contributes to organ-specific metastatic traits is unclear. This work characterizes chromosome architecture changes associated with organotropic metastatic traits. By comparing a collection of human genomic data from different subtypes of localized and lung metastatic breast cancer cells with both normal and cancerous lung cells, we find important trends of genomic reorganization. The most striking differences in 3D genome compartments segregate cell types according to their epithelial vs. mesenchymal status. This epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) compartment signature occurs at genomic regions distinct from transcription-defined EMT signatures, suggesting a separate layer of regulation. Specifically querying organotropism, we find 3D genome changes consistent with adaptations needed to survive in a new microenvironment, with lung metastatic breast cancer cells exhibiting compartment switch signatures that shift the genome architecture to a lung cell-like conformation and brain metastatic prostate cancer cells showing compartment shifts toward a brain-like state. TCGA patient data reveals gene expression changes concordant with these organ-permissive compartment changes. These results suggest that genome architecture provides an additional level of cell fate specification informing organotropism and enabling survival at the metastatic site.

">Causal role of the individual alpha phase in multisensory perception</a></h4>

              
                The phase of alpha oscillations is proposed to reflect perceptual cycles. Yet, human EEG/MEG studies have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because they used correlative approaches that did not consider causal phase-perception relationships. In a multi-day computational EEG study, we developed the neurobehavioral link function (NBLF) as a new approach to model individual sinusoidal relationships between the alpha phase and multisensory perception and to test for causality. Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis. A follow-up psychophysical experiment confirmed individual phase-dependent effects at 5 and 10 Hz, but not 15 Hz. Our results suggest that the individual alpha phase causally modulates perceptual cycles in multisensory integration and advocate for personalized, phase-targeting strategies in neurotechnologies.

">Early impairment in dentate pattern separation in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy.</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation utilizes sparse neural coding to support memory formation. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the dentate undergoes extensive restructuring, including loss of local inhibition. It is unknown how circuit changes impact dentate network computations in awake behaving animals. Here we perform high-density tetrode recordings from the dentate in male rats treated with systemic kainic acid (KA) to induce TLE. In KA-treated rats, dentate spatial representations were less precise at the single neuron level, however the stability of the spatial code in representing repeated visits to the same location was retained at the population level. Despite spared spatial representation, the network computations for pattern separation were disrupted. The reorganized dentate network in KA-treated rats generated less distinct population activity patterns for different environments, specifically as a result of impaired rate-remapping. Changes in network computations paralleled impairments in a dentate-dependent memory task, potentially providing a link between altered pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These deficits were present in animals with confirmed dentate circuit reorganization that had not yet developed spontaneous seizures - suggesting that the dentate network changes underlying altered rate-remapping and impaired dentate-dependent memory occur early in epileptogenesis.

">FGF13 is not secreted from neurons</a></h4>

              
                FGF13, a noncanonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and member of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor (FHF) subset, lacks a signal sequence and was previously reported to remain intracellular, where it regulates voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at least in part through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of VGSCs. Recent reports suggest that FGF13 is secreted and regulates neuronal VGSCs through interactions with extracellular domains of integral plasma membrane proteins, yet supportive data are limited. Using rigorous positive and negative controls, we show that transfected FGF13 is not secreted from cultured cells in a heterologous expression system nor is endogenous FGF13 secreted from cultured neurons. Further, employing multiple unbiased screens including proximity protein proteomics, our results suggest FGF13 remains within membranes and is unavailable to interact directly with extracellular protein domains.

">Acetylcholine reflects uncertainty during hidden state inference</a></h4>

              
                To act adaptively, animals must infer features of the environment that cannot be observed directly, such as which option is currently rewarding, or which context they are in. These internal estimates, known as hidden states, guide behaviour but are inherently uncertain. Theoretical models propose that efficient inference requires tracking both the most likely state and the uncertainty of that estimate. While neural representations of state identity have been described in cortical and hippocampal circuits, the origin of uncertainty signals remains unclear. Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) reflects this uncertainty during hidden state inference. Using fibre photometry in mice performing a probabilistic two-armed bandit task, we found that ACh release in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus tracked recent omission history and predicted whether animals would switch choice on the next trial. Blocking muscarinic receptors with scopolamine selectively impaired loss-driven switching without affecting stable performance. A hidden-state inference model in which ACh modulated how uncertainty from past experience shaped future beliefs reproduced both the physiological and behavioural effects, whereas alternative models did not. These results identify ACh as a neuromodulatory signal reflecting uncertainty during hidden-state inference, linking theoretical models of belief updating to their biological implementation in the mammalian brain.

">An Autophagy-Inducing Compound Reduces Tau Pathology, Microglia Reactivity, and Rescues Working Memory in 3xTg AD Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have validated the use of amyloid beta (A{beta})-clearing antibodies, which reduce A{beta} pathology but leave other disease hallmarks largely unaddressed. Since AD involves multiple pathological processes, additional strategies are needed to target complementary mechanisms. One such target is autophagy, a lysosomal mediated degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis that removes toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. This process is implicated in AD, as impaired lysosomal function promotes A{beta} and tau accumulation. Our laboratory recently identified a novel natural mitophagy-inducing compound (MIC) that may serve as a therapeutic intervention for AD. Methods We evaluated the effects of MIC in aged 3xTgAD mice, a transgenic model displaying both A{beta} and tau pathology. Mice received either standard diet or diet containing MIC beginning at age 4 months until 20 months on alternating weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic (NonTg) controls were included under standard and MIC-supplemented diets to assess compound effects during normal aging. Neuropathological changes were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, phosphorylated tau (pTau), and microglial reactivity. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess spatial learning and memory and the Y-maze to measure working memory. Results At 20 months of age, our neuropathological assessment showed that 3xTgAD mice fed an MIC-supplemented diet had a significant reduction in pTau accumulation and microglial reactivity, although A{beta} burden remained unchanged. At 15 months, MIC diet also improved spatial learning and memory in aged NonTg controls but not in 3xTgAD mice. However, in younger 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice, MIC restored working memory performance to NonTg levels, indicating an age-dependent therapeutic response. Conclusion MIC emerges as a potential modulator of tau pathology and neuroinflammation. As a naturally derived compound, MIC offers potential for combination therapy with FDA-approved A{beta}-clearing antibodies, enabling a multimodal approach to AD treatment that addresses amyloid, tau, and microglia-related pathology.

">The Rise and Fall of SARM1 Base-Exchange Inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                The sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) enzyme is a key driver of axonal degeneration in response to injury, making it an attractive target for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and other nervous system diseases. In this study, we identified and optimised a new class of base-exchange inhibitors (BEXi) targeting SARM1 and explored their molecular interactions and conformational effects using cryo-EM, HDX-MS and SAXS. Although BEXi produced robust inhibition across all biochemical and cellular assay formats, application at sub-inhibitory concentrations consistently led to paradoxical SARM1 activation, and in neuronal assays, accelerated neurite degeneration. Further analysis showed that BEXi only delayed, rather than prevented, neurite degeneration when applied to primary neuronal cells, even at exceedingly high inhibitor concentrations. These results prompted us to discontinue BEXi development in favour of alternative strategies, underscoring the complexity of SARM1 as a therapeutic target and the need for comprehensive, mechanistically informed screening cascades.

">Environmental factors contribute to cancer therapy toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects numerous cancer patients, however there is substantial variability in its severity. Here, we investigated how environmental factors such as housing facility and time of treatment, known as chronotherapy, impact chemotoxicity in a pediatric murine model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced CRCI. We find that MTX consistently impacts body mass in a time-of-day specific manner across different housing facilities. Intriguingly, investigation of the gut microbiome acutely after MTX chronotherapy revealed substantial differences in microbial composition between animals housed in different facilities as well as decreased microbial diversity at different times of day. Furthermore, these differences in the gut microbiome after MTX chronotherapy coincide with differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine profiles between facilities and times of day. Chronically, housing facility continued to impact serum cytokine levels after MTX treatment, whereas the effect of time wanes. Nonetheless, we found that time drastically alters chronic white matter microglial gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) after MTX treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate that both housing facility and time dictate response to MTX chronotherapy in the periphery and CNS. Collectively, this work elucidates putative factors that can regulate MTX-induced chemotoxicity.

">Scalable spike sorting across thousands of neurons by modeling neural dynamics with NeuroSort</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuit research requires resolving the functional coding mechanisms at the single-neuron scale. However, neural signals captured from extracellular recordings are inherently complex, shaped both by electrode properties and the spatially distributed neural population activity across recording sites. These factors introduce strong signal mixing and waveform variation, making it diffcult for existing spike sorting methods to reliably isolate individual neurons from large-scale recodings. To address this, we develop NeuroSort, which fuses spatiotemporal information through a contrastive learning strategy to adaptively model neural dynamics. NeuroSort is a GPU-enabled, highly efficient spike sorting framework, enabling the isolating of up to thousands of neurons. We validated NeuroSort on in vivo extracellular recordings, including Utah array data from rhesus macaques performing motor tasks and Neuropixels 1.0 probe data from a rat during rest. Moreover, in a recording collected by the 1,024-channel Neuroscroll probe, NeuroSort sorted the largest number of well-isolated neurons from different brain areas while achieving a 2-8 times speedup over other methods.Taken together, NeuroSort generalizes across recording conditions, providing an interpretable and scalable paradigm for whole-brain dynamic analysis.

">Multiple patterns of selectivity in superior colliculus control visual search</a></h4>

              
                Visual search is a ubiquitous behavior for many animal species, but efficient search performance requires a relatively complex integration of target guidance and behavioral history signals. In this study, we investigate how the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain area implicated in the control of overt spatial attention, integrates these two control signals in a multi-target search task. Monkeys made sequences of saccades to stimuli presented in a grid while searching for a "true" (reward eliciting) target amid color-coded targets and distractors. The efficient performance of this task requires integrating a target guidance signal with a history of previously fixated locations in order to guide search to new potential targets that might offer reward. Theories of systems neuroscience suggest that this multi-factor search behavior might be controlled using either mixed selectivity, dynamic selectivity, or pure selectivity. We find evidence for SC neurons exhibiting each of these patterns and conclude that this brain structure participates in circuits representing target similarity and previously fixated locations, in addition to a circuit responsible for integrating these signals using the mechanisms of dynamic and mixed selectivity. We also introduce a novel time-series partial information decomposition analysis that provides a rich and direct view of how a neuron allocates its representational capacity. These findings support an emerging view of the superior colliculus as much more than a bottom-up priority map, but instead an important site for the flexible cognitive control of visually-guided behavior.

">Thyrotropin-releasing hormone protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is best known as a neuropeptide that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Independent from its activity in the HPT axis, TRH also exerts strong neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Although multiple factors have been linked to its neuroprotective action, the cellular mechanism of TRH neuroprotection is still not clear. Here we show that TRH protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated TRH transduction and TRH peptide given exogenously over 24 hours period of time inhibit glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This effect is not mediated by the decreased intracellular calcium response as TRH treatment (24 hours) has no effect on glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium nor the calpain activity. While TRH treatment (10 minutes) significantly inhibits glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium, no protective effect is observed when TRH is applied 30 minutes before or after glutamate stimulation. Instead, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibits the protective effect of TRH. LY294002 also blocks TRH induced AKT activation. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits the protective effect of TRH. Taken together, these results suggest PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and new protein synthesis are involved in the protective effect of TRH against glutamate toxicity, thereby providing mechanistic support for its action in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Olfactory biopsy analysis of Alzheimer's pathobiology across disease stages</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide. Defining early pathobiological events remains challenging, in part due to inaccessibility of neural tissue. Because olfactory neurons are accessible, and olfactory loss is prevalent in AD, we evaluated olfactory brush biopsies from controls, individuals with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-confirmed AD, and cognitively typical individuals whose positive biomarkers signal a pre-clinical AD stage. We define via single cell RNA-sequencing (n=22 subjects) conserved neuroinflammatory T cell, myeloid, and olfactory neuron changes detectable even in pre-clinical AD subjects. Activated memory T cell states were a hallmark of pre-clinical AD, paralleling CSF T cell phenotypes seen in advanced disease, accompanied by both microglia-like inflammatory programs and olfactory neuron inflammatory injury. Together, our findings establish a novel platform permitting analysis of neural tissue in AD at its earliest stages.

">Autonomic reflex plasticity associates with time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in a murine model with hyperactive stress circuits</a></h4>

              
                Sudden unexpected death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with Epilepsy. Although SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory arrest, its underlaying mechanisms are poorly understood. Considering the significant association between stress-related disorders and Epilepsy, we hypothesized that stress exaggerates autonomic reflexes critical in cardiorespiratory function and that these exaggerated reflexes increase susceptibility to SUDEP. Experiments were performed using a novel mouse model of SUDEP where chronic hyperactivity of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Kcc2/Crh) predisposes mice to SUDEP in the weeks following seizure induction based on the ventral intrahippocampal kainate (vIHKA) model of chronic Epilepsy. In our study, the vIHKA model was employed in both wild-type (WT) and Kcc2/Crh mice while they were monitored with EEG and ECG using in vivo telemetry and underwent terminal autonomic reflex testing at time points when mortality peaked and plateaued. A resting tachycardia developed by one week following vIHKA injection but subsided by day 30 in both WT and Kcc2/Crh mice. During spontaneous seizures, Kcc2/Crh mice had more pronounced reflex-like ictal bradycardias compared to WT controls that notably occurred just prior to seizure termination. vIHKA injection promoted time-dependent exaggeration of autonomic reflexes, with Kcc2/Crh mice exhibiting robust autonomic disturbances compared to WT controls, including a pronounced serotonin-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased autonomic disturbance burden parallels time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in mice with hyperactive stress circuits.

">Self-compassion is linked to positive affect and buffers declines in self-esteem in low performers</a></h4>

              
                Successes and failures shape affective experience and self-esteem. Self-compassion has been proposed as a protective factor, allowing individuals to acknowledge both strengths and shortcomings without excessive self-criticism. However, the mechanisms through which self-compassion influences changes in affect and self-esteem remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally tested whether self-compassion modulates the links between performance feedback, affective experience, and self-esteem. Participants completed an effortful performance task and received trial-by-trial feedback while repeatedly rating their positive affect. Results show that self-compassion buffered against declines in self-esteem among poorly performing individuals, predicted higher overall positive affect throughout the task, and was associated with increased post-task self-esteem. Moreover, performance feedback predicted positive affect, which in turn predicted post-task self-esteem, although these pathways were not moderated by self-compassion. Together, these findings add to the growing evidence for how self-compassion impacts positive affect and self-esteem and may inform treatment strategies for clinical populations characterized by low self-esteem or heightened self-criticism.
