              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00278">A data-driven biophysical network model reproduces C. elegans premotor neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: C. elegans locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of C. elegans neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biophysical dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. The model correctly predicts behavior such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received, and we demonstrate that it can be used to study how the activity level of certain individual neurons impacts behavior.

                arXiv:2501.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing symbiosis between artificial and biological intelligence sciences: neural principles inspire new intelligent machines, which are in turn used to advance our theoretical understanding of the brain. To promote further collaboration between biological and artificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2025 edition of the Algonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies (https://algonautsproject.com/). In collaboration with the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod), this edition aims to bring forth a new generation of brain encoding models that are multimodal and that generalize well beyond their training distribution, by training them on the largest dataset of fMRI responses to movie watching available to date. Open to all, the 2025 challenge provides transparent, directly comparable results through a public leaderboard that is updated automatically after each submission to facilitate rapid model assessment and guide development. The challenge will end with a session at the 2025 Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) conference that will feature winning models. We welcome researchers interested in collaborating with the Algonauts Project by contributing ideas and datasets for future challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00720">Realistic overground gait transitions are not sharp but involve gradually changing walk-run mixtures as per energy optimality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans use two qualitatively different gaits for locomotion, namely, walking and running -- usually using walking at lower speeds and running at higher speeds. Researchers have examined when humans switch between walking and running on treadmills and have noted hystereses in these gait transition speeds. Here, we consider an ecologically realistic overground locomotion task, one requiring traveling a given long distance (800 meters or 2400 meters) in a prescribed time duration. Unlike on a treadmill, this task allows the human to change speed or gait during the trial to reach the destination on time: this task is akin to traveling to an appointment at a particular time from your office to another office, arriving neither early or late. We find that gait transition is not sharp, but instead involves a 'gait transition regime' in which humans use a mixture of walking and running, using mostly walking atlower speeds and mostly running higher speeds -- supporting earlier results over short distances (120 m). The presence of this gradually changing walk-run mixture is predicted by energy optimality. We hypothesize that this energy optimal behavior in this realistic overground conditions accounts for the hysteretic behavior in treadmill experiments, apparently switching earlier than predicted by energy optimality.

                arXiv:2501.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By retracing my scientific journey that began 20 years ago, I highlight in this thesis the need to consider the organization of the brain, which is certainly globally hierarchical, but also highly distributed and mixed in the neuronal response of its different areas (by focusing on the sensorimotor cortex-basal ganglia network). I also emphasize the importance of adopting behavioral paradigms that reflect as much as possible the characteristics of the scenarios encountered in the real life of animals. And finally, I mention the importance of "disintegrating" the way data analysis is traditionally carried out, and of taking into account the dynamic nature of behavior, for example by favoring the study of behavioral variables and so-called "latent" neuronal activities. I conclude this thesis by presenting the vision of my ideal laboratory in a perspective of 5 to 10 years from today. This laboratory would have two experimental devices, a first, classic, for carrying out tests in a constrained and therefore unnatural environment, the data of which would be compared to those from a second device called "naturalistic" in which the animals could potentially express their entire behavioral repertoire. The tasks tested would be characterized by strong ecological principles, such as in those simulating the properties of foraging, and the data would make it possible to test hypotheses based on the progressive addition of ecological components in these tasks, all this in order to maintain control over the interpretability of these data which are complex by nature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00043">Recursive introversion, iterative extroversion and transitive ambiversion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through mathematical modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion processes. Introversion is interpreted as a recursive process characterized by deep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is presented as an iterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and ambiversion is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these two opposing processes. The developed model is based on principles of complex systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and synergetics, enabling the perception of personality as an adaptive and multilayered system.
  The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of internal and external factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such as sensitivity coefficients, weighting factors of stimuli, and synergy parameters, are also explored.
  The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in psychotherapy, education, personnel management, and other areas where it is necessary to consider personality traits and their dynamics. The model provides new opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and correcting personality changes, enhancing methods of working with individuals.
  The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis, providing a theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics. They also create a foundation for further interdisciplinary research in psychology, the cognitive sciences, and social systems.
  Specifically, the formalization considered in the context of program algorithms allows for the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological archetypes (introvert robots, extrovert robots, and ambivert robots).

                arXiv:2501.01022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.

                arXiv:2412.21111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated information theory (IIT) argues that the substrate of consciousness is a maximally irreducible complex of units. Together, subsets of the complex specify a cause-effect structure, composed of distinctions and their relations, which accounts in full for the quality of experience. The feeling of a specific experience is also its meaning for the subject, which is thus defined intrinsically, regardless of whether the experience occurs in a dream or is triggered by processes in the environment. Here we extend IIT's framework to characterize the relationship between intrinsic meaning, extrinsic stimuli, and causal processes in the environment, illustrated using a simple model of a sensory hierarchy. We argue that perception should be considered as a structured interpretation, where a stimulus from the environment acts merely as a trigger for the complex's state and the structure is provided by the complex's intrinsic connectivity. We also propose that perceptual differentiation - the richness and diversity of structures triggered by representative sequences of stimuli - quantifies the meaningfulness of different environments to a complex. In adaptive systems, this reflects the "matching" between intrinsic meanings and causal processes in an environment.

                arXiv:2403.20177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of artificial consciousness requires conceptual clarity to navigate its theoretical and empirical challenges. This paper introduces a composite, multilevel, and multidimensional model of consciousness as a heuristic framework to guide research in this field. Consciousness is treated as a complex phenomenon, with distinct constituents and dimensions that can be operationalized for study and for evaluating their replication. We argue that this model provides a balanced approach to artificial consciousness research by avoiding binary thinking (e.g., conscious vs. non-conscious) and offering a structured basis for testable hypotheses. To illustrate its utility, we focus on "awareness" as a case study, demonstrating how specific dimensions of consciousness can be pragmatically analyzed and targeted for potential artificial instantiation. By breaking down the conceptual intricacies of consciousness and aligning them with practical research goals, this paper lays the groundwork for a robust strategy to advance the scientific and technical understanding of artificial consciousness.

Abstract: The Numerical Association Rule Mining paradigm that includes concurrent dealing with numerical and categorical attributes is beneficial for discovering associations from datasets consisting of both features. The process is not considered as easy since it incorporates several processing steps running sequentially that form an entire pipeline, e.g., preprocessing, algorithm selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and the definition of metrics evaluating the quality of the association rule. In this paper, we proposed a novel Automated Machine Learning method, NiaAutoARM, for constructing the full association rule mining pipelines based on stochastic population-based meta-heuristics automatically. Along with the theoretical representation of the proposed method, we also present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method.

                arXiv:2501.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.

Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms of which includes repetitive behaviour and lack of social and communication skills. Even though these symptoms can be seen very clearly in social but a large number of individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. In this paper, we worked on a methodology for the detection of ASD from a 3-dimensional walking video dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms and nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction from the dataset. The proposed methodology involves the classification of ASD using a supervised ML classification algorithm and extracting important and relevant features from the dataset using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. We also included the ranking coefficients to find the initial leading particle. This selection of particle significantly reduces the computation time and hence, improves the total efficiency and accuracy for ASD detection. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we deployed various combinationsalgorithms of classification algorithm and nature-inspired algorithms resulting in an outstanding classification accuracy of $100\%$ using the random forest classification algorithm and gravitational search algorithm for feature selection. The application of the proposed methodology with different datasets would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methodology. Due to high accuracy and less total computation time, the proposed methodology will offer a significant contribution to the medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future research and advancements in ASD diagnosis.

                arXiv:2208.04957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating agents that can achieve zero-shot coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks.

                This policy brief examines the key factors influencing entrepreneurial success in Lebanon, focusing on gender dynamics, socio-cultural barriers, and systemic challenges. Entrepreneurship plays a critical role in Lebanon’s economic growth, innovation, and job creation, yet local entrepreneurs face significant obstacles. These challenges, including high operational costs, political instability, and gender-based discrimination, are compounded by limited access to resources such as funding, networks, and mentorship, particularly for women. The brief draws on data from the MENA Entrepreneurship and Labour Market Survey (MELMS) to provide insights into Lebanon’s entrepreneurial landscape. Based on the findings, this brief highlights the urgent need for targeted policy interventions aimed at enhancing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and addressing gender inequities. The recommendations include increasing awareness of support services, improving access to financial resources, fostering innovation through tech hubs and R&D incentives, and promoting a more inclusive entrepreneurial culture. To address gender-specific barriers, the brief proposes expanding training and mentorship programs tailored for women, along with targeted outreach efforts to bridge the gap in access to information. Strengthening Lebanon’s entrepreneurial ecosystem through public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and leveraging the Lebanese diaspora is also critical for driving economic resilience. The proposed recommendations call for the establishment of a National Entrepreneurship Strategy that integrates public institutions, NGOs, and private sector initiatives to foster sustainable growth. By creating a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs, Lebanon can unlock its entrepreneurial potential, driving long-term innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness. This brief aims to inform policymakers, donors, and stakeholders of strategic interventions that can contribute to Lebanon’s economic revitalisation.

                Background This study examines the Arabic semi-prepositional contronym /warā’a/ in the Holy Quran, which conveys the dual meanings of ‘behind’ and ‘in front of.’ By employing cognitive linguistic frameworks—Prototype Theory, Image Schema Theory, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and Frame Semantics—the research investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying the term’s semantic versatility. Methods An in-depth cognitive linguistic analysis was conducted, supported by collocational analysis to explore how /warā’a/ is interpreted in diverse contexts. The study analyzed both prototypical spatial meanings and their metaphorical extensions, focusing on semantic priming and contextual interpretation. Results The findings reveal that the prototypical spatial meaning of /warā’a/ (‘behind’) dynamically extends to metaphorical and temporal contexts, encompassing ideas of concealment, control, deliberate ignorance, future anticipation, and other nuanced interpretations. The research highlights the role of semantic priming in shaping contextual meanings and offers actionable insights for translation accuracy in religious texts. Conclusions This study fills gaps in existing research by providing a detailed exploration of /warā’a/’s semantic complexity. It bridges theoretical insights and practical applications, offering innovative strategies for linguistics and translation studies. Future research directions include cross-linguistic studies of contronyms, psycholinguistic experiments on contradictory meanings, and culturally-informed cognitive-semantic translation strategies. This work contributes significantly to Arabic linguistics and cognitive translation studies.

                Background Anti-viral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in patients who have persistently elevated serum HBV DNA level (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and without significant liver fibrosis, defining the indeterminate phase. The objective of the study is to identify the factors associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in chronic HBV infected patients in the indeterminate phase. Methods This is cross-sectional study, conducted in Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached university hospital, between January 2008 and January 2022. We have included the Ag HBs (+) patients initially not treated, presenting at the time of the initial evaluation: a viral load> 2,000 IU/L for at least six months, normal ALAT (<40UI) and a fibrosis score F0 and/or F1 (in liverbiopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logisticreg ression analysis were performed to identify the factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results In total, 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (sex ratio M/F=0.64). Progression of fibrosis was observed in 16 patients (16.5%) with a mean delay of 70.9±41.1 months. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with progression of fibrosis were the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), the high initial viral load (p=0.004), the appearance of cytolysis (p=0.001) and the increase in viral load (p=0.002), during follow-up. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). An intial viral load at 8090 UI/l was associated with the progression of fibrosis with a sensibility of 70.3% and specificity of 63%. Conclusion Factors associated with progression of fibrosis in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection were the presence of comorbidities, and changes of ALAT during follow-up. This leads us to consider extending the therapeutic indications to this group of patients.

                Background Quality of neonatal transport services may impact outcomes. We assessed the effect of skill-based education of ambulance personnel (AP) on outcomes of transported neonates. Methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study (pre and post) over 18 months. We assessed the perceptions and practices of AP on neonatal transport along with ambulance equipment availability/usage. We compared neonatal clinical vital parameters at arrival and clinical outcomes from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) pre versus post intervention. We analysed data using SPSS version 25. Results Of 77 AP receiving education, there was significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the perceptions/practices towards temperature regulation (44.55 ± 23.94 vs. 25.94 ± 21.36), glucose homeostasis (46.27 ± 18.83 vs. 18.60 ± 17.50), maintaining asepsis (67.05 ± 17.53 vs. 39.35 ± 16.85), supporting airway (47.73 ± 25.39), circulation (85.26 ± 23.27 vs. 48.45 ± 25.10), along with ambulance equipment availability/usage postintervention. Of 53 neonates studied post intervention, there was a significant reduction in hypothermia (17% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (16.9% vs. 38.7%, p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (71.7% vs. 46.8%, p=0.042), improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (69.8% vs. 29%, p <0.001), a reduction in growth from umbilical swabs (15.1% vs. 42%, p=0.002) and duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001). Conclusions After educational intervention there was significant improvement in the perceptions and practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel towards transporting neonates and a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay with improvement in maintenance of circulation and asepsis in neonates.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (HR:12; 95% CI: (5.81-18.18); p:0.041) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age > 53 years (p: 0.018), septic shock complicating hospital acquired infection (p: 0.003) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Objective To compare iodine density (ID) and contrast-enhanced attenuation value (CEAV) from dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) scans of lymphomatous, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), and normal cervical lymph nodes. Methods Data including ID and CEAV were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent DLSCT of the neck between January 2020 and August 2023. Results from each group (lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal) were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results 129 cervical lymph nodes were collected from patients who met the inclusion criteria (50, 41, and 38 nodes from the lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal group, respectively). The mean ID of lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal nodes was 1.01±0.27, 1.36±0.28, and 1.45±0.29 mg/mL, respectively. Comparing lymphomatous nodes with metastatic SCCA nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.002) and CEAV (p<0.001). Similarly, when comparing lymphomatous nodes with normal nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.001) and CEAV (p<0.001). The optimal ID cut-off value for distinguishing between lymphomatous and metastatic SCCA nodes was 1.175 mg/ml (specificity of 84.2%, sensitivity 77.8%, AUC 0.788, P = 0.003). The optimal CEAV cut-off value was 77.5 HU (specificity 88.9%, sensitivity 78.9%, AUC 0.851, P<0.001). Conclusions The ID and CEAV measurements from DLSCT were significantly different between lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal lymph nodes. These findings indicate that DLSCT can be used to distinguish between these conditions in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Synthetic data’s utility in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Building on Nearing et al.’s study (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental 16S rRNA datasets in a case-control design, we are generating synthetic datasets that mimic the experimental data to verify their findings. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines, demonstrating how established reporting frameworks can support robust, transparent, and unbiased study planning. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on a non-redundant subset of 46 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, try to validate previous findings with the most recent versions of the DA methods and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCA’s efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012721">Sparse high-dimensional decomposition of non-primary auditory cortical receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shoutik Mukherjee, Behtash Babadi, Shihab Shamma</p>

Characterizing neuronal responses to natural stimuli remains a central goal in sensory neuroscience. In auditory cortical neurons, the stimulus selectivity of elicited spiking activity is summarized by a spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) that relates neuronal responses to the stimulus spectrogram. Though effective in characterizing primary auditory cortical responses, STRFs of non-primary auditory neurons can be quite intricate, reflecting their mixed selectivity. The complexity of non-primary STRFs hence impedes understanding how acoustic stimulus representations are transformed along the auditory pathway. Here, we focus on the relationship between ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) and a secondary region, dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG). We propose estimating receptive fields in PEG with respect to a well-established high-dimensional computational model of primary-cortical stimulus representations. These “cortical receptive fields” (CortRF) are estimated greedily to identify the salient primary-cortical features modulating spiking responses and in turn related to corresponding spectrotemporal features. Hence, they provide biologically plausible hierarchical decompositions of STRFs in PEG. Such CortRF analysis was applied to PEG neuronal responses to speech and temporally orthogonal ripple combination (TORC) stimuli and, for comparison, to A1 neuronal responses. CortRFs of PEG neurons captured their selectivity to more complex spectrotemporal features than A1 neurons; moreover, CortRF models were more predictive of PEG (but not A1) responses to speech. Our results thus suggest that secondary-cortical stimulus representations can be computed as sparse combinations of primary-cortical features that facilitate encoding natural stimuli. Thus, by adding the primary-cortical representation, we can account for PEG single-unit responses to natural sounds better than bypassing it and considering as input the auditory spectrogram. These results confirm with explicit details the presumed hierarchical organization of the auditory cortex.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) after a long latent period in a fraction of infected individuals. These HTLV-1-infected cells typically have phenotypes similar to that of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, but the cell status is not well understood. To extract the inherent information of HTLV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, we integratively analyzed the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data of the infected cells. Compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from healthy donors, we found anomalous chromatin accessibility in HTLV-1infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells derived from ATL cases in terms of location and sample-to-sample fluctuations in open chromatin regions. Further, by focusing on systematically selected genes near the open chromatin regions, we quantified the difference between the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in ATL cases and healthy CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in terms of the correlation between the chromatin structures and the gene expressions. Based on a further analysis of chromatin accessibility, we detected <i>TLL1</i> (Tolloid Like 1) as one of the key genes that exhibit unique gene expressions in ATL cases. A luciferase assay indicated that TLL1 has an isoform-dependent regulatory effect on TGF-<i>β</i>. Overall, this study provides results about the status of HTLV-1-infected cells, which are qualitatively consistent across the different scales of chromatin accessibility, transcription, and immunophenotype.

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Aim This quantitative study aimed to develop and evaluate instruments to measure responsible tourism behavior with high academic standards. Methods Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were employed to test the model’s fit with the empirical data. The sample consists of 550 Generation Y tourists selected through multistage quota random sampling. The instruments were created by the researchers to consist of 45 items, each rated on a 6-point scale. Results The analysis results supported all three hypotheses, with the instruments showing an average reliability of .812. The EFA results indicated that 12 items met the criteria, derived from three main components: environmental (four items), social and cultural (four items), and economic (four items). These components explain 62.118% of the variance in responsible tourism behavior. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis results show that the model fits the empirical data well, with indices meeting the standard criteria: χ2 = 52.790, df = 45, p-value = .198, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .979, TLI = .969, SRMA = .054. Conclusioin In conclusion, the researchers suggest using responsible tourism behavior measurement instruments experimentally to create social indices or to further study causal factors and effects.

                Background The search for efficient treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has highlighted the potential of plant-based therapeutic compounds and eco-friendly processes for producing selenium nanoparticles. This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of Moringa oleifera-mediated biogenic selenium nanoparticles (MO-SeNPs) in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with diabetes via a high-fat diet for 2 weeks followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 45 mg/kg body weight (BW). The rats were divided into five groups: normal, diabetic control, metformin at 100 mg/kg/BW, and two groups treated with oral administration of MO-SeNPs at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. Food and water intake as well as fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured weekly. After the treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and blood and liver samples were harvested for further analysis. Results MO-SeNPs treatment significantly reduced blood glucose levels (p < 0.05) and restored insulin resistance, with lower dose demonstrating better glycaemic control than larger dose. MO-SeNPs also increased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activity, including GSH-Px, CAT, and T-SOD, which neutralise oxidative stress. MO-SeNPs also improves cardiovascular health by raising HDL and lowering LDL. MO-SeNPs showed hepatoprotective benefits by lowering inflammatory markers such TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and AGEs, and reduced lipid peroxidation. Diabetes raises inflammatory indicators, causing liver damage and other problems. The reduction in these indicators shows MO-SeNPs reduce liver inflammation and protect the liver. The normalisation of liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP) showed improved liver function. Conclusions The findings suggest that the green synthesis of SeNPs using Moringa oleifera offers a viable alternative for diabetes treatment, highlighting its potential to enhance glycemic control and improve overall metabolic health.

                One of the most common benign lesions is dentigerous cyst, which is commonly associated with unerupted tooth crowns. Dentigerous cysts in infants may manifest as swelling or a firm mass in the oral cavity. Such cysts arise from dental follicles, and their development can lead to dental complications such as tooth displacement, root resorption of the adjacent teeth, or infection if not treated carefully. Enucleation is the method of choice for the treatment of such lesions. In the current case report, a rare age presented with 1 a old patient was referred to oral and maxillofacial clinics. In the case of right facial swelling and pain for five days ago, intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed. Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a well-defined expansile lytic lesion, and parents consented and agreed to proceed with the surgery option. Enucleation was performed surgically, and the patient was followed up for up to 8 months. Significant improvement was noted, with no further complications or recorded complaints.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as α-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of α-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249°C-254°C) had the highest α-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC value was determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to α-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that α-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs and classified based on the severity from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Based on the severity, most pDDIs belong to the ‘moderate’ category (40.07%). Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in identifying and preventing DDIs early, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

<p>A general summary of the experimental design and results of the present experiments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that hippocampal (HPC) disruption following learning produces retrograde amnesia on a range of tasks. Many of these tasks do not require HPC function in the anterograde direction suggesting that, in the intact brain, the HPC is actively involved during all forms of learning. However, prior work has also demonstrated double dissociations of HPC and amygdala function, which is inconsistent with this view. Here, we aim to understand this discrepancy by assessing the effects of neurotoxic lesions of the HPC on anterograde and retrograde amnesia for conditioned place preference (CPP). This task is dependent on a network centered on the basolateral amygdala and not the HPC. The results show that extensive HPC damage had no impact on the acquisition or expression of CPP. One explanation for this result is that the task requires multiple, distributed training sessions for conditioning to emerge, and it has been proposed that this parameter may eliminate the need for HPC to support memory. To test this, we completed experiments to probe place learning in the Morris water task, which is thought to always require HPC function, but implemented an over-training procedure before HPC damage. We found that rats were severely impaired suggesting that this task parameter does not always allow non-HPC networks to support learning. Finally, an experiment was designed to test whether memories acquired by distinct memory networks on the same days, within hours of one another, would be linked in HPC. The results showed that they remained independent of one another.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97017">The nanoscale organization of the Nipah virus fusion protein informs new membrane fusion mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Paramyxovirus membrane fusion requires an attachment protein for receptor binding and a fusion protein for membrane fusion triggering. Nipah virus (NiV) attachment protein (G) binds to ephrinB2 or -B3 receptors, and fusion protein (F) mediates membrane fusion. NiV-F is a class I fusion protein and is activated by endosomal cleavage. The crystal structure of a soluble GCN4-decorated NiV-F shows a hexamer-of-trimer assembly. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the NiV-F distribution and organization on cell and virus-like particle membranes at a nanometer precision. We found that NiV-F on biological membranes forms distinctive clusters that are independent of endosomal cleavage or expression levels. The sequestration of NiV-F into dense clusters favors membrane fusion triggering. The nano-distribution and organization of NiV-F are susceptible to mutations at the hexamer-of-trimer interface, and the putative oligomerization motif on the transmembrane domain. We also show that NiV-F nanoclusters are maintained by NiV-F–AP-2 interactions and the clathrin coat assembly. We propose that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities for interacting with the NiV-G/receptor complex. These observations provide insights into the in situ organization and activation mechanisms of the NiV fusion machinery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96743">The co-receptor Tetraspanin12 directly captures Norrin to promote ligand-specific β-catenin signaling</a></h4>

              
                Wnt/β-catenin signaling directs animal development and tissue renewal in a tightly controlled, cell- and tissue-specific manner. In the mammalian central nervous system, the atypical ligand Norrin controls angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and blood-retina barrier through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Like Wnt, Norrin activates signaling by binding and heterodimerizing the receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), leading to membrane recruitment of the intracellular transducer Dishevelled (Dvl) and ultimately stabilizing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Unlike Wnt, the cystine knot ligand Norrin only signals through Fzd4 and additionally requires the co-receptor Tetraspanin12 (Tspan12); however, the mechanism underlying Tspan12-mediated signal enhancement is unclear. It has been proposed that Tspan12 integrates into the Norrin-Fzd4 complex to enhance Norrin-Fzd4 affinity or otherwise allosterically modulate Fzd4 signaling. Here, we measure direct, high-affinity binding between purified Norrin and Tspan12 in a lipid environment and use AlphaFold models to interrogate this interaction interface. We find that Tspan12 and Fzd4 can simultaneously bind Norrin and that a pre-formed Tspan12/Fzd4 heterodimer, as well as cells co-expressing Tspan12 and Fzd4, more efficiently capture low concentrations of Norrin than Fzd4 alone. We also show that Tspan12 competes with both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LRP6 for Norrin binding and that Tspan12 does not impact Fzd4-Dvl affinity in the presence or absence of Norrin. Our findings suggest that Tspan12 does not allosterically enhance Fzd4 binding to Norrin or Dvl, but instead functions to directly capture Norrin upstream of signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99798">Opposing roles for Bmp signalling during the development of electrosensory lateral line organs</a></h4>

              
                The lateral line system enables fishes and aquatic-stage amphibians to detect local water movement via mechanosensory hair cells in neuromasts, and many species to detect weak electric fields via electroreceptors (modified hair cells) in ampullary organs. Both neuromasts and ampullary organs develop from lateral line placodes, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning ampullary organ formation are understudied relative to neuromasts. This is because the ancestral lineages of zebrafish (teleosts) and <i>Xenopus</i> (frogs) independently lost electroreception. We identified <i>Bmp5</i> as a promising candidate via differential RNA-seq in an electroreceptive ray-finned fish, the Mississippi paddlefish (<i>Polyodon spathula</i>; Modrell et al., 2017, <i>eLife</i> 6: e24197). In an experimentally tractable relative, the sterlet sturgeon (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>), we found that <i>Bmp5</i> and four other Bmp pathway genes are expressed in the developing lateral line, and that Bmp signalling is active. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis targeting <i>Bmp5</i> in G0-injected sterlet embryos resulted in fewer ampullary organs. Conversely, when Bmp signalling was inhibited by DMH1 treatment shortly before the formation of ampullary organ primordia, supernumerary ampullary organs developed. These data suggest that Bmp5 promotes ampullary organ development, whereas Bmp signalling via another ligand(s) prevents their overproduction. Taken together, this demonstrates opposing roles for Bmp signalling during ampullary organ formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100427">Magnesium modulates phospholipid metabolism to promote bacterial phenotypic resistance to antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Non-inheritable antibiotic or phenotypic resistance ensures bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment. However, exogenous factors promoting phenotypic resistance are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> are recalcitrant to killing by a broad spectrum of antibiotics under high magnesium. Functional metabolomics demonstrated that magnesium modulates fatty acid biosynthesis by increasing saturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing unsaturated fatty acid production. Exogenous supplementation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids increased and decreased bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, respectively, confirming the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Functional lipidomics revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnesium, where phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is reduced and phosphatidylglycerol production is increased. This process alters membrane composition, increasing membrane polarization, and decreasing permeability and fluidity, thereby reducing antibiotic uptake by <i>V. alginolyticus</i>. These findings suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism by which bacteria escape antibiotic killing through the use of an environmental factor.

">Independent regulation of memory and emotion by selective retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Selective retrieval of a target memory often triggers inhibitory control to reduce competition from related traces, a process that induces forgetting of the competing content. It is unknown, however, whether inhibition during selective retrieval specifically targets a competitor's episodic representation or instead extends to its affective components. Here we report evidence in humans that selective retrieval of a neutral memory not only diminishes access to the mnemonic content of unpleasant competing memories, but also alters their emotional character. Memory and emotion suppression effects were accompanied by reduced neural activation and weakened representational patterns unique to competing memories in the VTC and amygdala respectively, in an independent fashion. Selective retrieval engaged the left VLPFC, which decreased in activity over repeated retrievals of the same memory, as competition from the unpleasant scene was resolved. This left VLPFC region colocalizes with key prefrontal regions engaged during cognitive reappraisal, suggesting that selective retrieval's impact on affective responses may contribute to reappraisal's benefits. These findings indicate that inhibitory control during selective retrieval affects both mnemonic and affective representations, providing a novel mechanistic basis for a well-known emotion regulation practice.

">Declarative Memory Through the Lens of Single-Trial Peaks in High-Frequency Power</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory depends on the coordination of local processing, indexed by high-frequency broadband (HFB) activity, with global network organization, indexed by theta oscillations. However, theta and HFB exhibit asynchronous timing, raising the question of how results of local processing are communicated throughout the network. Using intracranial EEG in patients performing a recognition memory task, we examined this coordination across the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). HFB peak activity was earlier in the MTL than PFC. Anchoring analyses of theta phase clustering and connectivity to HFB peaks revealed strong phase clustering locked to HFB peaks in the PFC, as well as connectivity between the PFC and MTL that predicted individual memory performance. Graph analysis revealed specific connections amidst sparse network connectivity during memory success. This study demonstrates that transient brain states linked to internal physiological events support memory and refines our understanding of local and network-level process interactions.

">Non-vectorial Integration of Intersectional Short-Pulse Stimulation Enables Enhanced Deep Brain Modulation and Effective Seizure Control</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) holds promise to treat neurological disorders, but its efficacy is limited by poor spatial focality and depth of penetration. Here, we examined the potential utility of Intersectional Short-Pulse (ISP) stimulation of deeper brain penetration. Using computational modeling and in vivo patch-clamp recordings in rats, we demonstrate that neurons integrate ISP-induced electric fields in a non-vectorial manner. This mechanism allows ISP to overcome some limits of conventional TES, achieving spatially limited stimulation across cortical and subcortical structures. In a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, closed-loop ISP stimulation significantly outperformed conventional TES in reducing seizure duration and severity. ISP reduced hippocampal seizure duration by 49% and 41% compared to sham stimulation and conventional TES and significantly reduced motor seizure severity. Our findings demonstrate that ISP stimulation can rapidly terminate hippocampal seizures, offering a potential new approach for non-invasive neuromodulation with applications across diverse neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

">Real-time fMRI neurofeedback reduces default mode network and auditory cortex functional connectivity in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Auditory verbal hallucinations (AHs) are a cardinal symptom of schizophrenia that can cause distress but are not always responsive to antipsychotic medications. There is a critical need to develop novel interventions that target neural mechanisms underlying AHs. We developed a real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) paradigm for AHs that aims at modulating default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders who were experiencing AHs (N = 25) attempted to decrease brain activation while listening to sentences recorded in another person's voice and increase brain activation while listening to sentences recorded in their own voice. Participants randomly assigned to the real group (n = 12) received neurofeedback based on signals from their auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and those assigned to the sham group (n = 13) received neurofeedback based on motor cortex signals. Analyzing resting state fMRI data collected pre- and post-NFB, we found that: (1) at baseline, stronger within-DMN connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex was associated with higher AHs severity; (2) after NFB, participants in the real group, compared to those in the sham group, showed greater reduction in functional connectivity between the MPFC and auditory cortices in the STG and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Notably, the reduction in MPFC-STG/MTG connectivity was found in all participants in the real group. These findings suggest that NFB can effectively and non-invasively modulate functional connectivity in regions associated with AHs in psychosis.

                The biological mechanisms underlying women's increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence remain undefined. Previous case/control studies have identified sex-biased molecular pathways, but sex-specific relationships between gene expression and AD endophenotypes, particularly sex chromosomes, are underexplored. With bulk transcriptomic data across 3 brain regions from 767 decedents, we investigated sex-specific associations between gene expression and post-mortem {beta}-amyloid and tau as well as antemortem longitudinal cognition. Of 23,118 significant gene associations, 10% were significant in one sex and not the other (sex-specific). Most sex-specific gene associations were identified in females (73%) and associated with tau tangles and longitudinal cognition (90%). Four X-linked genes, MCF2, HDAC8, FTX, and SLC10A3, demonstrated significant sex differences in their associations with AD endophenotypes (i.e., significant sex x gene interaction). Our results also uncovered sex-specific biological pathways, including a female-specific role of neuroinflammation and neuronal development, reinforcing the potential for sex-aware analyses to enhance precision medicine approaches in AD.

">State-dependent modulation of spiny projection neurons controls levodopa-induced dyskinesia in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                In the later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), patients often manifest levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), compromising their quality of life. The pathophysiology underlying LID is poorly understood, and treatment options are limited. To move toward filling this treatment gap, the intrinsic and synaptic changes in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) triggered by the sustained elevation of dopamine (DA) during dyskinesia were characterized using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular and behavioral approaches. Our studies revealed that the intrinsic excitability and functional corticostriatal connectivity of SPNs in dyskinetic mice oscillate between the on- and off-states of LID in a cell- and state-specific manner. Although triggered by levodopa, these rapid oscillations in SPN properties depended on both dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling. In a mouse PD model, disrupting M1 muscarinic receptor signaling specifically in iSPNs or deleting its downstream signaling partner CalDAG-GEFI blunted the levodopa-induced oscillation in functional connectivity, enhanced the beneficial effects of levodopa and attenuated LID severity.

">Brief disruption of the microbiome has age-dependent effects on morphine reward and gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex of adolescent and adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period for the initiation of problematic drug use, which significantly increases the risk of developing substance use disorders later in life. This heightened vulnerability is partly attributed to the immaturity of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region both essential for decision-making and implicated in drug reward. During adolescence, peripheral systems, such as the gut microbiome, also undergo substantial changes. Emerging evidence suggests that disruptions to the gut microbiome can influence gene expression and drug reward behaviors in rodent models. In this study, we investigated the effects of microbiome disruption on morphine reward and prefrontal cortical gene expression in adolescent and adult mice. Using oral antibiotics to transiently disrupt the microbiome, we found that short-term antibiotic exposure reduced morphine place preference specifically in adolescent mice. In a separate cohort, we observed that antibiotic treatment altered the transcriptomic response to morphine in the medial prefrontal cortex across all age groups. Notably, the transcriptomic changes induced by antibiotics and morphine were age-specific, with distinct gene expression patterns observed in adolescents compared to adults. These findings establish a foundation for future research into the role of the gut microbiome in opioid reward and highlight potential gene pathways underlying age-dependent differences in opioid sensitivity.

">Brain-Guided Convolutional Neural Networks Reveal Task-Specific Representations in Scene Processing</a></h4>

              
                Scene categorization is the dominant proxy for visual understanding, yet humans can perform a large number of visual tasks within any scene. Consequently, we know little about how different tasks change how the scene processed, represented, and its features ultimately used. Here, we developed a novel brain-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) where each convolutional layer was separately guided by neural responses taken at different time points while observers performed two different tasks on the same set of images. We then reconstructed each layer's activation maps via deconvolution to spatially assess how different features were used as a function of task. The brain-guided CNN made use of image features that human observers identified as being crucial to complete each task starting around 244 ms and persisted to 402 ms. Critically, because the same images were used across the two tasks, the CNN could only succeed if the neural data captured task-relevant differences. Our analyses of the activation maps across layers revealed that the brain's spatiotemporal representation of local image features evolves systematically over time. This underscores how distinct image features emerge at different stages of processing, shaped by the observer's goals and behavioral context.

">Enhanced CB1 receptor function in GABAergic neurons mediates hyperexcitability and impaired sensory-driven synchrony of cortical circuits in Fragile X Syndrome model mice</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO) display cortical hyperexcitability at rest, as well as deficits in sensory-driven cortical network synchrony. A form of circuit hyperexcitability is observed in ex vivo cortical slices of Fmr1 KO mice as prolonged persistent activity, or Up, states. It is unknown if the circuit mechanisms that cause prolonged Up states contribute to FXS-relevant EEG phenotypes. Here we examined the role of endocannabinoids (eCB) in prolonged Up states in slices and resting and sensory-driven EEG phenotypes in awake Fmr1 KO mice. Bidirectional changes in eCB function are reported in the Fmr1 KO that depend on synapse type (excitatory or inhibitory). We demonstrate that pharmacological or genetic reduction of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1R) in GABAergic neurons rescues prolonged cortical Up states and deficits in sensory-driven cortical synchrony in Fmr1 KO mice. In support of these findings, recordings from Fmr1 KO cortical Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons revealed enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of inhibitory synaptic currents. In contrast, genetic reduction of Cnr1 in glutamatergic neurons did not affect Up state duration, but deletion of Fmr1 in the same neurons was sufficient to cause long Up states. These findings support a model where loss of Fmr1 in glutamatergic neurons leads to enhanced CB1R-mediated suppression of GABAergic synaptic transmission, prolonged cortical circuit activation and reduced sensory-driven circuit synchronization. Results suggest that antagonism of CB1Rs as a therapeutic strategy to correct sensory processing deficits in FXS.

">Decreased auditory cortical activations and altered long-range alpha-band connectivity characterize passive auditory spatial attention in ASD</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication and sensory processing. The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.

">Brain Infiltrated Monocyte-Macrophages in a rat model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Revisiting the Pro-Inflammatory Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

">Visual experience contributes to separation of face and language responses in the ventral stream</a></h4>

              
                Human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) contains specialized regions that support visual recognition of behaviorally relevant categories, including faces, written language and places. An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC. Co-localization of face and language responses suggests an innate predisposition for communication-relevant processing in lateral vOTC.

                The nonlinear intramolecular dynamics of fluorescent indicators of neural activity can distort the accurate estimate of action potential (spike) times. In order to develop a more accurate spike inference algorithm we characterized the kinetic responses to different calcium concentrations of three popular calcium indicators (GCaMP6f, jGCaMP7f, and jGCaMP8f) using in vitro stopped-flow and brain slice recordings. jGCaMP8f showed a use-dependent slowing of fluorescence responses that caused existing inference methods to generate numerous false positives. From these data we developed multistate models of GcaMPs and used them to create a Bayesian Sequential Monte Carlo (BiophysSMC) and machine learning (BiophysML) inference methods that largely reduced false positives and improved the spike time accuracy from publicly available ground-truth data. The BiophysSMC method detected individual spikes with an average uncertainty of 6 milliseconds, a 6-fold improvement over previous methods. Our framework highlights the advantages of physical model-based approaches over model-free algorithms.

">The Drosophila EGF domain protein Uninflatable sets the switch between wrapping glia growth and axon wrapping instructed by Notch</a></h4>

              
                In the peripheral nervous system, sensory and motor axons are generally covered by wrapping glial cell processes. This neuron-glia interaction requires an intricate coordination of glial growth and differentiation. How this is controlled molecularly is largely unknown. At the example of Drosophila larval nerves, we show that glial growth is initially triggered by the FGF-receptor tyrosine kinase Heartless (Htl). In a screen for genes acting downstream of activated FGF-receptor, we identified the large membrane protein Uninflatable (Uif), which supports the formation of plasma membrane domains but not axon wrapping. Uif is also known to inhibit Notch. Surprisingly, we find that Notch signaling is required in postmitotic wrapping glia. While compromised Notch signaling results in a reduced wrapping efficiency, gain of Notch activity in wrapping glial cells leads to a hyperwrapping phenotype. Thus, Notch signaling is both necessary and sufficient for glial wrapping in Drosophila larvae. In addition, Notch suppresses both uif and htl function and thus stabilizes the switch between growth and differentiation. Given the general conservation of signaling mechanisms controlling glia development in mice and flies, similar mechanisms may act in the mammalian nervous system to control final glial differentiation.

">Using green space virtual reality to prevent stress-induced working memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to green space is associated with both physical and mental health benefits, including the potential to buffer acute stress responses, positioning it as a promising non-pharmacological approach to protect cognitive functions against stress. However, urban residents often face significant barriers in accessing green spaces, which are not equitably distributed. Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers a potential solution by simulating green space that could be made accessible to a broader demographic. Here, we explored whether VR-stimulated green space could dampen biological stress responses (i.e., heart rate and cortical response) and prevent stress-induced working memory (WM) impairment. Healthy young participants underwent acute stress induction followed by 15 minutes of VR-based green space (N=36) or control empty space (N=30) intervention. Although we observed the expected stress-induced increase in heart rates and elevated cortisol levels under stress, VR green space exposure failed to temper cortisol responses compared to the control VR space. Further, VR green space exposure did not bring benefits to protect working memory performance under stress across three WM tasks. Applying a Bayesian analysis approach throughout enabled us to find substantial evidence for the absence of an effect of VR-based green space exposure on biological markers of acute stress responses and working memory performance. Our findings suggest that VR-generated green space may not effectively replicate the stress-buffering effects of actual green space exposure. We discussed the implications of our findings regarding the potential and limitations of using VR or green space exposure to buffer stress responses.

">The mechanosensory DEG/ENaC channel DEGT-1 is a proprioceptor of C. elegans foregut movement</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal tract is subjected to extensive mechanosensory stimulation during food ingestion. However, the identities of mechanosensory receptors in the enteric nervous system are largely unknown. The pharynx of C. elegans is a structurally and functionally homologous model of the vertebrate foregut, but is comprised of only 20 neurons that are embedded within the muscles and epithelial cells of the organ. Here we report that the DEG/ENaC family ion channel DEGT-1 is a proprioceptor of pharynx movement. DEGT-1 protein is expressed in 4 pharyngeal neurons (MI, M3, I4, and M5) and localized to their neuronal soma in direct contact with the collagenous pharyngeal basement membrane. degt-1 mutants display abnormally rapid feeding in the presence of food, causing global changes in lipid accumulation. degt-1 mutants also pump rapidly when pumping is induced by the presence of serotonin alone, suggesting that DEGT-1 is required for proprioception of pharyngeal pumping itself, rather than sensing ingested food. DEGT-1 is required in only two pharyngeal neurons (I4 and M5) to control pumping rate. Taken together, these results suggest that DEGT-1 modulates pharyngeal pumping rate by relaying proprioceptive feedback generated by the shear force of the pharynx against its own basement membrane. Thus, mechanosensors in enteric nervous systems modulate organ function not only by detecting forces from ingested contents, but also the movements of the organ itself.

">Perturbing whole-brain models of brain hierarchy: an application for depression following pharmacological treatment</a></h4>

              
                Neural representation can extend beyond localised activity to encompass global patterns, where information is distributed across brain networks in a hierarchical manner. Recent research suggests that the hierarchy of causal influences shaping these patterns can serve as a signature of distinct brain states, with implications for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we first delve into how whole-brain models, guided by the Thermodynamics of Mind framework, can estimate the brain hierarchy of specific brain states, and how perturbations of such models can study the in-silico transitions to other states represented by static functional connectivity. We then show an application for major depressive disorder, where different brain hierarchical reconfigurations have been found following psilocybin and escitalopram treatments. We build whole-brain models of depressed patients before and after psilocybin and escitalopram interventions, and we carry a dynamic sensitivity analysis to explore the susceptibility of brain states and their drivability to healthier states. We show that susceptibility is on average reduced by escitalopram and increased by psilocybin, and that both treatments succeed in promoting healthier transitions. These results align with the post-treatment window of plasticity opened by serotonergic psychedelics, as well as with the similar clinical efficacy of both drugs observed in clinical trials.

">Assessing the role of BNST GABA neurons in backward conditioned suppression</a></h4>

              
                Conditioned suppression is a useful paradigm for measuring learned avoidance. In most conditioned suppression studies, forward conditioning is used where a cue predicts an aversive stimulus. However, backward conditioning, in which an aversive stimulus predicts a cue, provides unique insights into learned avoidance due to its influence on both conditioned excitation and inhibition. We trained mice to consume sucrose in context A, associated an aversive stimulus in context B to few or many forward or backwards paired cues (CS+), and then tested for conditioned suppression in context A in response to the CS+. We found that few or many forward CS+ and few backward CS+ produced conditioned suppression, but many backwards cues did not. Administration of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, prevented conditioned suppression to the backward CS+ but not to the forward CS+. Furthermore, freezing behavior was observed in response to the forward CS+ but not the backward CS+, and diazepam had no effect on freezing or locomotion. We next examined BNST GABA neurons for potential sensitivity to backwards cues and conditioned suppression. VGaT BNST signaling increased in response to sucrose licks during the backward CS+ but not to licks outside the CS+ and not to the backward CS+ onset or offset. Using designer receptors, we found that BNST VGaT neuron activation, but not its inhibition, prevented backward conditioned suppression expression. We conclude that backward conditioned suppression is dependent on both positive allosteric modulation of GABA on GABA-A receptors by diazepam and BNST GABA neurons.

">The role of STN beta oscillations on lower extremity muscle activity in Parkinsonian stepping</a></h4>

              
                Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) often resulting in disabling falls and loss of independence. It affects half of patients, yet current therapeutic strategies are insufficient, and the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated beta oscillation dynamics in the STN during different locomotor states, while examining the effects of levodopa. In particular, it aimed to identify pathological activity by analysing the relationship between the STN and lower limb muscles during stepping. Local field potentials (LFP) in the STN and muscle activity (EMG) of the gastrocnemius and peroneus longus were recorded in 14 PD patients during standing and stepping, ON and OFF levodopa. Levodopa reduced stepping variability, implying improved stepping abilities. Distinct STN beta patterns were observed between stepping and standing, with lower high-beta and higher low-beta during stepping compared to standing, suggesting a distinct role of these frequency bands in motor control during postural and movement states. Levodopa reduced low-beta but increased high-beta activity, highlighting a potential physiological function of high-beta in the STN during standing and stepping. In addition, step-phase specific effects of levodopa included reduced broad-beta band activity in the STN and lower limb muscles during the late-stance and pushing-off phase of the contralateral leg when ON medication. Further analyses suggest that pathological STN activity amplifies muscle activation around movement initiation, potentially reducing the ability of the patient to move freely. These findings offer insight for developing phase-specific stimulation strategies targeting STN beta oscillations during gait.

                Inflammation induced oligodendrocyte death and CNS demyelination, are key features of multiple sclerosis (MS). Inflammation-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress promote tissue damage in MS and in its preclinical animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Compound AA147 is a potent activator of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that can also induce antioxidant signaling through activation of the NRF2 pathway in neuronal cells. Previous work showed that AA147 protects multiple tissues against ischemia/reperfusion damage through ATF6 and/or NRF2 activation; however, its therapeutic potential in neuroinflammatory disorders remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that AA147 ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAE and reduced ER stress, oligodendrocyte loss, and demyelination. Additionally, AA147 suppressed T cells in the CNS without altering the peripheral immune response. Importantly, AA147 significantly increased the expressions of Grp78, an ATF6 target gene, in oligodendrocytes, while enhancing levels of Grp78 as well as Ho-1, an NRF2 target gene, in microglia. In cultured oligodendrocytes, AA147 promoted nuclear translocation of ATF6, but not NRF2. Intriguingly, AA147 altered the microglia activation profile, possibly by triggering the NRF2 pathway. AA147 was not therapeutically beneficial during the acute EAE stage in mice lacking ATF6 in oligodendrocytes, indicating that protection primarily involves ATF6 activation in these cells. Overall, our results suggest AA147 as a potential therapeutic opportunity for MS by promoting oligodendrocyte survival and regulating microglia status through distinct mechanisms.

">Neural circuits between nodose ganglion and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells regulate lung inflammatory responses</a></h4>

              
                The lungs are organs exposed to the external environment, and the air we inhale contains various pathogens, such as endotoxins. The vagus nerve, which innervates the lungs, may play a role in detecting pathogens that invade the lungs. Through transcriptome analysis, tissue clearance imaging, electrical excitability recording, and gene- and cell-specific knockout experiments, we found that vagus nerve endings innervate pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs). These nerve endings sense bacterial endotoxins via pain receptors (TRPA1) rather than toll-like receptors (TLR4), eliciting electrical excitation and enhancing the production of neuropeptides (CGRP) in the nodose ganglia. In turn, CGRP released by sensory neurons from the nodose ganglia promotes both neuropeptide production and the proliferation of PNECs, thereby amplifying endotoxin-induced lung inflammatory responses. This reveals that the neural circuits between the nodose ganglion and PNECs play a critical role in regulating lung inflammatory responses.

                CLN5 disease, a form of juvenile dementia within the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), is associated with mutations in the CLN5 gene encoding the lysosomal bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) synthase, essential for BMP production and lysosomal function. Limited knowledge of cellular mechanisms and unclear drug targets hinder translating this to children's treatment, which remains symptomatic. We developed and characterized a new cln5 knock-out zebrafish model that replicates key features and molecular signatures of the human disease. Loss of Cln5 function in vivo altered axonal growth of retinal ON-bipolar cells revealing new disease features. Additionally, multi-omic analyzes at different developmental stages, revealed an impaired glucose metabolism as an original finding in NCL. This work demonstrates the profound metabolic impact of CLN5 dysfunction, offering a promising avenue toward targeted therapies for juvenile dementia.

                Bayesian models, in which priors are used to optimally compensate for sensory uncertainty, have had wide-ranging success in explaining behavior across sensorimotor contexts. We recently reported, however, that humans and monkeys use a combination of Bayesian and non-Bayesian strategies when making categorical judgments of visual stability across saccades. While they used priors to compensate for internal, movement-driven sensory uncertainty, consistent with Bayesian predictions, they decreased their use of priors when faced with external, visual image uncertainty, an "anti-Bayesian" adjustment consistent with the use of a simple classifier. Here, we tested for neural correlates of these Bayesian and classifier-based strategies in the frontal eye field (FEF), a prefrontal region shown to be important for the perception of visual stability across saccades. We recorded from single FEF neurons while two rhesus macaques performed the internal (motor) and external (image) noise tasks in each session, interleaved trial by trial. FEF activity correlated with and predicted the anti-Bayesian, but not the Bayesian, behavior. These results suggest that the two computational strategies for visual stability are implemented by distinct neural circuits and provide a first step toward an integrated understanding of the computational and neural mechanisms underlying visual perception across saccades.

">The Hypno-PC: Uncovering Sleep Dynamics through Principal Component Analysis and Hidden Markov Modeling of Electrophysiological Signals</a></h4>

              
                The conventional approach to sleep analysis relies on pre-defined, visually scored stages derived from electrophysiological signals. This manual method demands substantial effort and is influenced by subjective assessments, implicitly assuming that these categories accurately reflect underlying biological processes. Recent advancements indicate that low-dimensional representations of complex brain activity can provide objective means of identifying brain states. These approaches can potentially uncover inherent patterns within sleep, offering valuable insights into its organization. In this study, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to spectral features extracted from high-density EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG recorded overnight at both 30- and 4-second resolutions. Notably, the first principal component-the "Hypno-PC"-strongly aligns with the hypnogram at both time scales. Subsequently, we employed a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) to delineate discrete states in the PCA-transformed data and to quantify their temporal dynamics. Using minimal supervision (less than 0.5% of the data labeled) and a cross-subject approach, the model achieved alignment with standard sleep labels comparable to the typical inter-rater agreement. Finally, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the PCA space, decomposing it into an independent set of components that potentially represent distinct physiological processes. The integrated use of PCA, GHMM, and ICA provides a reproducible and scalable methodology that aligns with traditional sleep staging, while offering a more flexible and comprehensive perspective on sleep states. Our findings indicate that these data-driven, unsupervised methods effectively uncover the intrinsic dynamics of sleep, advancing automated sleep analysis and enhancing our understanding of sleep organization.

">VGluT3 BNST neurons transmit GABA and restrict feeding without affecting rewarding or aversive processing</a></h4>

              
                The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in feeding, reward, aversion, and anxiety-like behavior. We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior.

">The Artists' Brain: A Data Fusion Approach to Characterize the Neural Bases of Professional Visual Artists</a></h4>

              
                Artistic creativity relies on complex perceptual, cognitive and motoric functions, yet the specific neural characterization of being an artist remain incompletely understood. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study aims to characterize the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) contributions to professional visual artists as compared to non-artists controls. The MRI brain scans of 12 professional artists and 12 matched non-artists were analyzed via an unsupervised machine learning method known as Transposed Independent Vector Analysis (tIVA) to detect joint GM-WM networks. Two independent networks were found. The first network (IC2), more expressed in artists, included increased GM-WM concentration in regions associated with the Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), and sensorimotor networks possibly related with augmented cognitive and ideational control, and increased perceptual-motor integration skills critical for creative tasks. The second network (IC8), less expressed in artists, included decreased GM-WM density in regions related to the Salience Network, such as the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, suggesting attentional regulation processes that may not be as central to visual artists. In sum, these results suggest that artists may rely on specialized brain networks, reflecting unique neural adaptations in individuals with pronounced creativity and extensive creative training.

	<p>Background: The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characteristic of difficulties in social communication and interaction has been previously associated with elevated anxiety and the degree of mental effort required to understand and respond to social cues. These associations have implications for the mental health of autistic youth, but they are usually based on correlational statistics between measures of anxiety and social interaction demands that are collected in formal psychological testing settings. Another index of mental effort that has been found to correlate with anxious arousal is gamma wave activity, which is measured via EEG. Methods: To compare data from both of these indicators of mental effort and anxiety, a two-stage study was conducted using (1) standardized test data and (2) in vivo EEG data in a low-demand social setting. Results: As well as significant associations between social cognition and anxiety from standardized scales, there were also meaningful relationships between social cognition and gamma wave activity. Conclusions: Because gamma wave activity represents the highest level of cognitive complexity for brain activity, is an index of hypervigilance under threatening conditions, and has been associated with anxiety in autistic youth, these findings suggest that even low-level demand social interaction settings may initiate high-level anxiety-related behaviour in autistic youth.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies on executive functions in child sex offenders relate their findings to the presence of pedophilia, but they are not able to distinguish between paraphilia and abuse. It is therefore this lack of a distinction that leads us to complement the existing information. Thus, the purpose of this review is to find all available evidence on the neurocognitive and neuroanatomical differences in executive functions among pedophilic and non-pedophilic child sex offenders, and non-offender pedophiles. Methods: The present review, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, ran a systematic search of three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest). This search identified 5697 potential articles, but only 16 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe, using a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample. Results: The results showed alterations in frontal, temporal and parietal structures related to executive functions (e.g., response inhibition) in child sexual offenders, regardless of the presence of pedophilia. Conclusions: In summary, there are differences in brain structure underlying executive functions related to child sexual abuse, but not to pedophilia as such.</p>

                <p>Brain oscillations in the alpha-band (8&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) have been linked to specific processes in attention and perception. In particular, decreases in posterior alpha-amplitude are thought to reflect activation of perceptually relevant brain areas for target engagement, while alpha-amplitude increases have been associated with inhibition for distractor suppression. Traditionally, these alpha-changes have been viewed as two facets of the same process. However, recent evidence calls for revisiting this interpretation. Here, we recorded MEG/EEG in 32 participants (19 females) during covert visuospatial attention shifts (spatial cues) and two control conditions (neutral cue, no-attention cue), while tracking fixational eye movements. In disagreement with a single, perceptually relevant alpha-process, we found the typical alpha-modulations contra- and ipsilateral to the attention focus to be triple dissociated in their timing, topography, and spectral features: Ipsilateral alpha-increases occurred early, over occipital sensors, at a high alpha-frequency (10&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) and were expressed during spatial attention (alpha spatial cue &gt; neutral cue). In contrast, contralateral alpha-decreases occurred later, over parietal sensors, at a lower alpha-frequency (7&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) and were associated with attention deployment in general (alpha spatial and neutral cue &lt; no-attention cue). Additionally, the lateralized early alpha-increases but not alpha-decreases during spatial attention coincided in time with directionally biased microsaccades. Overall, this suggests that the attention-related early alpha-increases and late alpha-decreases reflect distinct, likely reflexive versus endogenously controlled attention mechanisms. We conclude that there is more than one perceptually relevant posterior alpha-oscillation, which need to be dissociated for a detailed account of their roles in perception and attention.</p>

                <p>Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions retain increased densities of microglia and macrophages. In acute SCI, macrophages induce growth cone collapse and facilitate axon retraction away from lesion boundaries. Little is known about the role of sustained inflammation in chronic SCI or whether chronic inflammation affects regeneration. We used the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor, PLX-5622, to deplete microglia and macrophages months after complete crush SCI in female mice. Transcriptional analyses revealed a significant inflammatory depletion within chronic SCI lesions after PLX-5622 treatment. Both transcriptional analyses and immunohistochemistry revealed that Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells repopulate to predepleted densities after treatment removal. Neuronal-enriched transcripts were significantly elevated in mice after inflammatory repopulation, but no significant effects were observed with inflammatory depletion alone. Axon densities also significantly increased within the lesion after PLX-5622 treatment and after repopulation. To better examine the effect of chronic inflammation on axon regeneration, we tested PLX-5622 treatment in neuronal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) knock-out (PTEN-KO) mice. PTEN-KO was delivered using spinal injections of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg's). PTEN-KO did not further increase axon densities within the lesion beyond the effects induced by PLX-5622. Axons that grew within the lesion were histologically identified as 5-HT<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>+</sup>, both of which are not robustly transduced by AAVrg's. Our work identified that increased macrophage/microglial densities in the chronic SCI environment may be actively retained by homeostatic mechanisms likely affiliated with a sustained elevated expression of CSF1 and other chemokines. Finally, we identify a novel role of sustained inflammation as a prospective barrier to axon regeneration in chronic SCI.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in motor function through the coordination of dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes, such as DRD1 and DRD2, thus the functional imbalance of these receptors can lead to Parkinson's disease. However, due to the complexity of dopaminergic circuits in the brain, it is limited to investigating the individual functions of each DRD subtype in specific brain regions. Here, we developed a light-responsive chimeric DRD2, OptoDRD2, which can selectively activate DRD2-like signaling pathways with spatiotemporal resolution. OptoDRD2 was designed to include the light-sensitive component of rhodopsin and the intracellular signaling domain of DRD2. Upon illumination with blue light, OptoDRD2 triggered DRD2-like signaling pathways, such as G&alpha;i/o subtype recruitment, a decrease in cAMP levels, and ERK phosphorylation. To explore unknown roles of DRD2 in glutamatergic cell populations of basal ganglia circuitry, OptoDRD2 was genetically expressed in excitatory neurons in lateral globus pallidus (LGP) of the male mouse brain. The optogenetic stimulation of OptoDRD2 in the LGP region affected a wide range of locomotion-related parameters, such as increased frequency of movement and decreased immobility time, resulting in the facilitation of motor function of living male mice. Therefore, our findings indicate a potentially novel role for DRD2 in the excitatory neurons of the LGP region, suggesting that OptoDRD2 can be a valuable tool enabling the investigation of unknown roles of DRD2 at specific cell types or brain regions.</p>

                <p>The homeostatic regulation of pulmonary ventilation, and ultimately arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>, depends on interactions between respiratory chemoreflexes and arousal state. The ventilatory response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> is triggered by neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that function as sensors of central pH, which can be identified in adulthood by the expression of Phox2b and neuromedin B. Here, we examine the dynamic response of genetically defined RTN neurons to hypercapnia and arousal state in freely behaving adult male and female mice using the calcium indicator jGCaMP7 and fiber photometry. We found that hypercapnia vigorously activates RTN neurons with a low CO<SUB>2</SUB> recruitment threshold and with response kinetics that match respiratory activity whereas hypoxia had little effect. RTN activity increased transiently during wakefulness and respiratory-related arousals and rose persistently during rapid eye movement sleep, and their CO<SUB>2</SUB> response persisted under anesthesia. Complementary studies using inhibitory optogenetics show that RTN activity supports eupneic breathing under anesthesia as well as during states of high arousal, but their activity is redundant for voluntary breathing patterns. Collectively, this study demonstrates that CO<SUB>2</SUB>-activated RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to the arousal state, which determines their contribution to alveolar ventilation in relation to arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

                <p>Age-related changes in the BOLD response could reflect neurovascular coupling modifications rather than simply impairments in neural functioning. In this study, we propose the use of a sparse dynamic causal model (sDCM) to decouple neuronal and vascular factors in the BOLD signal, with the aim of characterizing the whole-brain spatial pattern of hemodynamic sensitivity to healthy aging, as well as to test the role of hemodynamic features as independent predictors in an age-classification model. sDCM was applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a cohort of 126 healthy individuals in a wide age range (31 females), providing reliable estimates of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each subject and each region of interest. Then, some features characterizing each HRF curve were extracted and used to fit a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the age class of each individual. Ultimately, we tested the final predictive model on an independent dataset of 338 healthy subjects (173 females) selected from the Human Connectome Project in Aging and Development cohorts. Our results entail the spatial heterogeneity of the age effects on the hemodynamic component, since its impact resulted to be strongly region- and population-specific, discouraging any space-invariant&ndash;corrective procedures that attempt to correct for vascular factors when carrying out functional studies involving groups with different ages. Moreover, we demonstrated that a strong interaction exists between certain right-hemisphere hemodynamic features and age, further supporting the essential role of the hemodynamic factor as independent predictor of biological aging, rather than a simple confounding variable.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e2284232024?rss=1">Early Neural Development of Social Interaction Perception: Evidence from Voxel-Wise Encoding in Young Children and Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a young age, children have advanced social perceptual and reasoning abilities. However, the neural development of these abilities is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fMRI data collected while 122 3&ndash;12-year-old children (64 females) and 33 adults (20 females) watched an engaging and socially rich movie to investigate how the cortical basis of social processing changes throughout development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face and a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, valence, and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model trained on these features, we found that models based on visual (motion energy) and social (faces, social interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can both predict brain activity in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old across the cortex, with particularly high predictivity in motion-selective middle temporal region and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, models based on individual social features showed that while there may be some development throughout childhood, social interaction information in the STS is present in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old and appears adult-like by age 7. The current study, for the first time, links neural activity in children to predefined social features in a narrative movie and suggests social interaction perception is supported by early developing neural responses in the STS.</p>

                <p>Learning occurs across multiple timescales, with fast learning crucial for adapting to sudden environmental changes, and slow learning beneficial for extracting robust knowledge from multiple events. Here, we asked if miscalibrated fast vs slow learning can lead to maladaptive decision-making in individuals with problem gambling. We recruited participants with problem gambling (PG; N = 20; 9 female and 11 male) and a recreational gambling control group without any symptoms associated with PG (N = 20; 10 female and 10 male) from the community in Los Angeles, CA. Participants performed a decision-making task involving reward-learning and loss-avoidance while being scanned with fMRI. Using computational model fitting, we found that individuals in the PG group showed evidence for an excessive dependence on slow timescales and a reduced reliance on fast timescales during learning. fMRI data implicated the putamen, an area associated with habit, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in slow loss-value encoding, with significantly more robust encoding in medial PFC in the PG group compared to controls. The PG group also exhibited stronger loss prediction error encoding in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that individuals with PG have an impaired ability to adjust their predictions following losses, manifested by a stronger influence of slow value learning. This impairment could contribute to the behavioral inflexibility of problem gamblers, particularly the persistence in gambling behavior typically observed in those individuals after incurring loss outcomes.</p>

                <p>Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has regenerative potentials to treat various pathological conditions including neurological diseases. MSCs isolated from various organs can differentiate into specific cell types to repair organ damages. However, their paracrine mechanisms are predicted to predominantly mediate their immunomodulatory, proangiogenic, and regenerative properties. While preclinical studies highlight the significant potential of MSC therapy in mitigating neurological damage from stroke and traumatic brain injury, the variability in clinical trial outcomes may stem from the inherent heterogeneity of somatic MSCs. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an ideal alternative resource for the unlimited expansion and biomanufacturing of MSCs. Thus, we investigated how iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) influence properties of iPSC-derived neurons. Our findings demonstrate that the secretome from iMSCs possesses neurotrophic effects, improving neuronal survival and promoting neuronal outgrowth and synaptic activity in vitro. Additionally, the iMSCs enhance metabolic activity via mitochondrial respiration in neurons, both in vitro and in mouse models. Glycolytic pathways also increased following the administration of iMSC secretome to iPSC-derived neurons. Consistently, in vivo experiments showed that intravenous administration of iMSCs compensated for the elevated energetic demand in male mice with irradiation-induced brain injury by restoring synaptic metabolic activity during acute brain damage. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging also detected an increase in brain glucose uptake following iMSC administration. Together, our results highlight the potential of iMSC-based therapy in treating neuronal damage in various neurological disorders, while paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications of iMSCs in regenerative medicine.</p>

                <p>Although the therapeutic potential of microRNA-mediated gene regulation has been investigated, its precise functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate that miR-216a-3p serves as a critical noncoding RNA involved in the modulation of trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. By conducting RNA-seq and qPCR analysis, we observed a notable decrease of miR-216a-3p in the injured trigeminal ganglia (TG) of male rats. Intra-TG administration of miR-216a-3p agomir or lentiviral-mediated overexpression of miR-216a-3p specifically in sensory neurons of injured TGs alleviated established neuropathic pain behaviors, while downregulation of miR-216a-3p (pharmacologically or genetically) in naive rats induced pain behaviors. Moreover, nerve injury significantly elevated the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels in the ipsilateral TG, thereby suppressing the SRY-box TF 10 (SOX10) binding to the <I>miR-216a-3p</I> promoter and resulting in the reduction of miR-216a-3p. Inhibiting the enzymes responsible for catalyzing H3K27me3 restored the nerve injury-induced reduction in miR-216a-3p expression and markedly ameliorated neuropathic pain behaviors. Furthermore, miR-216a-3p targeted stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and the decreased miR-216a-3p associated with neuropathic pain caused a significant upregulation in the protein abundance of STIM1. Conversely, overexpression of miR-216a-3p in the injured TG suppressed the upregulation of STIM1 expression and reversed the mechanical allodynia. Together, the mechanistic understanding of H3K27me3-dependent SOX10/miR-216a-3p/STIM1 signaling axial in sensory neurons may facilitate the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain management.</p>

                <p>The interplay between attention, alertness, and motor planning is crucial for our manual interactions. To investigate the neural bases of this interaction and challenge the views that attention cannot be disentangled from motor planning, we instructed human volunteers of both sexes to plan and execute reaching movements while attending to the target, while attending elsewhere, or without constraining attention. We recorded reaction times to reach initiation and pupil diameter and interfered with the functions of the medial posterior parietal cortex (mPPC) with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the causal role of this cortical region in the interplay between spatial attention and reaching. We found that mPPC plays a key role in the spatial association of reach planning and covert attention. Moreover, we have found that alertness, measured by pupil size, is a good predictor of the promptness of reach initiation only if we plan a reach to attended targets, and mPPC is causally involved in this coupling. Different from previous understanding, we suggest that mPPC is neither involved in reach planning per se, nor in sustained covert attention in the absence of a reach plan, but it is specifically involved in attention functional to reaching.</p>

                <p>Intracranial potentials are used as functional biomarkers of neural networks. As potentials spread away from the source populations, they become mixed in the recordings. In humans, interindividual differences in the gyral architecture of the cortex pose an additional challenge, as functional areas vary in location and extent. We used source separation techniques to disentangle mixing potentials obtained by exploratory deep arrays implanted in epileptic patients of either sex to gain access to the number, location, relative contribution, and dynamics of coactive sources. The unique spatial profiles of separated generators made it possible to discern dozens of independent cortical areas for each patient, whose stability maintained even during seizure, enabling the follow up of activity for days and across states. Through matching these profiles to MRI, we associated each with limited portions of sulci and gyri and determined the local or remote origin of the corresponding sources. We also plotted source-specific 3D coverage across arrays. In average, individual recording sites are contributed to by 3&ndash;5 local and distant generators from areas up to several centimeters apart. During seizure, 13&ndash;85% of generators were involved, and a few appeared anew. Significant bias in location assignment using raw potentials is revealed, including numerous false positives when determining the site of origin of a seizure. This is not amended by bipolar montage, which introduce additional errors of its own. In this way, source disentangling reveals the multisource nature and far intracranial spread of potentials in humans, while efficiently addressing patient-specific anatomofunctional cortical divergence.</p>

                <p>Neonatal hypoxia (Hx) causes white matter (WM) injury, particularly in the cerebellum. We previously demonstrated that Hx-induced reduction of cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) activity results in locomotor deficits. Yet, the mechanism of Hx-induced cerebellar WM injury and associated locomotor abnormalities remains undetermined. Here, we show that the cerebellar WM injury and linked locomotor deficits are driven by PC activity and are reversed when PC activity is restored. Using optogenetics and multielectrode array recordings, we manipulated PC activity and captured the resulting cellular responses in WM oligodendrocyte precursor cells and GABAergic interneurons. To emulate the effects of Hx, we used light-activated halorhodopsin targeted specifically to the PC layer of normal mice. Suppression of PC firing activity at P13 and P21 phenocopied the locomotor deficits observed in Hx. Moreover, histopathologic analysis of the developing cerebellar WM following PC inhibition (P21) revealed a corresponding reduction in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, akin to our findings in Hx mice. Conversely, PC stimulation restored PC activity, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation, and enhanced myelination, resulting in reversed Hx-induced locomotor deficits. Our findings highlight the crucial role of PC activity in cerebellar WM development and locomotor performance following neonatal injury. </p>

">Auditory tract maturation in early infancy: Links to speech production</a></h4>

              
                Infants exhibit remarkable language acquisition abilities, supported by highly plastic neural substrates that dynamically interact with early speech experiences. However, the developmental mechanisms of these neural substrates and their specific role in speech acquisition remain incompletely understood. Here, we present NeoAudi Tract (NAT), a robust automated toolbox for extracting the full set of auditory tracts in infants from birth to 24 months using $3$T diffusion MRI data. By characterizing the microstructural changes in these tracts, we demonstrate a gradual and continuous maturation process of the auditory system. Additionally, we identify significant correlations between auditory tract maturation and both textit{fine-motor skills} and textit{expressive language} $t$-scores from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning tests. Our findings highlight the role of the auditory system in speech production and indicate the intertwined development of auditory and motor systems that underlies speech acquisition, particularly during perceptual reorganization.

">Developmental synaptic pruning in the olivo-cerebellar circuit sculpts predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic pruning is a dominant process of circuit assembly, known to eliminate a large proportion of synapses formed during development. Yet, very little is understood about how the drastic elimination of a large number of synapses affects circuit computation and behavior. Here, using the olivocerebellar system of larval zebrafish, we first establish the timelines of olivary climbing fiber to Purkinje neuron synaptic pruning. We then show that during this window, encoding of sensory-motor mismatches is improved, sensory representations are fine-tuned, and predictive signals are more robust. All of these lead to faster and better behavioral responses which are adaptable to current sensory input. Thus, developmental synaptic pruning makes circuits fit for complex computations such as predictive processing.

">Rotationally Stable Dynamics Over Long Timescales Emerge in Neuronal Development</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal networks must balance the need for stable yet flexible dynamics. This is evident during brain development, when synaptic plasticity during critical windows enables adaptability to changing environments whilst ensuring the stability of population dynamics. The emergence of population dynamics that balance stability and flexibility during development is poorly understood. Here, we investigated developmental brain dynamics in larval zebrafish, using in vivo 2-photon imaging to record single-cell activity across major brain regions from 3-8 days post-fertilisation, a highly plastic period in which hunting behaviours are established. Our findings revealed region-specific trajectories in the development of such dynamic regimes: the telencephalon exhibited increased neuronal excitability and long-range correlations, alongside the emergence of scale invariant avalanche dynamics indicative of enhanced flexibility. Conversely, while other regions showed increased state transitions over development, the telencephalon demonstrated a surprising rise in state stability, characterized by slightly longer dwell times and drastically reduced angular velocity in state space. Remarkably, such rotationally stable dynamics persisted up to 5 seconds into the future, indicating the emergence of strong attractors supporting stability over long timescales. Notably, we observed that telencephalon dynamics were maintained near to but not at a phase transition, thus allowing for robust responses while remaining adaptable to novel inputs. Our results highlight regionally-specific trajectories in the relationship between flexibility and stability, illustrating how developing neuronal populations can self-organize to balance these competing demands.

">Nurr1 orchestrates claustrum development and functionality</a></h4>

              
                Claustrum is known the most widely interconnected tissue with almost all brain subareas to coordinate multiple cognitive behaviors in spite of the lasting controversy on its role in consciousness formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and behavioral control. Here we show that Nurr1 (Nr4a2) is the key factor orchestrating claustral morphogenesis, functional connectivity and thus behaviors. Nurr1 deficient claustral cells over-migrate into insular cortex, shaping claustrum into an abnormal wing-like structure, and ectopically turn on insular cortical genetic program. Accordingly, functional connectivity associated with claustrum and relevant behaviors are dysregulated by Nurr1 deficiency. Additionally, Nurr1 regulates claustral neuron positioning by suppressing G-protein signaling.

	<p>Background: The Default Mode Network (DMN) is involved in self-referential and emotional processes, while the insula integrates emotional and interoceptive signals. Functional connectivity between the insula and the DMN is proposed to enhance these processes by linking internal bodily states with self-referential thoughts and emotional regulation. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a measure of parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, has been associated with the capacity to regulate autonomic arousal. This study explored the relationship between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN functional connectivity and HRV. We hypothesized that (1) insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional activity and volume would be related to HRV; (2) insula activation would be functionally connected with the DMN; and (3) stronger insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity would correlate with higher HRV. Methods: Forty-three healthy adults underwent a structural and functional MRI acquisition to assess insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity during resting state. HRV was measured also at rest using the BIOPAC system. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity, but no correlation was observed between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity and HRV. We also found a positive significant association between left insula volume and HRV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while the AI and DMN are functionally interconnected, this connectivity may not be directly related to HRV. The results highlight the complexity of the relationship between brain connectivity and autonomic function, suggesting that other factors may influence HRV.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is a validated procedure for the treatment of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. To select shunt-responsive patients, infusion and tap tests can be used. Only gait is evaluated after the procedure to establish a potential improvement. In this study, we present our Hydro-Real-Time Neuropsychological Testing protocol to assess the feasibility of performing an ultra-fast assessment of patients during the infusion and tap test. Methods: We tested 57 patients during the infusion and tap test to obtain real-time feedback on their cognitive status. Data were obtained immediately before the infusion phase (T0), when the pressure plateau was reached (T1), and immediately after cerebrospinal fluid subtraction (T2). Based on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, 63.15% of the patients presented a resistance to outflow &amp;amp;gt; 12 mmHg/mL/min, while 88% had a positive tap test response. Results: Compared to T0, cerebrospinal fluid removal significantly improved performance on tasks exploring executive functions (counting backward, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; verbal fluency, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients were significantly faster at counting backward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and were significantly faster at counting forward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005), suggesting an improvement in speed at T2. There was a significantly smaller index at T1 vs. T0 (p = 0.005) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), suggesting a more marked improvement in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; executive abilities at T2 and a smaller improvement at T1. Regarding verbal fluency, patients were worse at T1 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients&amp;amp;rsquo; performance can be monitored during the infusion and tap test as significant changes in executive functions are observable. In future, this protocol might help improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; selection for surgery.</p>

<p>Retinal abnormalities are observed in the early stages of neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Detection of retinal abnormalities in early stage, can prevent the increase in neurological diseases.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurological diseases are central nervous system (CNS) disorders affecting the whole body. Early diagnosis of the diseases is difficult due to the lack of disease-specific tests. Adding new biomarkers external to the CNS facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. In this respect, the retina has a common embryologic origin with the CNS. Retinal imaging technologies including optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used in the understanding and processual monitoring of neurological diseases. Retinal imaging has been recently recognized as a potential source of biomarkers for neurological diseases, increasing the number of studies in this direction. In this review, the association of retinal abnormalities with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained. Structural and functional abnormalities in retina as a predictive marker may facilitate early diagnosis of diseases. Although not all retinal abnormalities are predictive of neurologic diseases, changes in the retinal layers including retinal pigment epithelium and plexiform layers should suggest the risk of PD, MS, ALS, and AD.</p>

<p>Striatonigral dopamine D1 receptors' signal asymmetrically producing more cAMP and GABA release at their terminals, which produces higher motor activity initiated in the right hemisphere respect left when receptors are activated.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lateralization of motor behavior, a common phenomenon in humans and several species, is modulated by the basal ganglia, a site pointed out for the interhemispheric differences related to lateralization. Our study aims to shed light on the potential role of the striatonigral D1 receptor in functional asymmetry in normal conditions through neurochemical and behavioral means. We found that D1 receptor activation and D1/D3 receptor coactivation in striatonigral neurons leads to more cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase in the striatum and GABA release in their terminals in the right hemisphere compared to the left. These differences are linked to a higher receptor sensitivity and potentially a better coupling of G<sub>olf</sub> proteins. When we assessed motor behavior through intranigral injection of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 in the left or right substantia nigra, we found higher contralateral circling when injected on the right side. Thus, differences in motor activity correlate with neurochemical data, indicating that D1 receptor signaling plays a significant role in motor asymmetry.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, research in humans and in the nonhuman primate model of human amnesia revealed that tasks involving free viewing of images provided an exceptionally sensitive measure of recognition memory. Performance on these tasks was sensitive to damage restricted to the hippocampus as well as to damage that included medial temporal lobe cortices. Early work in my laboratory used free-viewing tasks to assess the neurophysiological correlates of recognition memory, and the use of naturalistic visual exploration opened rich avenues to assess other aspects of the impact of eye movements on neural activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Here, I summarize two main lines of this work and some of the stories of the trainees who made essential contributions to these discoveries.</p>

                Mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 OXPHOS subunits, which are synthesized inside the organelle. To address how mitochondrial gene expression integrates into cellular physiology, Yousefi et al. established a fluorescence-based high-throughput screen for mitochondrial translation, combining fluorescent labeling of mitochondrial translation products with siRNA-mediated knockdown. This work identifies kinases affecting mitochondrial translation.

Notably, adaptive responses of immune cells to hypoxia and oxidative stress are observed during extreme-altitude mountaineering.

                Ruggieri et al. developed a spatial transcriptomics dataset of skeletal muscle from the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model. Their findings highlight polyamine metabolism’s role in muscle fiber vulnerability, showing that disruptions of this metabolic pathway cause muscle defects, while restoring polyamine balance improves muscle function in diseased mice.

                Mohamed et al. report the cryoelectron microscopy structure of human AGO2 with fully paired guide RNA. Their analysis reveals the structural basis for the slicing activity that drives RNAi, showing that the slicing-competent conformation is achieved by domain movements and RNA-protein contacts distinct from those of conformational intermediates and prokaryotic homologs.

                H3.3 is a key maternal factor essential for chromatin remodeling. Zhang et al. generate a parental allele-derived H3.3 genome-wide landscape using a H3.3B-HA mouse model and provide insights into the role of maternal H3.3 in minor zygotic genome activation by establishing acetylation at lysine 27.

                Teng et al. report a specific population of GABAergic neurons in the vBNST regulate the response to unpredictable threats via coordinated inputs from the IC and CeL. vBNST-vlPAG and vBNST-CeM circuits govern freezing and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. They propose that targeting KCNQ3 could treat anxiety disorders by stabilizing vBNST activity.

                Mantegna et al. investigated interareal communication during covert speech using magnetoencephalography. They observed distinct hemispheric lateralization patterns before and after expected covert production. Their findings suggest that covert speech involves a parallel neural architecture similar to overt speech, with leftward and rightward lateralization corresponding to feedforward and feedback signals, respectively.
