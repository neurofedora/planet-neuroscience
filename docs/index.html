              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06645">Quantifying Uncertainty in Error Consistency: Towards Reliable Behavioral Comparison of Classifiers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06326">Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Controller for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency, exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time, resource-constrained neuromodulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06381">KPFlow: An Operator Perspective on Dynamic Collapse Under Gradient Descent Training of Recurrent Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations, especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow, which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure, over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow}, implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD learning in non-linear recurrent models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11654">Equivalence of stationary dynamical solutions in a directed chain and a Delay Differential Equation of neuroscientific relevance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While synchronized states, and the dynamical pathways through which they emerge, are often regarded as the paradigm to understand the dynamics of information spreading on undirected networks of nonlinear dynamical systems, when we consider directed network architectures, dynamical stationary states can arise. To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network, a single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show numerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a self-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit cycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then formulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in terms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an explicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of mapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is shown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not destabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in general between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed as the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of solutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature accurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a solitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06461">Energy-Efficient Supervised Learning with a Binary Stochastic Forward-Forward Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist; here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units. Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity, combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one order of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06817">Designing Robust Software Sensors for Nonlinear Systems via Neural Networks and Adaptive Sliding Mode Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the state variables in a dynamical system is critical for effective control, diagnosis, and supervision, especially when direct measurements of all states are infeasible. This paper presents a novel approach to designing software sensors for nonlinear dynamical systems expressed in their most general form. Unlike traditional model-based observers that rely on explicit transformations or linearization, the proposed framework integrates neural networks with adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to design a robust state observer under a less restrictive set of conditions. The learning process is driven by available sensor measurements, which are used to correct the observer's state estimate. The training methodology leverages the system's governing equations as a physics-based constraint, enabling observer synthesis without access to ground-truth state trajectories. By employing a time-varying gain matrix dynamically adjusted by the neural network, the observer adapts in real-time to system changes, ensuring robustness against noise, external disturbances, and variations in system dynamics. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee estimation error convergence, establishing a theoretical foundation for the observer's reliability. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulations on challenging examples, including systems with non-differentiable dynamics and varying observability conditions. These examples, which are often problematic for conventional techniques, serve to demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our approach. The results show rapid convergence and high accuracy, underscoring the method's potential for addressing complex state estimation challenges in real-world applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12982">Multi-parameter Control for the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA on OneMax via Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Numerosity estimation refers to the ability to perceive and estimate quantities without explicit counting, a skill crucial for both human and animal cognition. Traditionally, this process has been associated with higher-order cortical regions like the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), thought to support abstract number representations. However, noninvasive electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, along with psychophysical investigations, suggest that early visual areas such as V1 and V2 may play a role in processing visual numerosity, similar to the way low-level visual features are encoded. Recent research shows that the early visual cortex encodes information related to numerosity through the spatial frequency content of visual displays. Numerosity-tuned neurons, however, emerge later in the visual processing hierarchy, where more abstract and location-independent representations are formed in association areas such as the IPS and PFC. This is further supported by single-neuron data revealing spatiotopic integration and tuning curves for specific numerosities within these associative cortical regions. A comprehensive understanding of numerosity processing in the brain requires investigating numerosity presentations across time, space, and sensory modalities, all of which engage association cortices rather than sensory-specific regions.</span>

This study investigates the roles of theta and alpha oscillations in these processes during a Go/Nogo task, with a sample size of 73 healthy participants, using a novel application of non-negative tensor decomposition. The Non-negative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC algorithm was applied to multi-dimensional EEG data to preserve critical spatial, temporal, and spectral information. Results revealed that mid-frontal theta band activity is strongly associated with the reconfiguration of perception-action associations, particularly during overlapping Nogo trials, where cognitive demands are heightened. Alpha band activity, while less prominent, was also detected, indicating its involvement in top-down inhibitory control during conditions requiring less cognitive reconfiguration. These findings suggest complementary roles for theta and alpha oscillations, with theta playing a dominant role in managing perception-action associations. Tensor decomposition provides an effective means to capture complex neural signatures, offering deeper insights into the oscillatory dynamics that underlie cognitive control processes.

                <p>Sensorimotor integration processes are crucial for daily-life activities, such as grasping objects or driving a car. Theta band activity (TBA) in distributed brain networks is likely essential to perform sensorimotor integration successfully. Directed communication in these brain networks is shaped by brain maturation during adolescence. This study investigates how age-related effects attributable to brain maturation influence directed communication in a theta-associated sensorimotor integration network. We conducted an EEG study with a continuous pursuit-tracking task performed by an adult group (<I>n</I> = 41) and an adolescent group (<I>n</I> = 30), each including both sexes. Both groups show elevated theta band activity during higher sensorimotor demands. Yet, the adult group outperformed the adolescent group, particularly during higher demands. Further analyses revealed that this is likely due to enhanced directed connectivity between frontal areas and the ventral processing stream in adults, which likely enables effective integration of visual and motor information. Adolescents rely on frontal TBA signaling surprise and prediction error, with no input from ventral stream areas. This might cause lower performance during higher demands. Across age, TBA appears to serve distinct functions during sensorimotor integration. Age-related processes transform the neural processes underlying complex sensorimotor integration.</p>

                <p>The circadian rhythm shapes behavioral processes by providing temporal cues for molecular regulation and adaptation in the hypothalamus of the brain. Deeper yet in the striatum of the brain, circadian rhythm also exerts an impact, conditioning diurnal patterns in neurodegenerative-related motor dysfunction. While motor properties are clearly linked to striatal dopamine, the interplay between the circadian rhythm with the key circadian transcription factor Bmal1 and dopamine signal decoding remains unknown. Here, we utilized both sexes of global and local striatal Bmal1 knock-out mice to investigate changes in dopamine-mediated cAMP signaling and motor behavior. By conducting a 24&nbsp;h time-course study, we first established Bmal1-dependent molecular signatures in striatal dopamine signaling machinery that correlated with cAMP levels. Next, recording real-time signal transduction with a two-photon FRET biosensor in brain slices revealed diminished efficacy of dopamine signaling in the absence of Bmal1. As a final functional outcome, we then found that striatal Bmal1 was necessary for motor learning in mice. Altogether, our data support a strong connection between striatal Bmal1 and dopamine signaling with potential impact in brain-related motor function.</p>

                <p>The error negativity or error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in choice tasks, is related to posterror adjustments indicating that it signals the need for behavioral adjustments following errors. However, little is known about how the error monitoring system selects appropriate posterror adjustments for a given error to ensure that future errors are effectively prevented. This could be achieved by monitoring error precursors indicating potential error sources and then scaling the Ne/ERN according to the strength of the error precursor upon error occurrence. We isolated such an error precursor in alpha oscillations and tested whether it predicts the size of the Ne/ERN. A total of 28 participants (23 female, 5 male) had to classify a target in one hemifield but ignore a distractor in the opposite hemifield. Because responding to the distractor always led to an error, misallocating spatial attention to the distractor as reflected in posterior alpha was a viable error precursor in this paradigm. We found that an alpha asymmetry reversal indicated a shift of spatial attention to the distractor on error trials and predicted the Ne/ERN on a single-trial level. The Ne/ERN in turn predicted alpha asymmetry on the next trial indicating a shift of spatial attention away from the distractor. This is consistent with the idea that the error monitoring system scales the Ne/ERN according to the strength of error precursors to select appropriate posterror adjustments of behavior.</p>

                <p>Visual information consists of static and dynamic properties. How is their representation organized in the visual system? Static information has been associated with ventral temporal regions while dynamic information with lateral and dorsal regions. Investigating the representation of static and dynamic information is complicated by the correlation between static and dynamic information within continuous visual input. Here, we used two-stream deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to separate static and dynamic features in quasi-naturalistic videos and to investigate their neural representations. The first DCNN stream was trained to represent static features by recognizing action labels using individual video frames, and the second DCNN stream was trained to encode dynamic features by recognizing actions from optic flow information that describes changes across different frames. To investigate the representation of these different types of features in the visual system, we used representational similarity analysis to compare the neural network models to the neural responses in different visual pathways of 14 human participants (six females). First, we found that both static and dynamic features are encoded across all visual pathways. Second, we found that distinct visual pathways represent overlapping as well as unique static and dynamic visual information. Finally, multivariate analysis revealed that ventral and dorsal visual pathways share a similar posterior-to-anterior gradient in the representation of static and dynamic visual features.</p>

                <p>Opioid abuse poses a major healthcare challenge. To meet this challenge, the brain mechanisms underlying opioid abuse need to be more systematically characterized. It is commonly thought that the addictive potential of opioids stems from their ability to enhance the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Indeed, activation of mu opioid receptors (MORs) disinhibits VTA dopaminergic neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens, providing a substrate for the rewarding effects of opioids. However, the abuse potential of opioids has also been linked to their ability to suppress pain and aversive states. Although medial VTA dopaminergic neurons are commonly excited by aversive stimuli, the effects of MOR signaling on this circuitry have not been systematically explored. To fill this gap, a combination of anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches were used to study the afferent circuitry of paranigral VTA (pnVTA) dopaminergic neurons and its modulation by MOR signaling in male and female mice. These studies revealed that aversion-linked glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and lateral habenula innervated a subset of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons and that activation of presynaptic MORs suppressed their ability to drive pnVTA spiking. A distinct set of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons were innervated by lateral hypothalamus GABAergic neurons, which also were subject to MOR modulation. Thus, MORs robustly inhibit the ability of brain circuits coding aversive states to drive the activity of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that the addictive potential of opioids may stem in part from their ability to act as negative reinforcers.</p>

                <p>It remains an open question in visual neuroscience whether the recognition of written words and visual objects engages distinct neural mechanisms intrinsically, unaffected by confounding factors such as stimulus properties and task demands, and, if so, where these differences are localized. Previous studies comparing these two processes have faced challenges in simultaneously controlling stimulus properties, including low-level visual features and high-level phonological and semantic attributes, as well as task demands. Here, we addressed these issues using Chinese pictographs, visually identical stimuli that can be interpreted either as words (lexical symbols) or as objects (visual depictions) and that were rigorously matched in a visual form, phonology, and semantics. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 36 male and female human participants performed three language tasks (realness judgment, sound retrieval, and meaning judgment) on pictographs that were contextually recognized as words or objects, with each task applied to both recognition types under identical procedures. Results revealed robust word&ndash;object differences in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and their associated networks. Compared with object recognition, word recognition elicited stronger activation in the IPL and reduced deactivation in the ACC. Furthermore, both regions exhibited distinct multivoxel activation patterns between the word and object recognition and showed stronger functional connectivity with other brain regions specifically during word recognition. This study provides well-controlled evidence for intrinsic neural dissociations between word and object recognition, highlighting a parietal&ndash;cingulate network as a core substrate differentiating these processes.</p>

                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is primarily regulated by the brainstem pons. In particular, the sublaterodorsal tegmentum (SubLDT) in the dorsal pons contains neurons whose activity is selective to REM sleep. Elucidation of the precise identities of these neurons and their roles in REM sleep regulation is challenging, however, due to the functional and molecular heterogeneity of the SubLDT. A recent study revealed that corticotropin-releasing hormone&ndash;binding protein (<I>Crhbp</I>)-positive neurons in the SubLDT projecting to the medulla play a crucial role in REM sleep regulation and that loss of these <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons underlies sleep deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. The firing patterns of these neurons during sleep/wake, however, remained unknown. Here, we used an opto-tagging method and conducted cell-type-specific recordings from <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons using a glass pipette microelectrode in unanesthetized male mice. We recorded 58 <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons and found that many of these neurons are REM sleep-active neurons (41.4%) and that the remaining neurons are mostly either wake-active, wake/REM sleep-active, or non-REM sleep-active. In addition, projection-specific recordings revealed that the medulla-projecting <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons are mostly REM sleep-active neurons (75.0%). Based on clustering analysis and spike waveform analysis, REM sleep-active <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons can be further divided into different subtypes according to their electrophysiological properties, suggesting that <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons play diverse roles in REM sleep regulation.</p>

                <p>The removal of no-longer-relevant information from visual working memory (WM) is important for the functioning of WM, given its severe capacity limitation. Previously, with an "ABC-retrocuing" WM task, we have shown that removing information can be accomplished in different ways: by simply withdrawing attention from the newly irrelevant memory item (IMI; i.e., via "passive removal") or by "actively" removing the IMI from WM (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B33">Shan and Postle, 2022</cross-ref>). Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms behind active removal, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from human subjects (both sexes) performing the ABC-retrocuing task. Specifically, we tested the hijacked adaptation model, which posits that active removal is accomplished by a top-down-triggered down-modulation of the gain of perceptual circuits, such that sensory channels tuned to the to-be-removed information become less sensitive. Behaviorally, analyses revealed that, relative to passive removal, active removal produced a decline in the familiarity landscape centered on the IMI. Neurally, we focused on two epochs of the task, corresponding to the triggering, and to the consequence, of active removal. With regard to triggering, we observed a stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling wave for active versus passive removal. With regard to the consequence(s) of removal, the response to a task-irrelevant "ping" was reduced for active removal, as assessed with ERP, suggesting that active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the IMI.</p>

                <p>Recent fMRI studies reported transformed representations between perception and visual working memory (VWM) in the human early visual cortex (EVC). This is inconsistent with the still widely cited original proposal of the sensory account of VWM, which argues for a shared perception-VWM representation based on successful cross-decoding of the two representations. Although cross-decoding was usually lower than within-VWM decoding and consistent with transformed VWM representations, this has been attributed to experimental differences between perceptual and VWM tasks: once they are equated, the same representation is expected to exist in both. Including human participants of both sexes, this study compared target and distractor representations during the same VWM delay period for the same objects, thereby equating experimental differences. Even with strong VWM representations present throughout the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC, including EVC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), fMRI cross-decoding revealed significant representational differences between distractors (perception) and targets (VWM) in both regions. Similar differences existed between target encoding (perception) and delay (VWM), being greater in OTC than PPC, indicating more invariant target representations in PPC than OTC. As only part of the sensory input is usually task-relevant, sustaining sensory input in VWM without selection/refinement/consolidation is both taxing and unnecessary. Transformed representations, mediated by task goals and associative areas coding task-relevant information (e.g., PPC), can easily account for these and other recent findings. A task-driven transformed account of VWM thus better captures the nature of VWM representation in the human brain (including EVC) than the sensory representations originally proposed by the sensory account of VWM.</p>

                <p>Humans exhibit laterality preferences, with handedness being the most extensively studied. Accordingly, brain&ndash;handedness associations are well documented. However, laterality preferences extend beyond handedness to include other limbs, such as footedness and eyedness. Despite these distinctions, brain&ndash;footedness and brain&ndash;eyedness associations using resting-state functional connectomes remain largely unexplored. We utilize two large datasets, the Human Connectome Project-Development (HCP-D) and Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-A), to study the associations between sidedness (i.e., handedness, footedness, and eyedness) and whole-brain functional connectomes. While hand and foot preferences were correlated significantly, they explained &lt;40% of the variance, suggesting some distinctions between measures. For both cohorts, significant associations between handedness connectivity were observed [<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, network-based statistics (NBS) corrected]. Notable patterns include increased connectivity for left-handedness in the posterior temporal areas and right-handedness in cerebellar regions. In contrast, significant associations between footedness and handedness connectivity were observed only in the HCP-A (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, NBS corrected) and not the HCP-D. No significant associations between eyedness and connectivity were observed for either group. Finally, we compared the effect size between brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations. A greater difference was found in the HCP-D. The two cohorts primarily differed in edge distribution in the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. Overall, in adults, brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations were similar. However, in children to adolescents, brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations diverge, suggesting a developmental shift. Characterizing sidedness associations with whole-brain connectomes may provide important insights into understanding the motor and visual systems, rehabilitation and occupational therapy, and benchmarking normative variations in the connectome.</p>

                Background Phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, glycosides and volatile oils are only a few bioactive phytochemicals found in most plants including Catha edulis Forsk which is consumed daily in most regions of Uganda. Objective This study aimed to analyze and quantify the bioactive constituents in lyophilized leaf extract of Catha edulis (‘Kasenge’ variety) from central Uganda. Methods Total alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic and saponins contents were determined using spectrophotometric techniques. The bioactive compounds in the Catha edulis leaves were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Result The total alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids and saponins contents were 0.0063 mg/g atropine equivalent, 0.099 mg/g gallic acid equivalent, 0.047 mg/g quercetin equivalent and saponins 0.69 mg/g diosgenin equivalent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting detected thirty-four characteristic phytochemical peaks while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified twenty-one bioactive compounds including essential fatty acids and diterpenoids known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties with 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester (Z, Z, Z) constituting 35.01%, hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester and methyl ester accounting for over 21% of the composition, phytol (10.38%), butyl 9,12-octadecadienoate (7.58%) and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol (3.22%). Conclusion Although the alkaloid content in the Kasenge khat variety was lower than that reported in khat from other regions, the phenolic and flavonoid concentrations were comparable, suggesting the potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits of this variety. Further research is recommended to explore its pharmacological properties and optimize cultivation practices to enhance the yield of bioactive compound.

                Background Infertility is a global health issue, with male factor infertility contributing to nearly 50% of cases. Dysregulation of Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT1) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling impairs spermatogenesis. Bioactive compounds offer promising alternatives for targeting these pathways. Brassica oleracea var. viridis (collard greens) contains phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting potential reproductive benefits. Objective This study evaluates bioactive compounds from B. oleracea var. viridis as AKT1 and EGFR inhibitors through molecular docking and in vivo validation in a cimetidine (Cemet ®)-induced reproductive toxicity model. Methods Bioactive compounds were identified via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and analyzed for physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties. Molecular docking assessed binding affinity to AKT1 and EGFR, followed by in vivo validation in cimetidine-exposed Wistar rats. Effects of ethanol extracts and solvent fractions on sperm motility, viability, morphology, count, and agglutination were examined. Results Gamma-sitosterol showed the strongest binding affinity to AKT1 (-8.0 kcal/mol) and EGFR (-6.5 kcal/mol), comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Computational analysis indicated high Gastro-intestinal absorption and low toxicity for most compounds. In vivo, B. oleracea extracts significantly improved sperm motility, viability, and count, mitigating cimetidine-induced toxicity. Ethanol Leaf Extract of Brassica Oleracea (ELEBO), AFBO (Aqueous fractions of brassica Oleracea) and BFBO (n- Butanol fractions of brassica Oleracea) fractions had the most pronounced protective effects, reducing sperm abnormalities and agglutination. Conclusion B. oleracea var. viridis bioactive compounds show spermatoprotective effects, likely via AKT1 and EGFR inhibition. These findings support further research into B. oleracea derivatives for male reproductive health applications.

                Choosing a course of study in a Senior High School in Ghana is a major problem for both students and parents due to the limited number of Courses Offered. Irrespective of a student’s career aspiration, the current policies of the Ministry of Education, the Ghana Education Service, and the West Africa Examinations Council is restricted to seven main courses, namely: Agriculture, Business, Technical, Home Economics, Visual Arts, General Arts, and General Science. These courses do not reflect the numerous educational courses and career options of the world of work. Although there are schools that offers specialized programmes but the student numbers are few. Annually, hundreds of thousands of students graduate only to be confronted with another hurdle of choosing a course for further studies different from the course studied earlier, or pursue a career different from the course studied in the Senior High School. To address these challenges, this paper recommends Common Career Selective Programme, as a course of study to represent Core subjects, which consists of 18 selective courses dubbed CCSP-18. The CCSP-18 provides general course descriptions, options for specified courses, elective courses, career options, career requirements, and a list of associated careers. The CCSP-18 concept is designed to offer students variety of course options, that suite individual natural abilities and future career goals, in line with Education-for-All by the year 2030. The CCSP-18 policy brief provides policy outcomes and implications, plus actionable recommendations for education reform, and curriculum development. To improve learning outcomes for quality and efficiency, and make education relevant and accessible to all pre-tertiary students. In conclusion education reform using CCSP-18 provide options for Core Courses Offered, and career guidance to students, with basic educational knowledge to drive development agenda, and promote quality Education-for-All in Ghana, across the West Africa sub-region, Africa and other countries globally.

                <p>by Lin Wang, Ting Wang, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Xiao-Fen Lin, Jia Li, Jin-Bao Liao, Rui-Wu Wang</p>

Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-196/v2?src=rss">Fostering sustainable business values: The impact of universities on shaping sustainable entrepreneurial intentions in higher education students from developing economies [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the influence of universities, sustainable business values, and key antecedents of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students in Indian higher education institutions. Employing a cross-sectional design, data were gathered through a structured questionnaire administered to students enrolled in entrepreneurship education programs. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore path relationships and test the hypothesized model. The findings indicate that entrepreneurial attitudes, subjective norms, and sustainable business values significantly predict students’ sustainable entrepreneurial intentions. The study underscores the pivotal role of entrepreneurship education in shaping students’ experiential learning, entrepreneurial attitudes, and sustainable orientation. These insights emphasize the need for integrating comprehensive, sustainability-focused content into entrepreneurship curricula to equip future entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges. The practical implications of this research are twofold. First, it provides universities and policymakers with actionable insights to design and implement more effective and sustainability-centered entrepreneurship programs. Second, by fostering sustainable entrepreneurial mindsets, the study contributes to the promotion of responsible business practices and the stimulation of new venture creation, thereby supporting broader economic development goals in emerging economies. This research highlights that embedding sustainability in entrepreneurship education is not only timely but also essential for nurturing socially responsible and innovation-driven entrepreneurs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-678/v1?src=rss">The Theory of Observational Relativity Serial Report 1: A New Theory with Significant Discoveries [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Einstein’s theory of relativity has been around for over 100 years. However, we still cannot understand why the speed of light is invariant, why spacetime is curved, and why photons have no rest mass. Methods Based on the dialectical materialist view of nature, the author believes that photons, like other particles of matter, should have the rest mass of their own. Therefore, the author sets up an axiom system based on the first principle of time definition, attempting to deduce a new spacetime transformation, and further, derive the mass-speed relation that can endow photons with rest mass. Results Unexpectedly, the author’s logical deduction led to the formation and establishment of a new theory in physics: Observational Relativity (OR). The theory of OR has uncovered the root and essence of the relativistic effects of matter motion and matter interactions presented in spacetime: all relativistic effects are observational effects and apparent phenomena -- the speed of light is not really invariant; spacetime is not really curved; and the rest mass of photons is not really zero. Conclusions The theory of OR discovers that the Galilean transformation and Newtonian mechanics are the product of the idealized observation agent OA∞; the Lorentz transformation and Einstein relativity theory are the product of the optical observation agent OA(c). The theory of OR is a theory of the general observation agent OA(η) (0<η<∞; η→∞), which has generalized and unified Newtonian mechanics and Einstein relativity theory. This article will report the significant discoveries of OR, and at the same time, clarify that the theory of OR not only is the product of logic and theory, but also has empirical basis and empirical evidences, supported by observations and experiments. So, mankind needs to re-examine his physics and reshape his view of nature.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As neuroscience techniques become increasingly sophisticatedand accessible, their application to marine mammal research remainsunderdeveloped and fragmented. Cetacean and pinniped brains exhibit remarkableevolutionary specializations; yet systematic, reproducible data across speciesare scarce. Ethical, logistical, and methodological constraints hinder samplingand analysis of central nervous system tissues, often limiting studies to smallcohorts and reducing diagnostic accuracy in neuropathological investigations.Gaps persist in understanding neuroanatomical organization, pathogeneticmechanisms of neurodegeneration, and the effects of acoustic and environmentalstressors on brain health. Noninvasive neuroimaging methods such as post-mortemmagnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging offer promise butsuffer from incompatible protocols and limited standardization. In-vitro andmolecular techniques including cellular reprogramming may provide new avenuesfor translational research if harmonized approaches are adopted. We identify a criticalneed for coordinated efforts to standardize best practice protocols for the sampling, storage and systematic analyses of marine mammal nervous tissues. To this end, we propose the formation of an inclusive, multidisciplinary network and invitecollaboration through our <a href="https://osf.io/e6zg2/?view_only=3ce751a651f245d2a374c6c7dba59e0a">Open Science Framework project</a>. By aligning methodologies and broadeninginternational partnerships, we aim to transform marine mammal neuroscience intoa robust contributor to comparative neurobiology and environmental healthmonitoring. This is a call to action to collectively grow this emerging field.</p>

                Pregnancy involves physiological adaptations that optimize fetal development. Reduced maternal core temperature may protect offspring from the teratogenic effects of excess heat, but the mechanisms regulating body temperature during pregnancy remained largely unclear. In a recent study in mice, Ladyman and colleagues identified the prolactin receptor (Prlr) as a thermal switch lowering maternal core temperature and promoting offspring survival in warm environments.

                In this issue of Neuron, Cai et al. demonstrated that transferring fecal microbiota from fibromyalgia patients to mice confers pain hypersensitivity and depression-like behavior, which is reversed by fecal microbiota transplant from healthy donors. Fibromyalgia patients experience significant symptom relief after fecal microbiota transplantation.

                Gamma oscillations are ubiquitous in visual processing. But what do they really represent? In this issue of Neuron, Meyerolbersleben et al. show that well-defined oscillatory bursts in the mouse visual cortex reflect the processing of distinct features of natural scenes.

                Rescue-like prosocial behaviors are critical for the survival and well-being of social species. Yet, the neural circuits underlying these behaviors remain poorly understood. Recently, four independent research groups discovered rescue-like behaviors in mice—where individuals assist an unresponsive conspecific—and identified the key neural mechanisms involved.

                Nahiyera et al. uncover the distinct Sca1pos neutrophils enriched in murine liver under steady-state condition, which increase during pathological conditions. Characterization reveals these cells as a mature, pro-inflammatory subpopulation with enhanced effector functions. Pharmacological intervention attenuates their activity and reduces inflammatory outcomes.

                Newson et al. show that antibiotics not only reduce Salmonella infection but also disrupt the gut microbiota, enabling relapse and transmission from tissue-lodged persister reservoirs. Relapse requires intracellular virulence factors and produces clonal populations. Microbiota transfer between hosts blocks pathogen relapse-associated blooms, revealing how the host-pathogen-microbiota axis shapes transmission.

                Using transcriptomics and reverse genetics, Phan-Canh et al. present a comprehensive analysis of genes governing phenotypic White-Brown switching in the multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen Candida auris. White and Brown morphotypes exhibit distinct stress responses and virulence traits, linked to complex gene regulatory networks that govern the phenotypic plasticity during fungal infections.

                Pollak Fiyaksel et al. describe YjbH, a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein in Bacillus subtilis, conserved among gram-positive bacteria. YjbH binds the incoming phage genome, confines phage production to a specific subcellular site, and promotes cell divisions, often asymmetrical, to exclude the infected compartment, and limit viral spread.

                Inhibition enables cortical stability, yet which classes of interneurons contribute to stabilization across conditions is not known. Cammarata et al. reveal that somatostatin interneurons in mouse V1 are selectively required for network stability during high input and arousal. Thus, the cortex inhabits multiple different stabilization regimes.

                Nucleic acid replication is a central process at the origin of life. On early Earth, replication is challenged by the dilution of molecular building blocks and the difficulty of separating daughter from parent strands, a necessity for exponential replication. While thermal gradient systems have been shown to address these problems, elevated temperatures lead to degradation. Also, compared to constant temperature environments, such systems are rare. The isothermal system studied here models an abundant geological environment of the prebiotic Earth, in which water is continuously evaporated at the point of contact with the gas flows, inducing up-concentration and circular flow patterns at the gas-water interface through momentum transfer. We show experimentally that this setting drives a 30-fold accumulation of nucleic acids and their periodic separation by a threefold reduction in salt and product concentration. Fluid dynamic simulations agree with observations from tracking fluorescent beads. In this isothermal system, we were able to drive exponential DNA replication with Taq polymerase. The results provide a model for a ubiquitous non-equilibrium system to host early Darwinian molecular evolution at constant temperature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99368">A temporally restricted function of the dopamine receptor Dop1R2 during memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is a crucial neuromodulator involved in many brain processes, including learning and the formation of memories. Dopamine acts through multiple receptors and controls an intricate signaling network to regulate different tasks. While the diverse functions of dopamine are intensely studied, the interplay and role of the distinct dopamine receptors to regulate different processes is less well understood. An interesting candidate is the dopamine receptor Dop1R2 (also known as Damb), as it could connect to different downstream pathways. Dop1R2 is reported to be involved in forgetting and memory maintenance; however, the circuits requiring the receptors are unknown. To study Dop1R2 and its role in specific spatial and temporal contexts, we generated a conditional knockout line using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Two FRT sites were inserted, allowing flippase-mediated excision of the dopamine receptor in neurons of interest. To study the function of Dop1R2, we knocked it out conditionally in the mushroom body of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, a well-studied brain region for memory formation. We show that Dop1R2 is required for later memory forms but not for short-term aversive or appetitive memories. Moreover, Dop1R2 is specifically required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe but not in the γ-lobe of the mushroom body. Our findings show a spatially and temporally restricted role of Dop1R2 in the process of memory formation, highlighting the differential requirement of receptors during distinct phases of learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100947">Molecular characterization of gustatory second-order neurons reveals integrative mechanisms of gustatory and metabolic information</a></h4>

              
                Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In <i>Drosophila</i>, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of <i>Drosophila</i>, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with <i>trans-</i>Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly’s metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95058">Fast evolution of SOS-independent multi-drug resistance in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                The killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of DNA damage, either directly or indirectly, which activates the SOS response. RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, has been shown to play a central role in the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, even after short-term exposure. While this paradigm is well established for DNA-damaging antibiotics, it remains unclear whether β-lactams elicit similar resistance dynamics or depend on RecA and SOS-mediated mechanisms. In this study, we observed a rapid and stable evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold MIC increase within 8 hr) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> lacking RecA after a single exposure to ampicillin. Contrary to expectation, this resistance emerged through an SOS-independent mechanism involving two distinct evolutionary forces: increased mutational supply and antibiotic-driven selection. Specifically, we found that RecA deletion impaired DNA repair and downregulated base excision repair pathways, while concurrently repressing the transcription of antioxidative defence genes. This dual impairment led to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn promoted the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations. While ampicillin treatment did not alter survival, it selectively enriched for rare mutants arising in the RecA-deficient and ROS-elevated background. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that this oxidative environment, together with compromised DNA repair capacity, increases genetic instability and creates a selective landscape favouring the expansion of resistant clones. These results highlight the repair-redox axis as a key determinant of bacterial evolvability under antimicrobial stress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105153">CRISPR-edited DPSCs constitutively expressing BDNF enhance dentin regeneration in injured teeth</a></h4>

              
                Dental caries, a prevalent global health issue, results from complex bacterial interactions. In response to harmful stimuli, a desirable outcome for the tooth is the formation of tertiary dentin, a protective reparative process that generates new hard tissue. This reparative dentinogenesis is associated with significant inflammation, which triggers the recruitment and differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Previously, we have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), key mediators of neural functions, are activated during the DPSC-mediated dentin regeneration process. In this study, we further define the role of inflammation in this process and apply stem cell engineering to enhance dentin regeneration in injured teeth. Our data show that TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs rapidly increase during odontogenic differentiation, further amplified by inflammatory inducers and mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lymphotoxin-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide. An in vivo dentin formation assessment was conducted using a mouse pulp-capping/caries model, where Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-engineered DPSCs overexpressing BDNF were transplanted into inflamed pulp tissue. This transplantation significantly enhanced dentin regeneration in injured teeth. To further explore potential downstream pathways, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of TNFα-treated DPSCs, both with and without TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin-B. The results revealed significant changes in gene expression related to immune response, cytokine signaling, and extracellular matrix interactions. Taken together, our study advances our understanding of the role of BDNF in dental tissue engineering using DPSCs and identifies potential therapeutic avenues for improving dental tissue repair and regeneration strategies.

">Nonsense-mediated decay masks cryptic splicing events caused by TDP-43 loss</a></h4>

              
                In frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is lost from the nucleus, leading to cryptic exon inclusion events in dozens of neuronal genes. Here, we show that many cryptic splicing events have been missed by standard RNA-sequencing analyses because they are substrates for nonsense-mediated decay. By inhibiting nonsense-mediated decay in neurons we unmask hundreds of novel cryptic splicing events caused by TDP-43 depletion, providing a new picture to TDP-43 loss of function in neurons.

">Investigating Age-Related Decline in Sensorimotor Control Using Robotic Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Background: Aging is linked to widespread changes in sensorimotor control, leading to functional decline, mobility limitations, and an increased risk of falls. Certain aspects of the neurological examination and assessment of the motor system are subjective, underscoring the need for objective and quantitative tools to evaluate sensorimotor performance. Methods: To address this, we designed three experimental tasks using the vBOT planar robotic manipulandum to compare sensorimotor performance in healthy young adults (<35 years) and older adults (>60 years). Unlike previous assessments, our tasks uniquely integrate simultaneous bimanual control and altered dynamic conditions to comprehensively assess sensorimotor capabilities. The first task involved a bimanual de novo motor learning paradigm in which participants coordinated both hands to control a virtual 2D arm and performed 400 center-out and out-to-center trials. The second task assessed unimanual control using the right hand to perform center-out movements to eight targets. It introduced dynamic forces simulating object manipulation during the final 200 trials. The third task was similar but applied a viscous force field in the last 200 trials. It also included a scoring mechanism rewarding brisk movements, thereby encouraging participants to perform closer to their maximum capabilities. In this task, performance was also compared between the dominant and non-dominant arms. Group comparisons and within-subject differences were evaluated using appropriate statistical analyses. Results: Each task effectively identified age-related differences, but the viscous resistance task proved particularly sensitive, capturing significant age-related declines in force generation and movement duration. This scoring approach likely amplified performance differences, highlighting its suitability for detecting subtle effects of aging. Older adults generally showed slower movement, longer task completion times, reduced peak forces, and prolonged reaction times. However, individual performance varied, with some older participants performing on par with younger individuals. In the third experiment, the dominant arm showed consistently better performance than the non-dominant arm, underscoring the sensitivity of the metrics to lateralized differences in motor control. Conclusions: These findings suggest that robot-based tasks have potential to quantify age-related differences in sensorimotor control and may support more precise clinical assessments.

">An online dynamic experimental framework to study single neuron responses in humans</a></h4>

              
                Single-neuron activity can be recorded from patients being evaluated for neurosurgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy who volunteer to have microwires implanted for single cell research that aims to study various aspects of the human brain. These recordings provide an unprecedented window into the human brain to observe how information is encoded and retrieved at the cellular level. Current single cell research paradigms require laborious offline analysis to identify stimuli eliciting neuronal responses and introduce new relevant stimuli in a follow up task. Any delays due to patient availability can compromise the follow up task, risking loss of experimental progress as recording electrodes may move away from previously recorded neurons. This paper introduces a novel experimental framework for online single cell data analysis and dynamic sampling of the stimulus space. It allows for real-time data acquisition and analysis to identify response-eliciting stimuli, introduce new relevant stimuli, and discard those that fail to elicit responses.

                <p>Mazes are a fundamental and widespread tool in behavior and systems neuroscience research in rodents, especially in spatial navigation and spatial memory investigations in <I>ad libitum</I> behaving animals. However, their form and inflexibility often restrict potential experimental paradigms that involve multiple or adaptive maze designs. Unique layouts often lead to elevated costs, whether financially or in terms of time investment from scientists. To alleviate these issues, we have developed an automated, modular maze system that is flexible and scalable. This open-source Adapt-A-Maze (AAM) system will allow for experiments with multiple track configurations in rapid succession. Additionally, the flexibility can expedite prototyping of behavioral paradigms. Automation ensures less variability in experimental parameters and higher throughput. Finally, the standardized componentry enhances experimental repeatability within labs and replicability across labs. Our maze was successfully used across labs, in multiple experimental designs, with and without extracellular or optical recordings, in rats. The AAM system presents multiple advantages over current maze options and can facilitate novel behavior and systems neuroscience research.</p>

                <p>Our ability to shift from one emotion to the next allows us to adapt our behaviors to a constantly changing and often uncertain environment. Although previous studies have identified cortical and subcortical regions involved in affective responding, none have shown how these regions track and represent transitions between different emotional states, nor how such responses are modulated based on the recent emotional context. To study this, we commissioned new musical pieces designed to systematically move participants (<I>N</I> = 39, 20 males and 19 females) through different emotional states during fMRI and to manipulate the emotional context in which different participants heard a musical motif. Using a combination of data-driven (hidden Markov modeling) and hypothesis-driven methods, we confirmed that spatiotemporal patterns of activation along the temporoparietal axis reflect transitions between music-evoked emotions. We found that the spatial and temporal signatures of these neural response patterns, as well as self-reported emotion ratings, were sensitive to the emotional context in which the music was heard. In particular, brain-state transitions associated with emotional changes occurred earlier in time when the preceding affective state was of a similar valence to the current affective state. The findings argue that emotional changes are an essential signal by which the temporoparietal lobe segments our continuous experiences, and further clarify its role in linking changes in external auditory signals with our dynamic and contextually dependent emotional responses.</p>

                Background Periodontitis is a multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Proinflammatory markers such as IL-8, PGE2, and CRP play key roles in its pathogenesis and are also elevated in systemic conditions like COVID-19. Shared inflammatory pathways and increased ACE2 expression suggest a potential link between periodontitis and COVID-19. However, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on periodontal health remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, CRP, and clinical periodontal parameters in individuals with and without a history of COVID-19. Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 47 participants from RSKGM FKG UI and Bhayangkara Hospital TK.I.R. Said Sukanto. Clinical parameters assessed included bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected to analyze ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, and CRP levels. Participants were grouped based on COVID-19 history, with strict inclusion criteria and statistical analysis using G*Power, SPSS, and GraphPad Prism. Results ACE2, CRP, and IL-8 levels were significantly higher in individuals with a history of COVID-19 (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.006, respectively), while PGE2 showed a non-significant trend (p = 0.065). No significant differences were observed in BOP, PPD, and CAL between groups. CRP levels were significantly elevated in both periodontitis and non-periodontitis groups with a COVID-19 history. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between ACE2 and other biomarkers (IL-8, PGE2, CRP), as well as between IL-8 and clinical parameters (PPD, CAL). Conclusion This study indicates a correlation between elevated levels of ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, and CRP and the severity of periodontitis in individuals with a history of COVID-19. These findings emphasize the necessity for further research and periodontal care for patients with COVID-19 history.

                Psychoactive substances alter perception, mood, cognition, or consciousness and include a wide range of compounds such as alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, and khat. Substance use among college and university students is associated with significant health issues, academic struggles, and premature death. This scoping review examines digital health interventions, including mobile and internet platforms, targeting substance use reduction among college students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A comprehensive search across databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar identified 11 eligible studies conducted across seven countries between 2013 and 2025. These studies focused primarily on alcohol use and included digital health tools like instant messaging, Telegram applications, text messaging, and web-based interventions. The results suggest that digital health technologies can effectively motivate college students in LMICs to reduce or abstain from psychoactive substance use. However, there is a notable research gap in evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of these tools, especially mobile text messaging, which remains one of the most widely used methods in LMICs. The review highlights the need for further research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to better understand the impact of digital health interventions on substance use reduction and to develop evidence-based programs for behavior change.

                Background Migration is a social determinant of health, and migrants often face health inequalities compared to host populations. Migrants are underrepresented in health research in many European countries, including Belgium, which is concerning. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a comprehensive framework aimed at guiding research on migration and health within the WHO European Region. This study supports evidence-based policymaking among European member states by providing a foundational structure for examining various strategies and methodologies. The framework serves as a catalyst for discussion and critical analysis, contributing to the formulation of a global research agenda on migration and health under WHO’s leadership. Additionally, it outlines key research priorities and offers strategic recommendations to enhance the understanding and response to health issues related to migration. One of these recommendations calls on researchers to “maximise the use of existing data from research and routinely collected data in health information systems”. Objective The overarching aim of our study is to map available sources of datasets about access to and use of medicines among migrant populations, and test if and under which conditions they can be used in research, by taking the case of Flanders, Belgium. Methods This study will involve conducting a focused review to map datasets used for reporting access to and use of medicines among migrants, followed by a qualitative study with key informants; a structured analysis of ethical and legal challenges to be addressed when using the datasets we identified for research; and content description and evaluation of the different identified datasets. Results We assert that the results of our study will help presenting the diverse sources of data about medicines access or use among migrant populations. They will be also used to provide recommendations about enhancing the possibilities of retrieving, and using data, including recommendations for (legal, ethical, methodological) risk mitigation for retrieving and using these data.

                Background Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae is a promising alternative source for animal feed due to their ability to convert organic waste into high-quality biomass rich in essential amino acids and beneficial fatty acids. However, the post-harvest processing method is crucial affecting nutritional value. This study evaluated the effects of five processing methods (air-drying, sun-drying, oven-drying, microwave-drying, and roasting) on the amino acid and fatty acid profiles of BSF larvae reared on rice bran, milk waste, and slaughterhouse waste combined substrate. Methods BSF larvae were reared for seven days on a combined substrate consisting of rice bran, milk waste, and slaughterhouse waste. After harvesting, the larvae underwent five different drying treatments until a constant weight was achieved. The dried larvae were ground into powder and analyzed for amino acid and fatty acid profiles. Results BSF larvae meal contained substantial amounts of essential amino acids, particularly lysine (1.76–2.41%), leucine (1.46–2.11%), and valine (1.41–1.77%). Fatty acid profiles of BSF larvae meal were predominantly composed of lauric acid (22.07–24.88%), palmitoleic acid (22.84–27.89%), and linolelaidic acid (20.95–23.86%). Microwave drying retained the highest levels of essential amino acids and fatty acids. Oven drying provided balanced retention, while roasting effectively preserved key fatty acids but posed a risk of amino acid degradation. Sun drying and air-drying maintained monounsaturated fatty acids and key amino acids, offering a cost-effective alternative despite the prolonged drying period. Conclusions Microwave drying is the most effective method for preserving the nutritional quality of BSF larvae meal, but other methods offer practical advantages depending on resource availability and processing goals. Future research should explore hybrid drying techniques, optimization of processing conditions, and long-term stability assessments to enhance the efficiency and applicability of BSF larvae meal as a sustainable feed ingredient.

                Background Performance monitoring is essential for enhancing academic staff productivity and institutional accountability in higher education. In Uganda, private chartered universities face challenges in implementing effective performance monitoring systems. This study examines the types and effectiveness of these systems in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 386 academic staff using structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 10 academic deans from four selected universities. Ethical approval was obtained from institutional review boards and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS3145ES). Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative responses. Results Findings indicate that various performance monitoring tools are in use, including student evaluations, peer reviews, and supervisory assessments. However, their application is often inconsistent, with limited feedback loops and weak integration into staff development initiatives. Quantitative analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between effective performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that performance monitoring accounted for 21.3% of the variance in staff performance. Conclusions While performance monitoring tools are present in private chartered universities in Western Uganda, their inconsistent implementation undermines their effectiveness. Strengthening the integration of monitoring outcomes into professional development and decision-making processes could enhance academic staff performance. These findings underscore the need for systematic policy enforcement and capacity-building in performance management practices within the sector.

                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease caused by a primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. This case report describes a rare transmission of chickenpox potentially linked to an indirect route via surface contamination rather than direct person-to-person contact. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus, lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient’s face, neck, and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body, and the rest of the body, except the legs, hands, genital areas, and buttocks, was also highly infected. Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons. The patient showed marked improvement within a week and fully recovered without complications or post-herpetic sequelae. This case emphasizes the importance of strict infection control and hygiene protocols in preventing rare indirect transmission of the VZV, particularly in healthcare settings.

Development and association with symptoms of depression and anxiety. [version 2; peer review: 1 approve</a></h4>

              
                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The proposed 20-item questionnaire captures six important aspects of social media use, and it may serve as a meaningful tool for assessing the potential association between social media use and mental health and related outcomes.

                <p>by Shuanglin Jing, Hao Wang</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic and related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) significantly alter the transmission dynamics of non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases, with respiratory infections such as influenza being disproportionately affected. We aim to compare influenza’s epidemiological characteristics between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods to inform public health responses. We develop two influenza transmission models incorporating age structure and multi-strain dynamics, featuring time-varying transmission and mortality rates. Using publicly available U.S. data, we calibrate these models to evaluate age- and strain-specific transmission patterns and mortality rates across different pandemic eras. Our analysis reveals that during the final pandemic year, influenza transmission among adults (≥18 years) initially declined but rebounded to pre-pandemic levels within the first post-pandemic year following NPI relaxation and behavioral normalization, while transmission stability persists in the <18 cohort. All-age influenza mortality rates exhibit a transient elevation during the pandemic’s final year before returning to baseline levels pre-pandemic. Furthermore, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmission rate of influenza A decreases alongside peaks in new cases, while the transmission of influenza B fluctuates without a decline. Our findings indicate that while the COVID-19 pandemic has induced significant transient modifications in influenza’s epidemiological profile, key transmission and mortality characteristics regain pre-pandemic equilibrium within one year following pandemic resolution.

Open Educational Resources (OER) offer a transformative approach to education by providing freely accessible learning materials. However, creating OER that meet the FAIR principles—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—while navigating the complexities of copyright law presents unique challenges. This paper serves as a practical guide for educators and institutions wishing to develop and share FAIR-compliant OER while respecting intellectual property rights. It presents 10 quick tips that guide the process of developing legally secure FAIR OER from planning to creation to publication, including considerations for AI-generated materials. These quick tips cover critical aspects such as understanding licensing options, cataloguing resources to ensure comprehensive attribution, and effectively managing copyright concerns. By following these guidelines, educators can improve the discoverability and reusability of their materials, streamline the creation process, and contribute to a more open and collaborative educational landscape. This comprehensive approach not only supports the widespread dissemination of knowledge but also empowers educators to innovate and share resources effectively, fostering a global community of open science and education practice, while adhering legal regulations.

                <p>by Cassandra E. Benkwitt, Anna Zora, Ameer Ebrahim, Rodney Govinden, Ines D. Lange, Sean Evans, Melissa Schulze, Emma Cotton, Lucie Bennett, Nicholas A. J. Graham</p>

Cross-ecosystem nutrient fluxes can influence recipient food webs, including both static measures of structure and dynamic measures of function. However, a mechanistic basis for how nutrient subsidies affect both structure and function across multiple trophic levels is still lacking. Here, we investigate how nutrient subsidies provided by seabirds influence coral reefs, focusing on the link between primary producers and primary consumers. We quantified turf algal cover and herbivorous fish biomass (static metrics of structure), as well as productivity of turf algae and herbivorous fish (dynamic metrics of function) at sites in the inner Seychelles with a range of seabird densities due to different rat invasion histories. Turf algae grew faster with increasing amounts of seabird-derived nutrients. These higher rates of primary productivity, in turn, fueled higher productivity and biomass of herbivorous fishes. In contrast, seabird-derived nutrients did not increase cover of turf algae nor did turf algal cover affect herbivores. Instead, seabird nutrients indirectly enhanced herbivorous fish productivity and biomass via effects on primary productivity, which, in turn, led to increased top-down control by herbivores to limit turf algal cover. Overall, dynamic metrics better revealed the flow and effects of seabird-derived nutrients through coral-reef food chains and revealed the mechanisms by which seabirds can enhance coral-reef ecosystem function. These findings could be used to predict the benefits of removing introduced rats from islands, which can increase seabird populations and restore nutrient connectivity, thus potentially enhancing ecosystem function across multiple trophic levels on coral reefs.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70023?af=R">Resting‐State Functional Connectivity With the Anterior and Posterior Hippocampus: An Analysis of fMRI Data From the Human Connectome Project</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The anterior and posterior hippocampus exhibit distinct patterns of connectivity and are consequently hypothesized to have distinct functions. While there is evidence that the posterior hippocampus interacts with the default network and the anterior hippocampus interacts with the attention network during memory processes, there are conflicting hypotheses regarding connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions during rest. If hippocampal connectivity during rest parallels connectivity during memory, we would expect the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus to have preferential connectivity with the attention network and the default network, respectively. Alternatively, given the association between the hippocampus and the default network, both regions of the hippocampus may have similar levels of connectivity with the default network. We used data from the Human Connectome Project (with 864 participants) to investigate resting-state functional connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus and evaluated the degree of overlap between these patterns of connectivity and the attention network and default network. In direct opposition to the connectivity pattern during memory, resting-state data revealed preferential connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and the default network and between the posterior hippocampus and the attention network. These findings indicate that connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus may differ between rest and active memory processing. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, during rest, the specific connectivity patterns supporting memory are less engaged. This does not imply an overall suppression of hippocampal connectivity but rather a relative reduction in engagement with the attention and default networks compared to task-based memory states. Such a shift may facilitate more dynamic network reconfiguration during memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Valproic acid (VPA), a first-line antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing drug, has been linked to congenital malformations, cognitive disabilities, and an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when used during pregnancy. ASD is a lifelong developmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive deficits, with a higher prevalence in males. Growing evidence highlights that hippocampal circuits, particularly CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions, are crucial for cognitive and social functions often impaired in ASD. Notably, VPA exposure at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) coincides with critical neurodevelopmental processes in the hippocampus, making it highly susceptible to oxidative damage and structural disruptions. Using a mouse model of ASD induced by a single prenatal VPA injection (400 mg/kg) at E12.5, this study assessed morphological and oxidative changes in the hippocampus. Male and female offspring were evaluated for core behavioral and cognitive alterations of ASD. After the behavioral tests, their brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and antioxidant enzyme dosage. The results showed that prenatal exposure to VPA indeed induces ASD-like behaviors, including reduced sociability, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired working memory. Sholl analysis showed increased dendritic branching in granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons of VPA male mice, while VPA female mice exhibited hypoarborization in dentate gyrus granule cells. Both male and female VPA mice displayed higher dendritic spine density. Concurrently, oxidative stress was increased in the hippocampi of the VPA mice, as evidenced by alterations in oxidative stress biomarkers. Our work underscores gender differences in the effects of prenatal VPA exposure and points to a possible role for hippocampal neuron morphology and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ASD.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons linked to spatial navigation and toroidal dynamics in the mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) show unexpected minute-scale (&lt; 0.01 Hz) oscillatory sequences without neural organization or clear relation to behavior. However, the conditions sustaining these’ ultraslow' equences remain uncertain. Since dopaminergic modulation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) enables infraslow (&lt; 0.1 Hz) oscillations in sparse neural networks (SNN), we hypothesize that SNN might sustain minute-scale (ultraslow) oscillatory sequences when bypassing the modulation. Using computational simulations through detailed numerical investigations, the conditions that enable the MEC-like ultraslow rhythms are characterized in an Izhikevich's SNN with dopaminergic STDP modulation. To induce the ultraslow sequences, a few active neurons are defined at each simulation step following a toroid-like trajectory. The results indicate that even when disrupting the dopamine-based STDP learning, the ultraslow oscillations require a second-scale resetting of the membrane potential to keep the sequential firing. Interestingly, separate oscillations on synapses that do not contribute to the firing rate at a specific time step (silent synaptic connections) are observed in the presence of the sequences. Since the mechanisms underlying the experimental finding are unknown, the present manuscript generates hypotheses on the conditions that sustain minute-scale sequences, which will be relevant for the community studying population dynamics in the MEC.</p>

<p>Schematic overview of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) repair strategies highlighting the transition from autografts, allografts, and xenografts to decellularized tissues and natural/synthetic polymer-based nerve conduits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Regenerative medicine aims to restore damaged tissues or organs using stem cells, biomaterials, and decellularized grafts. Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI), affecting 2.8% of patients, lead to severe functional impairments with global socioeconomic costs exceeding $7 billion annually. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, full functional recovery remains elusive, particularly in critical gap injuries (&gt; 3 cm). Autografts remain the gold standard but are hindered by donor tissue scarcity and complications like neuroma formation. Allografts face challenges due to the lack of Schwann cells and neurotrophic support. Emerging approaches in tissue engineering leverage synthetic materials, such as polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA), and biological scaffolds like decellularized nerve grafts. These innovations provide structural support, promote axonal regeneration, and retain extracellular matrix components, enabling cell adhesion and migration while minimizing antigenicity. However, barriers such as mechanical instability, scar tissue formation, and inadequate cellularization persist. This review explores the anatomy and clinical significance of the sciatic nerve, historical perspectives on peripheral nerve repair, and current treatment strategies. It evaluates biological and synthetic nerve conduits, highlighting FDA-approved products and their advantages in promoting nerve regeneration. Additionally, the paper discusses challenges in the field, including limited functional recovery and the need for more effective clinical solutions. By combining natural and synthetic materials with growth factor delivery and vascularization strategies, engineered scaffolds hold promise for improving outcomes in PNI repair. Further research is essential to optimize these technologies and bridge existing gaps in clinical practice.</p>

                Xu et al. show that mouse hepatocellular carcinomas arising spontaneously or due to exposure to various carcinogens share mutational signatures with human cancers and that the majority of environmental carcinogens act as tumor promoters by exacerbating endogenous mutational processes. They also show that some genotoxic carcinogens exhibit a dose-dependent threshold effect.

                Neuromuscular diseases can affect slow- and fast-twitch myofibers differently. Dos Santos et al. found that myofiber denervation represses the expression of fast-twitch genes and the transcription factor Maf. In both mouse and human muscles, Maf counteracts muscle atrophy by activating fast-twitch genes and repressing atrophy-associated genes.

                TBK1 is well established as a key regulator of antiviral immunity, while its role in antifungal defense remains elusive. Feng et al. reveal that upon Candida albicans stimulation, TBK1 translocates to the phagosome in an SRC-dependent manner, where it undergoes phosphorylation and forms a positive feedback loop with SRC, thereby amplifying antifungal immune responses.

                Prasanphanich et al. demonstrate that granulysin-high decidual natural killer cells (dNKs) of rhesus macaques and humans share conserved signatures of antimicrobial defense and immunoregulation. Moreover, granulysin-high dNKs respond to inflammation and infection by increasing cytotoxic, cytokine, and inflammatory signatures, further defining GNLY-high dNKs as important immune effectors providing placental immunity.
