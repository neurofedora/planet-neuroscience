              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordination chemogenetics for activation of GPCR-type glutamate receptors in brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Direct activation of cell-surface receptors is highly desirable for elucidating the physiological roles of receptors. However, subtype-selective ligands are very limited because of the high homology among receptor subtypes. A potential approach for selective activation of a receptor subtype is chemogenetics, in which both point mutagenesis of the receptors and designed ligands are used. However, ligand-binding properties are affected in most current methods. Here, we developed a chemogenetic method for direct activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), which plays essential roles in cerebellar functions in the brain. Our screening identified a mGlu1 mutant, mGlu1(N264H), that was directly activated by palladium complexes. Notably, a palladium complex showing low cytotoxicity successfully activated mGlu1 in mGlu1(N264H) knock-in mice, revealing that activation of endogenous mGlu1 is sufficient to evoke the critical cellular mechanism of synaptic plasticity, a basis of motor learning in the cerebellum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An internal expectation guides Drosophila egg-laying decisions</a></h4>

              
                When presented with two egg-laying substrates, Drosophila lay most of their eggs on the option with higher relative value. How do flies make this relative-value decision? Might the strategy they use allow them to choose the best option even when they experience substrates with a more complex spatiotemporal profile than in canonical two-choice paradigms? We measured Drosophila egg-laying behavior in diverse substrate environments. In all cases, we found that flies dynamically increase or decrease their egg-laying rates as they explore substrates for a deposition site so as to target eggs to the best, recently visited option. Visiting the best option typically led to a strong reduction in egg laying on other substrates for several minutes, with this timescale varying across fly strains. Our data support a model in which flies compare the value of the current substrate with an internally constructed expectation on the value of available options to regulate the likelihood of laying an egg. We show that dopamine-neuron activity is critical for learning and/or expressing this expectation, similar to its role in certain tasks in vertebrates. Integrating sensory experiences over minutes to generate an internal sense of the quality of available options, i.e., forming an expectation, allows flies to use a dynamic reference point for judging the current substrate and might be a general way in which decisions are made, even beyond flies and egg laying.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Capillary stall quantification from optical coherence tomography angiogram maximum intensity projections</a></h4>

              
                Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is applicable to the study of cerebral microvasculature in vivo. Optimised acquisition schemes enable the generation of three-dimensional OCT angiograms, i.e., volumetric images of red blood cell flux in capillary networks, currently at a repetition rate of up to 1/10 seconds. This makes testable a new class of hypotheses that strive to bridge the gap between microscopic phenomena occurring at the spatial scale of neurons, and less invasive but crude techniques to measure macroscopic blood flow dynamics. Here we present a method for quantifying the occurrence of transient capillary stalls in OCT angiograms, i.e., events during which blood flow through a capillary branch is temporarily occluded. By making the assumption that information on such events is present predominantly in the imaging plane, we implemented a pipeline that automatically segments a network of interconnected capillaries from the maximum intensity projections (MIP) of a series of 3D angiograms. We then developed tools enabling rapid manual assessment of the binary flow status (open/stalled) of hundreds of capillary segments based on the intensity profile of each segment across time. The entire pipeline is optimized to run on a standard laptop computer, requiring no high-performance, low-availability resources, despite very large data volumes. To further reduce the threshold of adoption, and ultimately to support the development of reproducible research methods in the young field, we provide the documented code for scrutiny and re-use under a permissive open-source license.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The generalized spatial representation in the prefrontal cortex is inherited from the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal and neocortical neural activity is modulated by the position of the individual in space. While hippocampal neurons provide the basis for a spatial map, prefrontal cortical neurons generalize over environmental features. Whether these generalized representations result from a bidirectional interaction with, or are mainly derived from hippocampal spatial representations is not known. By examining simultaneously recorded hippocampal and medial prefrontal neurons, we observed that prefrontal spatial representations show a delayed coherence with hippocampal ones. We also identified subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that formed functional cross-area couplings; these resembled the optimal connections predicted by a probabilistic model of spatial information transfer and generalization. Moreover, cross-area couplings were strongest and had the shortest delay preceding spatial decision-making. Our results suggest that generalized spatial coding in the medial prefrontal cortex is inherited from spatial representations in the hippocampus, and that the routing of information can change dynamically with behavioral demands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Separable actions of acetylcholine and noradrenaline on neuronal ensemble formation in hippocampal CA3 circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Y. Prince, Travis Bacon, Rachel Humphries, Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova, Claudia Clopath, Jack R. Mellor</p>

In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are separately proposed as saliency signals that dictate memory encoding but it is not known if they represent distinct signals with separate mechanisms. Here, we show experimentally that acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent noradrenaline, suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance excitatory–inhibitory ratio in the mossy fiber pathway but CA3 recurrent network properties are only altered by acetylcholine. We explore the implications of these findings on CA3 ensemble formation using a hierarchy of models. In reconstructions of CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber pathway disinhibition facilitates postsynaptic dendritic depolarization known to be required for synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. We further show in a spiking neural network model of CA3 how acetylcholine-specific network alterations can drive rapid overlapping ensemble formation. Thus, through these distinct sets of mechanisms, acetylcholine and noradrenaline facilitate the formation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 that encode salient episodic memories in the hippocampus but acetylcholine selectively enhances the density of memory storage.

                <p>by Chaitanya S. Gokhale, Stefano Giaimo, Philippe Remigi</p>

Correct decision making is fundamental for all living organisms to thrive under environmental changes. The patterns of environmental variation and the quality of available information define the most favourable strategy among multiple options, from randomly adopting a phenotypic state to sensing and reacting to environmental cues. Cellular memory—the ability to track and condition the time to switch to a different phenotypic state—can help withstand environmental fluctuations. How does memory manifest itself in unicellular organisms? We describe the population-wide consequences of phenotypic memory in microbes through a combination of deterministic modelling and stochastic simulations. Moving beyond binary switching models, our work highlights the need to consider a broader range of switching behaviours when describing microbial adaptive strategies. We show that memory in individual cells generates patterns at the population level coherent with overshoots and non-exponential lag times distributions experimentally observed in phenotypically heterogeneous populations. We emphasise the implications of our work in understanding antibiotic tolerance and, in general, bacterial survival under fluctuating environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between parallel encoding motor plans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vince Enachescu, Paul Schrater, Stefan Schaal, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Living in an uncertain world, nearly all of our decisions are made with some degree of uncertainty about the consequences of actions selected. Although a significant progress has been made in understanding how the sensorimotor system incorporates uncertainty into the decision-making process, the preponderance of studies focus on tasks in which selection and action are two separate processes. First people select among alternative options and then initiate an action to implement the choice. However, we often make decisions during ongoing actions in which the value and availability of the alternatives can change with time and previous actions. The current study aims to decipher how the brain deals with uncertainty in decisions that evolve while acting. To address this question, we trained individuals to perform rapid reaching movements towards two potential targets, where the true target location was revealed only after the movement initiation. We found that reaction time and initial approach direction are correlated, where initial movements towards intermediate locations have longer reaction times than movements that aim directly to the target locations. Interestingly, the association between reaction time and approach direction was independent of the target probability. By modeling the task within a recently proposed neurodynamical framework, we showed that action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between motor plans that are encoded in parallel.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypothesis on the pathophysiology of syringomyelia based on analysis of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging of Chiari-I malformation patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite a number of hypotheses, our understanding of the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still limited. The current prevailing hypothesis assumes that the piston-like movement of the cerebellar tonsils drives the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the syrinx through the spinal perivascular space. However, it still needs to be verified by further experimental data. A major unexplained problem is how CSF enters and remains in the syrinx that has a higher pressure than the subarachnoid space. Methods: I analyzed phase-contrast MRI scans of 18 patients with Chiari-I malformation with syringomyelia undergoing foramen magnum decompression and 21 healthy volunteers. I analyzed the velocity waveforms of the CSF and the brain in various locations. The obtained velocity waveforms were post-processed using a technique called synchronization in situ. I compared between the preoperative data and the control data (case-control study), as well as between the preoperative and postoperative data (cohort study). Results: The syrinx shrank in 17 (94%) patients with good clinical improvement. In Chiari-I patients, the velocity of the tonsil was significantly larger than controls, but was significantly smaller than that of the CSF in the subarachnoid space, suggesting passive rather than active movement. The abnormal tonsillar movement disappeared after surgery, but the velocity waveform of the spinal subarachnoid CSF did not change. These results, contradicting the above mentioned hypothesis, required an alternative explanation. I thus hypothesized that there is a CSF channel between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx. This channel assumes one-way valve function when mildly compressed by the cyclical movement of the cerebellar tonsil. The decompression of the tonsils switches off the one-way valve, collapsing the syrinx. Conclusions: My hypothesis reasonably explained my data that clearly contradicted the existing hypothesis, and successfully addressed the above-mentioned theoretical problem. It will serve as a working hypothesis for further study of syringomyelia pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐term cognitive outcome in anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of NMDAR encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive functions, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, as well as subjective complaints, depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in more than 80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in 2/3 of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median mRS=1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time-dependent with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, while improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as outcome measure in future clinical studies.</p>

                <p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (<i>LTA4H</i>) polymorphisms in Zambian adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and its association with mortality. We completed genotype testing on 101 definite cases of TBM and 119 consecutive non-TBM controls. The distribution of genotypes among TBM patients was as follows: C/C (0.83), C/T (0.14), T/T (0.03). There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between TBM and non-TBM patients. We found no relationship between <i>LTA4H</i> polymorphism and survival. Prospective studies are needed to determine the benefit of adjuvant steroids in TBM based upon population LTA4H genotype.</p>

The healthcare industry has witnessed heightened interest from universities in capitalizing on the discoveries made by faculty to create intellectual property, form new companies and seek investments. However, academic investigators and even Biotechnology start-ups may be unfamiliar with how industry sources and evaluates these opportunities. In this Comment, we share the approaches and principles by which a large healthcare company sources innovation and assesses opportunities to serve as a guide to better deal making with the goal of improving health for humanity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">microRNA-mediated regulation of microRNA machinery controls cell fate decisions</a></h4>

              
                microRNAs associate with Argonaute proteins, forming the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), to repress target gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although microRNAs are critical regulators in mammalian cell differentiation, our understanding of how microRNA machinery, such as the miRISC, are regulated during development is still limited. We previously showed that repressing the production of one Argonaute protein, Ago2, by Trim71 is important for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) self-renewal (Liu et al., 2021). Here we show that among the four Argonaute proteins in mammals, Ago2 is the major developmentally regulated Argonaute protein in mESCs. Moreover, in pluripotency, besides the Trim71-mediated regulation of <i>Ago2</i> (Liu<i> et al.</i>, 2021), <i>Mir182/Mir183</i> also repress <i>Ago2</i>. Specific inhibition of this microRNA-mediated repression results in stemness defects and accelerated differentiation through the let-7 microRNA pathway. These results reveal a microRNA-mediated regulatory circuit on microRNA machinery that is critical to maintaining pluripotency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HIF1α stabilization in hypoxia is not oxidant-initiated</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxic adaptation mediated by HIF transcription factors requires mitochondria, which have been implicated in regulating HIF1α stability in hypoxia by distinct models that involve consuming oxygen or alternatively converting oxygen into the second messenger peroxide. Here, we use a ratiometric, peroxide reporter, HyPer to evaluate the role of peroxide in regulating HIF1α stability. We show that antioxidant enzymes are neither homeostatically induced nor are peroxide levels increased in hypoxia. Additionally, forced expression of diverse antioxidant enzymes, all of which diminish peroxide, had disparate effects on HIF1α protein stability. Moreover, decrease in lipid peroxides by glutathione peroxidase-4 or superoxide by mitochondrial SOD, failed to influence HIF1α protein stability. These data show that mitochondrial, cytosolic or lipid ROS were not necessary for HIF1α stability, and favor a model where mitochondria contribute to hypoxic adaptation as oxygen consumers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proof of concept for multiple nerve transfers to a single target muscle</a></h4>

              
                Surgical nerve transfers are used to efficiently treat peripheral nerve injuries, neuromas, phantom limb pain or improve bionic prosthetic control. Commonly, one donor nerve is transferred to one target muscle. However, the transfer of multiple nerves onto a single target muscle may increase the number of muscle signals for myoelectric prosthetic control and facilitate the treatment of multiple neuromas. Currently, no experimental models are available for multiple nerve transfers to a common target muscle in the upper extremity. This study describes a novel experimental model to investigate the neurophysiological effects of peripheral double nerve transfers. For this purpose, we developed a forelimb model to enable tension-free transfer of one or two donor nerves in the upper extremity. Anatomic dissections were performed to design the double nerve transfer model (n=8). In 62 male Sprague-Dawley rats the ulnar nerve of the antebrachium alone (n=30) or together with the anterior interosseus nerve (n=32) was transferred to reinnervate the long head of the biceps brachii. Before neurotization, the motor branch to the biceps’ long head was transected at the motor entry point and resected up to its original branch to prevent auto-reinnervation. In all animals, coaptation of both nerves to the motor entry point could be performed tension-free. Mean duration of the procedure was 49 ± 13 min for the single nerve transfer and 78 ± 20 min for the double nerve transfer. Twelve weeks after surgery, muscle response to neurotomy, behavioral testing, retrograde labeling and structural analyses were performed to assess reinnervation. These analyses indicated that all nerves successfully reinnervated the target muscle. No aberrant reinnervation was observed by the originally innervating nerve. Our observations suggest a minimal burden for the animal with no signs of functional deficit in daily activities or auto-mutilation in both procedures. Furthermore, standard neurophysiological analyses for nerve and muscle regeneration were applicable. This newly developed nerve transfer model allows for the reliable and standardized investigation of neural and functional changes following the transfer of multiple donor nerves to one target muscle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bazooka/Par3 cooperates with Sanpodo for the assembly of Notch clusters following asymmetric division of Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                In multiple cell lineages, Delta-Notch signalling regulates cell fate decisions owing to unidirectional signalling between daughter cells. In <i>Drosophila</i> pupal sensory organ lineage, Notch regulates the intra-lineage pIIa/pIIb fate decision at cytokinesis. Notch and Delta that localise apically and basally at the pIIa-pIIb interface are expressed at low levels and their residence time at the plasma membrane is in the order of minutes. How Delta can effectively interact with Notch to trigger signalling from a large plasma membrane area remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the signalling interface possesses a unique apicobasal polarity with Par3/Bazooka localising in the form of nano-clusters at the apical and basal level. Notch is preferentially targeted to the pIIa-pIIb interface, where it co-clusters with Bazooka and its cofactor Sanpodo. Clusters whose assembly relies on Bazooka and Sanpodo activities are also positive for Neuralized, the E3 ligase required for Delta-activity. We propose that the nano-clusters act as snap buttons at the new pIIa-pIIb interface to allow efficient intra-lineage signalling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics and variability in the pleiotropic effects of adaptation in laboratory budding yeast populations</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is driven by the accumulation of mutations which can have a range of unrealized pleiotropic effects in other environments. These pleiotropic consequences of adaptation can influence the emergence of specialists or generalists, and are critical for evolution in temporally or spatially fluctuating environments. While many experiments have examined the pleiotropic effects of adaptation at a snapshot in time, very few have observed the dynamics by which these effects emerge and evolve. Here, we propagated hundreds of diploid and haploid laboratory budding yeast populations in each of three environments, and then assayed their fitness in multiple environments over 1000 generations of evolution. We find that replicate populations evolved in the same condition share common patterns of pleiotropic effects across other environments, which emerge within the first several hundred generations of evolution. However, we also find dynamic and environment-specific variability within these trends: variability in pleiotropic effects tends to increase over time, with the extent of variability depending on the evolution environment. These results suggest shifting and overlapping contributions of chance and contingency to the pleiotropic effects of adaptation, which could influence evolutionary trajectories in complex environments that fluctuate across space and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small, correlated changes in synaptic connectivity may facilitate rapid motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Animals can rapidly adapt their movements to external perturbations. This adaptation is paralleled by changes in single neuron activity in the motor cortices. Behavioural and neural recording studies suggest that when animals learn to counteract a visuomotor perturbation, these changes originate from altered inputs to the motor cortices rather than from changes in local connectivity, as neural covariance is largely preserved during adaptation. Since measuring synaptic changes in vivo remains very challenging, we used a modular recurrent network model to compare the expected neural activity changes following learning through altered inputs (Hinput) and learning through local connectivity changes (Hlocal). Learning under Hinput produced small changes in neural activity and largely preserved the neural covariance, in good agreement with neural recordings in monkeys. Surprisingly given the presumed dependence of stable neural covariance on preserved circuit connectivity, Hlocal led to only slightly larger changes in neural activity and covariance compared to Hinput. This similarity is due to Hlocal only requiring small, correlated connectivity changes to counteract the perturbation, which provided the network with significant robustness against simulated synaptic noise. Simulations of tasks that impose increasingly larger behavioural changes revealed a growing difference between Hinput and Hlocal, which could be exploited when designing future experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Approach to Measuring Protein Turnover in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Organoids by Mass Spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Patient-derived organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a model for studying human diseases beyond conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Briefly, these three-dimensional organoids are highly complex, capable of self-organizing, recapitulate cellular architecture, and have the potential to model diseases in complex organs, such as the brain. For example, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease - proteostatic dysfunction leading to the selective death of neurons in the substantia nigra - present a subtle distinction in cell type specificity that is simply lost in 2D cell culture models. As such, the development of robust methods to study global proteostasis and protein turnover in organoids will remain a critical need as organoid models evolve. To solve this problem, we have designed a workflow to extract proteins from organoids and measure global protein turnover using mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This allowed us to measure the turnover rates of 844 proteins and compare protein turnover to previously reported data in primary cell cultures and in vivo models. Taken together, this method will facilitate the study of proteostasis in organoid models of human disease and will provide an analytical and statistical framework to measure protein turnover in organoids of all cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical sensorimotor activity in the execution and suppression of discrete and rhythmic movements</a></h4>

              
                Although the engagement of sensorimotor cortices in movement is well documented, the func-tional relevance of brain activity patterns remains ambiguous. Especially, the cortical engage-ment specific to the pre-, within-, and post-movement periods is poorly understood. The pre-sent study addressed this issue by examining sensorimotor EEG activity during the perfor-mance as well as STOP-signal cued suppression of movements pertaining to two distinct clas-ses, namely, discrete vs. ongoing rhythmic movements. Our findings indicate that the lateral-ized readiness potential (LRP), which is classically used as a marker of pre-movement pro-cessing, indexes multiple pre- and in- movement-related brain dynamics in a movement-class dependent fashion. In- and post-movement event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) ob-served in the Mu (8-13 Hz) and Beta (15-30 Hz) frequency ranges were associated with esti-mated brain sources in both motor and somatosensory cortical areas. Notwithstanding, Beta ERS occurred earlier following cancelled than actually performed movements. In contrast, Mu power did not vary. Whereas Beta power may reflect the evaluation of the sensory predicted outcome, Mu power might engage in linking perception to action. Additionally, the rhythmic movement forced stop (only) showed a post-movement Mu/Beta rebound, which might re-flect an active "clearing-out" of the motor plan and its feedback-based online control. Overall, the present study supports the notion that sensorimotor EEG modulations are key markers to investigate control or executive processes, here initiation and inhibition, which are exerted when performing distinct movement classes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular structure and conformation of stereocilia tip-links elucidated by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory transduction (MT), the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, underpins hearing and balance and is carried out within hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells harbor actin-filled stereocilia, arranged in rows of descending heights, where the tips of stereocilia are connected to their taller neighbors by a filament composed of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), deemed the "tip-link". Tension exerted on the tip-link opens an ion channel at the tip of the shorter stereocilia, thus converting mechanical force into an electrical signal. While biochemical and structural studies have provided insights into the molecular composition and structure of isolated portions of the tip-link, the architecture, location and conformational states of intact tip-links, on stereocilia, remains unknown. Here we report in situ cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the tip-link in mouse stereocilia. We observe individual PCDH15 molecules at the tip and shaft of stereocilia and determine their stoichiometry, conformational heterogeneity, and their complexes with CDH23. The PCDH15/CDH23 complexes occur in clusters, frequently with more than one copy of PCDH15 at the tip of stereocilia, suggesting that tip-links might consist of more than one copy of the PCDH15/CDH23 heterotetramer and by extension, might include multiple MT complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Biophysical Counting Mechanism for Keeping Time</a></h4>

              
                The ability to estimate and produce appropriately timed responses is central to many behaviors including speaking, dancing, and playing a musical instrument. A classical framework for estimating or producing a time interval is the pacemaker-accumulator model in which pulses of a pacemaker are counted and compared to a stored representation. However, the neural mechanisms for how these pulses are counted remains an open question. The presence of noise and stochasticity further complicate the picture. We present a biophysical model of how to keep count of a pacemaker in the presence of various forms of stochasticity using a system of bistable Wilson-Cowan units asymmetrically connected in a one-dimensional array; all units receive the same input pulses from a central clock but only one unit is active at any point in time. With each pulse from the clock, the position of the activated unit changes thereby encoding the total number of pulses emitted by the clock. This neural architecture maps the counting problem into the spatial domain, which in turn translates count to a time estimate. We further extend the model to a hierarchical structure to be able to robustly achieve higher counts.

                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) controls psychomotor activity and is an efficient therapeutic deep brain stimulation target in Parkinson's disease patients. Despite evidence indicating position-dependent therapeutic effects and distinct functions within the STN, input circuit and cellular profile in the STN remain largely unclear. Using advanced neuroanatomical techniques, we constructed a comprehensive connectivity map of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in both the mouse and human STN. Our detailed circuit- and cellular-level connectivity revealed a topographically graded organization with three convergent types of indirect and hyperdirect-pathways. Furthermore, we identified two functional types of glutamatergic STN neurons (parvalbumin, PV +/- neurons) segregated with a topographical distribution. Glutamatergic PV+ STN neurons contribute to burst firing. We confirmed synaptic connectivity from indirect and hyperdirect pathways to both PV+ and PV-. These data suggest a complex interplay of information integration within the basal ganglia underlying coordinated movement control and therapeutic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharyngeal timing and particle transport defects in Caenorhabditis elegans feeding mutants</a></h4>

              
                The nematode C. elegans uses rhythmic muscle contractions and relaxations called pumps to filter, transport, and crush food particles. A number of feeding mutants have been identified, including those with slow pharyngeal pumping rate, weak muscle contraction, defective muscle relaxation, and defective grinding of bacteria. Many aspects of these pharyngeal behavioral defects and how they affect pharyngeal function are not well understood. For example, the behavioral deficits underlying inefficient particle transport in 'slippery' mutants have been unclear. Here we use high speed video microscopy to describe pharyngeal pumping behaviors and particle transport in wild-type animals and in feeding mutants. Different 'slippery' mutants exhibit distinct defects including weak isthmus contraction, failure to trap particles in the anterior isthmus, and abnormal timing of contraction and relaxation in pharyngeal compartments. Our results show that multiple deficits in pharyngeal timing or contraction can cause defects in particle transport.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional characterisation of single nucleotide variants of the psychiatric risk gene cacna1c in the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Several genome-wide association studies have associated CACNA1C variants with psychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Taking advantage of the zebrafish larva as a model, we investigated how two different mutations in cacna1c; sa10930 (nonsense mutation) and sa15296 (splice site mutation), affect neuronal function. We characterized changes in cacna1c mRNA, neurotransmitter levels and behaviour, as well as whole-brain activity using single electrode local field potential recordings. Both point mutations resulted in a significant reduction in cacna1c mRNA, as well as social behaviour and prepulse inhibition deficits. Whereas sa15296 mutants displayed abnormal locomotor and open-field behaviour, we observed normal behaviour in the sa10930 mutants. Brain recordings from both mutants had lower spectral power while sa15296 displayed significant seizure-like activity. Finally, sa10930 homozygotes showed increased dopamine and serotonin levels, decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and unchanged glutamate levels while homozygous sa15296 larvae showed increased levels of serotonin and glutamate, and unaffected levels of GABA and dopamine. Our work provides new insights into the functional role of CACNA1C in behavioural, electrophysiological and biochemical traits linked to psychiatric disorders. We show a functional role for the non-coding mutation (sa15296) in the cacna1c in vivo animal model. Consistent with existing hypotheses, our data suggest that disruption of gene expression, neurotransmission, and cortical excitability are involved in CACNA1C related mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representation of motion concepts in occipitotemporal cortex: fMRI activation, decoding and connectivity analyses</a></h4>

              
                Embodied theories of semantic cognition predict that brain regions involved in motion perception are engaged when people comprehend motion concepts expressed in language. Left lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) is implicated in both motion perception and motion concept processing but prior studies have produced mixed findings regarding which parts of this region are engaged by motion language. We scanned participants performing semantic judgements about sentences describing motion events and static events. We performed univariate analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses to investigate the effect of motion on activity and connectivity in different parts of LOTC. In multivariate analyses that decoded whether a sentence described motion or not, the whole of LOTC showed above-chance level performance, with performance exceeding that of other brain regions. Univariate ROI analyses found that the middle part of LOTC was more active for motion events than static ones. Finally, PPI analyses found that when processing motion events, the middle and posterior parts of LOTC, overlapping with motion perception regions, increased their connectivity with cognitive control regions. Taken together, these results indicate that the whole of the LOTC responds differently to motion vs. static event descriptions, and that these effects are most pronounced in more posterior sites. These findings are consistent with embodiment accounts of semantic processing, and suggest that understanding verbal descriptions of motion engages areas of the occipitotemporal cortex involved in perceiving motion.

                Thalamic nucleus reuniens (NRe) is located on the midline and acts as a hub to mediate interactions between hippocampal, entorhinal and prefrontal areas although these connections are poorly defined at the cellular and synaptic level. Using electrophysiology and monosynaptic circuit-tracing, we found that pyramidal cells in CA1 receive no direct input from NRe. This contrasts starkly with prefrontal cortex, subiculum and entorhinal cortex, and indicates that NRe inputs to CA1 primarily drive local inhibition and not excitation they do in the other regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cx43 carboxyl terminal domain determines AQP4 and Cx30 endfoot organization and blood brain barrier permeability</a></h4>

              
                The neurovascular unit (NVU) consists of cells intrinsic to the vessel wall, the endothelial cells and pericytes, and astrocyte endfeet that surround the vessel but are separated from it by basement membrane. Endothelial cells are primarily responsible for creating and maintaining blood-brain-barrier (BBB) tightness, but astrocytes contribute to the barrier through paracrine signaling to the endothelial cells and by forming the glia limitans. Gap junctions (GJs) between astrocyte endfeet are composed of connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx30, which form plaques between cells. GJ plaques formed of Cx43 do not diffuse laterally in the plasma membrane and thus potentially provide stable organizational features to the endfoot domain, whereas GJ plaques formed of other connexins and of Cx43 lacking a large portion of its cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus are quite mobile. In order to examine the organizational features that immobile GJs impose on the endfoot, we have used super-resolution confocal microscopy to map number and sizes of GJ plaques and aquaporin (AQP)-4 channel clusters in the perivascular endfeet of mice in which astrocyte GJs (Cx30, Cx43) were deleted or the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 was truncated. To determine if blood-brain-barrier integrity was compromised in these transgenic mice, we conducted perfusion studies under elevated hydrostatic pressure using horseradish peroxide as a molecular probe enabling detection of micro-hemorrhages in brain sections. These studies revealed that microhemorrhages were more numerous in mice lacking Cx43 or its carboxyl terminus. In perivascular domains of cerebral vessels, we found that density of Cx43 GJs was higher in the truncation mutant, while GJ size was smaller. Density of perivascular particles formed by AQP4 and its extended isoform AQP4ex was inversely related to the presence of full length Cx43, whereas the ratio of sizes of the particles of the AQP4ex isoform to total AQP4 was directly related to the presence of full length Cx43. Confocal analysis showed that Cx43 and Cx30 were substantially colocalized in astrocyte domains near vasculature of truncation mutant mice. These results showing altered distribution of some astrocyte nexus components (AQP4 and Cx30) in Cx43 null mice and in a truncation mutant, together with leakier cerebral vasculature, support the hypothesis that localization and mobility of gap junction proteins and their binding partners influences organization of astrocyte endfeet which in turn impacts BBB integrity of the NVU.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivariate pattern analysis reveals location specific aftereffects of 10Hz motor cortex transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may induce frequency-specific aftereffects on brain oscillations in the stimulated location, which could serve as evidence for region-specific neuroplasticity. Aftereffects of tACS on the motor system remain unknown. Objective: To find evidence for aftereffects in short EEG segments following tACS to two critical nodes of the motor network, namely, left motor cortex (lMC) and right cerebellum (rCB). We hypothesized that aftereffects of lMC will be stronger in and around lMC compared to both active stimulation of rCB, as well as inactive (sham) control conditions. Methods: To this end, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and trained a classifier to distinguish between EEG signals following each of the three stimulation protocols. This method accounts for the multitude facets of the EEG signal and thus is more sensitive to subtle modulation of the EEG signal. Results: EEG signals in both theta ({theta}, 4-8Hz) and alpha (, 8-13Hz) were better classified to lMC-tACS compared to rCB-tACS/sham, in and around lMC-tACS stimulation locations (electrodes FC3 and CP3). This effect was associated with a decrease in power following tACS. Source reconstruction revealed significant differences in premotor cortex but not in primary motor cortex as the computational model suggested. Correlation between classification accuracies in {theta} and  in lMC-tACS was stronger compared to rCB-tACS/sham, suggesting cross-frequency effects of tACS. Nonetheless, {theta}/ phase-coupling did not differ between stimulation protocols. Conclusions: Successful classification of EEG signals to left motor cortex using MVPA revealed focal tACS aftereffects on the motor cortex, indicative of region-specific neuroplasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A morphometric double dissociation: cortical thickness is more related to aging; surface area is more related to cognition</a></h4>

              
                The thickness and surface area of cortex are genetically distinct aspects of brain structure, and may be affected differently by age. However, their potential to differentially predict age and cognitive abilities has been largely overlooked, likely because they are typically aggregated into the commonly used measure of volume. In a large sample of healthy adults (N=647, aged 18-88), we investigated the brain-age and brain-cognition relationships of thickness, surface area, and volume, plus five additional morphological shape metrics. Cortical thickness was the metric most strongly associated with age cross-sectionally, as well as exhibiting the steepest longitudinal change over time (subsample N=261, aged 25-84). In contrast, surface area was the best single predictor of age-residualized cognitive abilities (fluid intelligence), and changes in surface area were most strongly associated with cognitive change over time. These findings were replicated in an independent dataset (N=1345, aged 18-93). Our results suggest that cortical thickness and surface area make complementary contributions the age-brain-cognition triangle, and highlight the importance of considering these volumetric components separately.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metacognition and the effect of incentive motivation in two compulsive disorders: gambling disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                Compulsivity is a common phenotype amongst various psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and gambling disorder (GD). Deficiencies in metacognition, such as the inability to properly estimates ones' own performance via well-calibrated confidence judgments could contribute to pathological decision-making in these psychiatric disorders. Earlier research has indeed suggested that OCD and GD patients reside at opposite ends of the confidence spectrum, with OCD patients exhibiting underconfidence, and GD patients exhibiting overconfidence. Recently, several studies established that motivational states (e.g. monetary incentives) influence metacognition, with gain (respectively loss) prospects increasing (respectively decreasing) confidence judgments. Here, we reasoned that the OCD and GD symptomatology might correspond to an exacerbation of this interaction between metacognition and motivational states. We hypothesized GD's overconfidence to be exaggerated during gain prospects, while OCD's underconfidence to be worsened in loss context, which we expected to see represented in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity. We tested those hypotheses in a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design. Our initial analyses showed increased confidence levels for GD versus OCD patients, that could partly be explained by sex and IQ. Although our primary analyses did not support the hypothesized interaction between incentive motivation and groups, exploratory analyses did show increased confidence in GD patients specifically in gain context. fMRI analyses confirmed a central role for VMPFC in the processing of confidence and incentive motivation, but with no differences between the clinical samples.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spike-sorting method based on hierarchical clustering to discriminate extracellularly recorded simple spikes and complex spikes from cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells are the only output neurons and exhibit two types of discharge. Most Purkinje cell discharges are simple spikes, which are commonly appearing action potentials exhibiting a rich variety of firing patterns with a rate of up to 400 Hz. More infrequent discharges are complex spikes, which consist of a short burst of impulses accompanied by a massive increase in dendritic Ca2+ with a firing rate of around 1 Hz. The discrimination of these spikes in extracellular single-unit recordings is not always straightforward, as their waveforms vary depending on recording conditions and intrinsic fluctuations. New Method: To discriminate complex spikes from simple spikes in the extracellular single-unit data, we developed a semiautomatic spike-sorting method based on divisive hierarchical clustering. Results: Quantitative evaluation using parallel in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of Purkinje cell dendrites indicated that 96.6% of the complex spikes were detected using our spike-sorting method from extracellular single-unit recordings obtained from anesthetized mice. Comparison with Existing Method(s): No reports have conducted a quantitative evaluation of spike-sorting algorithms used for the classification of extracellular spikes recorded from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Conclusions: Our method could be expected to contribute to research in information processing in the cerebellar cortex and the development of a fully automatic spike-sorting algorithm by providing ground-truth data useful for deep learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic extracellular vesicles modulate neuronal calcium homeostasis via transglutaminase-2</a></h4>

              
                We have uncovered a novel role for astrocytes-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in controlling intraneuronal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and identified transglutaminase-2 (TG2) as a surface-cargo of astrocytes-derived EVs. Incubation of hippocampal neurons with primed astrocyte-derived EVs have led to an increase in [Ca2+]i, unlike EVs from TG2-knockout astrocytes. Exposure of neurons or brain slices to extracellular TG2 promoted a [Ca2+]i rise, which was reversible upon TG2 removal and was dependent on Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Patch-clamp and calcium imaging recordings revealed TG2-dependent neuronal membrane depolarisation and activation of inward currents, due to the opening of L-type-VOCCs and to Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) operation in the reverse mode, as indicated by VOCCs/NCX pharmacological inhibitors. A subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase was selected by comparative proteomics and identified as being functionally inhibited by extracellular TG2, implicating Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition in NCX reverse mode-switching leading to Ca2+ influx and higher basal [Ca2+]i. These data suggest that reactive astrocytes control intraneuronal [Ca2+]i through release of EVs with TG2 as responsible cargo, which could have a significant impact on synaptic activity in brain inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated Regulation of PKA by Fast and Slow Neurotransmission in the Nucleus Accumbens Controls Plasticity and Stress Responses</a></h4>

              
                Cortical glutamate and midbrain dopamine neurotransmission converge to mediate striatum-dependent behaviors, while maladaptations in striatal circuitry contribute to mental disorders. Here we uncover a molecular mechanism by which glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling integrate to regulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) via phosphorylation of the PKA regulatory subunit, RII{beta}. We find that glutamate-dependent reduction in Cdk5-dependent RII{beta} phosphorylation alters the PKA holoenzyme auto-inhibitory state to increase PKA signaling in response to dopamine. Disruption of RII{beta} phosphorylation by Cdk5, consequently, enhances cortico-ventral striatal synaptic plasticity. Acute and chronic stress in rats inversely modulates RII{beta} phosphorylation and ventral striatal infusion of a small interfering peptide that selectively targets RII{beta} regulation by Cdk5 improves behavioral response to stress. This new signaling mechanism integrating ventral striatal glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission is likely important to brain function, may contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions, and serves as a possible target for the development of novel therapeutics for stress-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A whole-brain monosynaptic input connectome to neuron classes in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Identification of the structural connections between neurons is a prerequisite to understanding brain function. We developed a pipeline to systematically map brain-wide monosynaptic inputs to specific neuronal populations using Cre-driver mouse lines and the recombinant rabies tracing system. We first improved the rabies virus tracing strategy to accurately identify starter cells and to efficiently quantify presynaptic inputs. We then mapped brain-wide presynaptic inputs to different excitatory and inhibitory neuron subclasses in the primary visual cortex and seven higher visual areas. Our results reveal quantitative target-, layer- and cell-class-specific differences in the retrograde connectomes, despite similar global input patterns to different neuronal populations in the same anatomical area. The retrograde connectivity we define is consistent with the presence of the ventral and dorsal visual information processing streams and reveals further subnetworks within the dorsal stream. The hierarchical organization of the entire visual cortex can be derived from intracortical feedforward and feedback pathways mediated by upper- and lower-layer input neurons, respectively. This study expands our knowledge of the brain-wide inputs regulating visual areas and demonstrates that our improved rabies virus tracing strategy can be used to scale up the effort in dissecting connectivity of genetically defined cell populations in the whole mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distance estimation from monocular cues in an ethological visuomotor task</a></h4>

              
                In natural contexts, sensory processing and motor output are closely coupled, which is reflected in the fact that many brain areas contain both sensory and movement signals. However, standard reductionist paradigms decouple sensory decisions from their natural motor consequences, and head-fixation prevents the natural sensory consequences of self-motion. In particular, movement through the environment provides a number of depth cues beyond stereo vision that are poorly understood. To study the integration of visual processing and motor output in a naturalistic task, we investigated distance estimation in freely moving mice. We found that mice use vision to accurately jump across a variable gap, thus directly coupling a visual computation to its corresponding ethological motor output. Monocular eyelid suture did not affect performance, thus mice can use cues that do not depend on binocular disparity and stereo vision. Under monocular conditions, mice performed more vertical head movements, consistent with the use of motion parallax cues, and optogenetic suppression of primary visual cortex impaired task performance. Together, these results show that mice can use monocular cues, relying on visual cortex, to accurately judge distance. Furthermore, this behavioral paradigm provides a foundation for studying how neural circuits convert sensory information into ethological motor output.

                Cerebral microinfarct increases the risk of dementia. But how microscopic cerebrovascular disruption affects the brain tissue in cellular-level are mostly unknown. Herein, with a longitudinal intravital imaging, we serially visualized in vivo dynamic cellular-level changes in astrocyte, pericyte and neuron as well as microvascular integrity after the induction of cerebral microinfarction for 1 month in mice. At day 2-3, it revealed a localized edema with acute astrocyte loss, neuronal death, impaired pericyte-vessel coverage and extravascular leakage indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. At day 5, edema disappeared with recovery of pericyte-vessel coverage and BBB integrity. But brain tissue continued to shrink with persisted loss of astrocyte and neuron in microinfarct until 30 days, resulting in a collagen-rich fibrous scar surrounding the microinfarct. Notably, reactive astrocytes appeared at the peri-infarct area early at day 2 and thereafter accumulated in the peri-infarct. Oral administration of a reversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor significantly decreased the astrocyte reactivity and fibrous scar formation. Our result suggests that astrocyte reactivity may be a key target to alleviate the impact of microinfarction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Natural sound characteristics explain perceptual categorization</a></h4>

              
                As we interact with our surroundings, we encounter the same or similar objects from different perspectives and are compelled to generalize. For example, we recognize dog barks as a distinct class of sound, despite the variety of individual barks. While we have some understanding of how generalization is done along a single stimulus dimension, such as frequency or color, natural stimuli are identifiable by a combination of dimensions. To understand perception, measuring the interaction across stimulus dimensions is essential. For example, when identifying a sound, does our brain focus on a specific dimension or a combination, such as its frequency and duration? Furthermore, does the relative relevance of each dimension reflect its contribution to the natural sensory environment? Using a 2-dimension discrimination task for mice we tested untrained generalization across several pairs of auditory dimensions. We uncovered a perceptual hierarchy over the tested dimensions that was dominated by the sound's spectral composition. A model tuned to the predictability inherent in natural sounds best explained the behavioral results, suggesting that the perceptual hierarchy parallels the predictive content of natural sounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sound disrupts sleep-associated brain oscillations inrodents according to its meaning</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential but poses a risk to the animal. Filtering acoustic information according to its relevance, a process generally known as sensory gating, is crucial during sleep to ensure a balance between rest and danger detection. The mechanisms of this sensory gating and its specificity are not understood. Here, we tested the effect that sounds of different meaning had on sleep-associated ongoing oscillations. We recorded EEG and EMG from mice during rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep while presenting sounds with or without behavioural relevance. We found that sound presentation per se, in the form of an unfamiliar neutral sound, elicited a weak or no change in the sleep-dependent EEG power during NREM and REM sleep. In contrast, the presentation of a sound previously conditioned in an aversive task, elicited a clear and fast decrease in the sleep-dependent EEG power during both sleep phases, suggesting a transition to lighter sleep without awakening. The observed changes generally weakened over training days and were not present in animals that failed to learn. Interestingly, the effect could be generalized to unfamiliar neutral sounds if presented following conditioned training, an effect that depended on sleep phase and sound type. The data demonstrate that sounds are differentially gated during sleep depending on their meaning and that this process is reflected in disruption of sleep-associated brain oscillations without an effect on behavioural arousal.

                Parkinson's disease is a devastating motor disorder involving the aberrant aggregation of the synaptic protein synuclein (aSyn) and degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract. We previously showed that proSAAS, a small secreted chaperone protein widely expressed in neurons within the brain, is able to block aSyn-induced dopaminergic cytotoxicity in primary nigral neuron cultures. We show here that coinjection of proSAAS-encoding lentivirus profoundly reduced the motor asymmetry caused by unilateral nigral AAV-mediated human aSyn overexpression. This positive functional outcome was accompanied by significant amelioration of the human aSyn-induced loss of both nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals, demonstrating clear proSAAS-mediated protection of the nigro-striatal tract. ProSAAS overexpression also reduced the content of human aSyn protein in both the nigra and striatum and reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in both regions. Since proSAAS is a secreted protein, we tested the possibility that proSAAS is able to block the transsynaptic spread of aSyn from the periphery to the central nervous system, increasingly recognized as a potentially significant pathological mechanism. The number of human aSyn-positive neurites in the pons and caudal midbrain of mice following administration of human aSyn-encoding AAV into the vagus nerve was considerably reduced in mice coinjected with proSAAS-encoding AAV, supporting proSAAS-mediated blockade of transsynaptic aSyn transmission. We suggest that proSAAS may represent a promising target for therapeutic development in Parkinson's disease.

                Our visual environment impacts multiple aspects of cognition including perception, attention and memory, yet most studies traditionally remove or control the external environment. As a result, we have a limited understanding of neurocognitive processes beyond the controlled lab environment. Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over perception. To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented reality (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real world. We validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised cognitive response - the face inversion effect. Participants viewed upright and inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer task, (2) walking through an indoor environment while seeing face photographs, and (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing virtual faces. We find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted compared to upright faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that cognitively relevant signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR paradigms. This was established in both an epoch-based analysis aligned to face events, and a GLM-based approach that incorporates continuous EEG signals and face perception states. Together, this research helps pave the way to exploring neurocognitive processes in real-world environments while maintaining experimental control using AR.

                Insects can detect bilateral differences in odor concentration between their two antennae, enabling them to sense odor gradients. While gradients aid navigation in simple odor environments like static ribbons, their role in navigating complex plumes remains unknown. Here, we use a virtual reality paradigm to show that Drosophila use bilateral sensing for a distinct computation: detecting the motion of odor signals. Such odor direction sensing is computationally equivalent to motion detection algorithms underlying motion detection in vision. Simulations of natural plumes reveal that odor motion contains valuable directional information absent from the airflow, which Drosophila indeed exploit when navigating natural plumes. Olfactory studies dating back a century have stressed the critical role of wind sensing for insect navigation; we reveal an entirely orthogonal direction cue used by flies in natural environments, and give theoretical arguments suggesting that this cue may be of broad use across the animal kingdom.

                Language function in the brain, once thought to be highly localized, is now appreciated as relying on a connected but distributed network. The semantic system is of particular interest in the language domain because of its hypothesized integration of information across multiple cortical regions. Previous work in healthy individuals has focused on group-level functional connectivity (FC) analyses of the semantic system, which may obscure interindividual differences driving variance in performance. These studies also overlook the contributions of white matter networks to semantic function. Here, we identified semantic network nodes with a semantic decision fMRI task in 53 typically-aging adults, characterized network organization using structural connectivity (SC), and quantified the segregation and integration of the network using FC. Hub regions were identified in left inferior frontal gyrus. The individualized semantic network was composed of three interacting modules: 1) default-mode module characterized by bilateral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions and also including right-hemisphere homotopes of language regions; 2) left frontal module extending dorsally from inferior frontal gyrus to pre-motor area; and 3) left temporoparietal module extending from temporal pole to inferior parietal lobule. FC within Module3 and integration of the entire network related to a semantic verbal fluency task, but not a matched phonological task. These results support and extend the tri-network semantic model (Xu et al., 2017) and the controlled semantic cognition model (Chiou et al., 2018) of semantic function.

	<p>Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) are the most common mental health disorders in the school-aged child population. Although harsh parenting is a key risk factor in the shaping of DBD, studies neglect the presence of siblings and differential parenting. This study aims to compare: (1) parenting style and sibling relationship in sibling dyads of clinical families, composed of a DBD child and a non-clinical sibling, with control families composed of two non-clinical siblings; (2) parenting style, sibling relationship, and emotional and behavioral problems in DBD child, non-clinical sibling, and non-clinical child of control group. Sixty-one families (composed of mother and sibling dyads), divided into clinical (n = 27) and control (n = 34) groups, completed the APQ, SRI, and CBCL questionnaires. Results indicated differential parenting in clinical families, compared to control group families, with higher negative parenting toward the DBD child than the sibling; no difference emerged in sibling relationship within sibling dyads (clinical vs. control). Finally, externalizing and internalizing problems were higher in DBD children and their siblings, compared to control, indicating DBD sibling psychopathology vulnerability. Findings suggest inclusion of siblings in the clinical assessment and rehabilitative intervention of DBD children, given that the promotion of positive parenting could improve mental health in the offspring.</p>

	<p>Carotid revascularization may lead to improved cognitive function beyond stroke prevention. This article summarizes the conclusions from available studies on the effects of carotid reperfusion procedures on cognitive function. The papers cited used different neuropsychological tests for cognitive assessment, resulting in different methodologies and the results obtained were not always convergent. However, most studies reported an improvement in neurocognitive abilities after both vascular interventions, but a more precise assessment of the specific benefits is still awaited. Clinical determinants to predict the effects of these treatments on cognitive function are still being sought, but results are not yet satisfactory. In view of these studies, carotid stenosis seems to be an independent risk factor for cognitive deterioration, and the main mechanisms responsible are embolism and cerebral hypoperfusion. The aim of this study is to order the knowledge about the effects of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and endarterectomy (CEA) on neurocognitive functions and to verify the usefulness of using these treatments.</p>

	<p>Sleep disturbances are well-recognised symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This review updates knowledge regarding the relationship between sleep during deployment, combat-related trauma, and PTSD in military personnel, from which the importance of restorative sleep results. The description of the characteristics of sleep in military forces with the considerable roles of the operational and training contexts highlights the important consequences of degraded sleep. Indeed, a lot of data suggest a dynamic link between sleep and the onset and chronicity of PTSD. We propose a reciprocal relationship model with strategies strongly recommended or already adopted by the military to promote restorative sleep before and after combat exposure. Among the alterations in a variety of sleep architecture and sleep patterns described in PTSD, the physiological hypothesis of REM sleep fragmentation in the development of PTSD symptoms may be important because REM sleep is generally associated with emotional memory. Finally, we address clinical and research perspectives that could be used to detect or restore sleep continuity before and during military deployment to possibly alleviate nightmares and insomnia related to combat exposure and PTSD occurrence and improve our understanding of sleep in PTSD.</p>

	<p> Every day, multilinguals around the world make important healthcare decisions while using a foreign language. The present study examined how the use of a native vs. non-native language shapes evaluations and decisions about preventative care. Bilinguals were randomly assigned to evaluate a series of medical scenarios in either their native or non-native language. Each scenario described potential adverse effects of a medical condition and a preventative treatment, as well as the population risk of disease- or treatment-related complications. Participants judged the perceived negativity and likelihood of experiencing adverse effects and indicated how willing they would be to accept the preventative treatment. We found that bilinguals using a foreign language perceived disease symptoms and treatment side effects to be less negative than those using their native tongue. Foreign language users were also more likely to account for the objective risks associated with medical conditions and treatments when making decisions about preventative care. We conclude that the use of a native vs. foreign language changes how people evaluate the consequences of accepting and declining preventative treatment, with potential implications for millions of providers and patients who routinely make medical choices in their non-native tongue.</p>

<p>Pupil dynamics alterations have been found in patients affected by a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism. Studies in mouse models have used pupillometry for phenotypic assessment and as a proxy for arousal. Both in mice and humans, pupillometry is noninvasive and allows for longitudinal experiments supporting temporal specificity; however, its measure requires dedicated setups. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network that performs online pupillometry in both mice and humans in a web app format. This solution dramatically simplifies the usage of the tool for the nonspecialist and nontechnical operators. Because a modern web browser is the only software requirement, this choice is of great interest given its easy deployment and setup time reduction. The tested model performances indicate that the tool is sensitive enough to detect both locomotor-induced and stimulus-evoked pupillary changes, and its output is comparable to state-of-the-art commercial devices.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spontaneous recognition memory tasks are widely used to assess cognitive function in rodents and have become commonplace in the characterization of rodent models of neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Leveraging an animal&rsquo;s innate preference for novelty, these tasks use object exploration to capture the what, where and when components of recognition memory. Choosing and optimizing objects is a key feature when designing recognition memory tasks. Although the range of objects used in these tasks varies extensively across studies, object features can bias exploration, influence task difficulty and alter brain circuit recruitment. Here, we discuss the advantages of using 3D-printed objects in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks. We provide strategies for optimizing their design and usage, and offer a repository of tested, open-source designs for use with commonly used rodent species. The easy accessibility, low-cost, renewability and flexibility of 3D-printed open-source designs make this approach an important step toward improving rigor and reproducibility in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Secreted Reporter Assay Enables Quantitative and Longitudinal Monitoring of Neuronal Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to measure changes in neuronal activity in a quantifiable and precise manner is of fundamental importance to understand neuron development and function. Repeated monitoring of neuronal activity of the same population of neurons over several days is challenging and, typically, low-throughput. Here, we describe a new biochemical reporter assay that allows for repeated measurements of neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. We coupled activity-dependent elements from the <I>Arc/Arg3.1</I> gene with a secreted reporter, <I>Gaussia</I> luciferase (Gluc), to quantify neuronal activity without sacrificing the neurons. The reporter predominantly senses calcium and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent activity. By repeatedly measuring the accumulation of the reporter in cell media, we can profile the developmental dynamics of neuronal activity in cultured neurons from male and female mice. The assay also allows for longitudinal analysis of pharmacological treatments, thus distinguishing acute from delayed responses. Moreover, conditional expression of the reporter allows for monitoring cell type-specific changes. This simple, quantitative, cost-effective, automatable, and cell type-specific activity reporter is a valuable tool to study the development of neuronal activity in normal and disease-model conditions, and to identify small molecules or protein factors that selectively modulate the activity of a specific population of neurons.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Children born very preterm (&lt;33 weeks of gestation) are at a higher risk of developing socio-emotional difficulties compared with those born at term. In this longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that diffusion characteristics of white matter (WM) tracts implicated in socio-emotional processing assessed in the neonatal period are associated with socio-emotional development in 151 very preterm children previously enrolled into the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42). All children underwent diffusion tensor imaging at term-equivalent age and fractional anisotropy (FA) was quantified in the uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Children&rsquo;s socio-emotional development was evaluated at preschool age (median = 4.63 years). Exploratory factor analysis conducted on the outcome variables revealed a three-factor structure, with latent constructs summarized as: "emotion moderation," "social function," and "empathy." Results of linear regression analyses, adjusting for full-scale IQ and clinical and socio-demographic variables, showed an association between lower FA in the right UF and higher "emotion moderation" scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.280; <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001), which was mainly driven by negative affectivity scores (&beta; = &ndash;0.281; <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.001). Results further showed an association between higher full-scale IQ and better social functioning (&beta; = &ndash;0.334, <I>p </I>&lt;<I> </I>0.001). Girls had higher empathy scores than boys (&beta; = &ndash;0.341, <I>p </I>=<I> </I>0.006). These findings suggest that early alterations of diffusion characteristics of the UF could represent a biological substrate underlying the link between very preterm birth and emotional dysregulation in childhood and beyond.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Shifts in spatial patterns produced during the execution of a navigational task can be used to track the effects of the accumulation of knowledge and the acquisition of structured information about the environment. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of mice behavior while performing a novel goal localization task in a large, modular arena, the HexMaze. To demonstrate the effects of different forms of previous knowledge we first obtain a precise statistical characterization of animals&rsquo; paths with sub-trial resolution and over different phases of learning. The emergence of a flexible representation of the task is accompanied by a progressive improvement of performance, mediated by multiple, multiplexed time scales. We then use a generative mathematical model of the animal behavior to isolate the specific contributions to the final navigational strategy. We find that animal behavior can be accurately reproduced by the combined effect of a goal-oriented component, becoming stronger with the progression of learning, and of a random walk component, producing choices unrelated to the task and only partially weakened in time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-notification and personalisation of text messages to increase questionnaire completion in a smoking cessation pregnancy RCT: an embedded randomised factorial trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Low completion rates of questionnaires in randomised controlled trials can compromise the reliability of the results, so ways to boost questionnaire completion are often implemented. Although there is evidence to suggest that sending a text message to participants increases completion, there is little evidence around the timing or personalisation of these text messages.    Methods:  A two-by-two factorial SWAT (study within a trial) was embedded within the MiQuit-3 trial, looking at smoking cessation within pregnant smokers. Participants who reached their 36-week gestational follow-up were randomised to receive a personalised or non-personalised text message, either one week or one day prior to their follow-up. Primary outcomes were completion rate of questionnaire via telephone. Secondary outcomes included: completion rate via any method, time to completion, and number of attempts to contact required.    Results  In total 194 participants were randomised into the SWAT to receive a text message that was personalised early(n=50), personalised late (n=47), non-personalised early(n=50), or non-personalised late(n=47). There was no evidence that timing of the text message (early: one week before; or late: one day before) had an effect on any of the outcomes. There was evidence that a personalised text message would result in fewer completions compared with a non-personalised text message when data was collected only via the telephone(adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22–0.87, p=0.02). However, these results were not significant when looking at completion via any method (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30-1.24, p=0.17). There was no evidence to show that personalisation or not was better for any of the secondary outcomes.    Conclusion  Timing of the text message does not appear to influence the completion of questionnaires. Personalisation of a text message may be detrimental to questionnaire completion, if data is only collected via the telephone - however, more SWATs should be undertaken in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Heterodimer-heterotetramer formation mediates enhanced sensor activity in a biophysical model for BMP signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Shahriar Karim, Aasakiran Madamanchi, James A. Dutko, Mary C. Mullins, David M. Umulis</p>

Numerous stages of organismal development rely on the cellular interpretation of gradients of secreted morphogens including members of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family through transmembrane receptors. Early gradients of BMPs drive dorsal/ventral patterning throughout the animal kingdom in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Growing evidence in Drosophila, zebrafish, murine and other systems suggests that BMP ligand heterodimers are the primary BMP signaling ligand, even in systems in which mixtures of BMP homodimers and heterodimers are present. Signaling by heterodimers occurs through a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex comprising of two distinct type one BMP receptors and two type II receptors. To understand the system dynamics and determine whether kinetic assembly of heterodimer-heterotetramer BMP complexes is favored, as compared to other plausible BMP ligand-receptor configurations, we developed a kinetic model for BMP tetramer formation based on current measurements for binding rates and affinities. We find that contrary to a common hypothesis, heterodimer-heterotetramer formation is <i>not</i> kinetically favored over the formation of homodimer-tetramer complexes under physiological conditions of receptor and ligand concentrations and therefore other mechanisms, potentially including differential kinase activities of the formed heterotetramer complexes, must be the cause of heterodimer-heterotetramer signaling primacy. Further, although BMP complex assembly favors homodimer and homomeric complex formation over a wide range of parameters, ignoring these signals and instead relying on the heterodimer improves the range of morphogen interpretation in a broad set of conditions, suggesting a performance advantage for heterodimer signaling in patterning multiple cell types in a gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The critical balance between dopamine D2 receptor and RGS for the sensitive detection of a transient decay in dopamine signal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hidetoshi Urakubo, Sho Yagishita, Haruo Kasai, Yoshiyuki Kubota, Shin Ishii</p>

In behavioral learning, reward-related events are encoded into phasic dopamine (DA) signals in the brain. In particular, unexpected reward omission leads to a phasic decrease in DA (DA dip) in the striatum, which triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) in DA D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing spiny-projection neurons (D2 SPNs). While this LTP is required for reward discrimination, it is unclear how such a short DA-dip signal (0.5–2 s) is transferred through intracellular signaling to the coincidence detector, adenylate cyclase (AC). In the present study, we built a computational model of D2 signaling to determine conditions for the DA-dip detection. The DA dip can be detected only if the basal DA signal sufficiently inhibits AC, and the DA-dip signal sufficiently disinhibits AC. We found that those two requirements were simultaneously satisfied only if two key molecules, D2R and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) were balanced within a certain range; this balance has indeed been observed in experimental studies. We also found that high level of RGS was required for the detection of a 0.5-s short DA dip, and the analytical solutions for these requirements confirmed their universality. The imbalance between D2R and RGS is associated with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia, both of which are accompanied by abnormal striatal LTP. Our simulations suggest that D2 SPNs in patients with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia cannot detect short DA dips. We finally discussed that such psychiatric and movement disorders can be understood in terms of the imbalance between D2R and RGS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Mathematical learning deficits originate in early childhood from atypical development of a frontoparietal brain network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ulrike Kuhl, Sarah Sobotta, Legascreen Consortium , Michael A. Skeide</p>

Mathematical learning deficits are defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder (dyscalculia) in the International Classification of Diseases. It is not known, however, how such deficits emerge in the course of early brain development. Here, we conducted functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments in 3- to 6-year-old children without formal mathematical learning experience. We followed this sample until the age of 7 to 9 years, identified individuals who developed deficits, and matched them to a typically developing control group using comprehensive behavioral assessments. Multivariate pattern classification distinguished future cases from controls with up to 87% accuracy based on the regional functional activity of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the network-level functional activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the effective functional and structural connectivity of these regions. Our results indicate that mathematical learning deficits originate from atypical development of a frontoparietal network that is already detectable in early childhood.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic Influence on Slow Wave Slope Renormalization During Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition, making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extrathalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalographic overnight slow wave slope changes and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extrathalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration, or apnea–hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extrathalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke, a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures and post-stroke epilepsy after acute ischemic stroke and evaluate the effects of reperfusion treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the risk factors for post-stroke seizures using logistic or Cox regression in a multicenter study, including adults from 8 European referral centers with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We compared the risk of post-stroke seizures between participants with or without reperfusion treatment following propensity score matching to reduce confounding due to treatment selection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall cohort of 4,229 participants (mean age 71 years, 57% men), a higher risk of acute symptomatic seizures was observed in those with more severe strokes, infarcts located in the posterior cerebral artery territory, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Strokes caused by small-vessel occlusion carried a small risk of acute symptomatic seizures. 6% developed post-stroke epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy were acute symptomatic seizures, more severe strokes, infarcts involving the cerebral cortex, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Electroencephalography findings within 7 days of stroke onset were not independently associated with the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. There was no association between reperfusion treatments in general or only intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with the time to post-stroke epilepsy or the risk of acute symptomatic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Post-stroke seizures are related to stroke severity, etiology, and location, whereas an early electroencephalogram was not predictive of epilepsy. We did not find an association of reperfusion treatment with risks of acute symptomatic seizures or post-stroke epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using multiple outcomes in intervention studies for improved trade-off between power and type I errors:   the Adjust NVar approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials recommend use of a single primary outcome, to guard against the raised risk of false positive findings when multiple measures are considered. It is, however, possible to include a suite of multiple outcomes in an intervention study, while controlling the familywise error rate, if the criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis specifies that N or more of the outcomes reach an agreed level of statistical significance, where N depends on the total number of outcome measures included in the study, and the correlation between them.  Methods  Simulations were run, using a conventional null-hypothesis significance testing approach with alpha set at .05, to explore the case when between 2 and 12 outcome measures are included to compare two groups, with average correlation between measures ranging from zero to .8, and true effect size ranging from 0 to .7. In step 1, a table is created giving the minimum N significant outcomes (MinNSig) that is required for a given set of outcome measures to control the familywise error rate at 5%. In step 2, data are simulated using MinNSig values for each set of correlated outcomes and the resulting proportion of significant results is computed for different sample sizes,correlations, and effect sizes.  Results  The Adjust NVar approach can achieve a more efficient trade-off between power and type I error rate than use of a single outcome when there are three or more moderately intercorrelated outcome variables.  Conclusions  Where it is feasible to have a suite of moderately correlated outcome measures, then this might be a more efficient approach than reliance on a single primary outcome measure in an intervention study. In effect, it builds in an internal replication to the study. This approach can also be used to evaluate published intervention studies.

                Background: Insulin resistance has been independently associated with cardiac diseases. A free fatty acid is recently known to induce cardiac insulin resistance due to low-grade inflammation. Therefore, the improvement of free fatty acid levels can also improve cardiac insulin resistance. This study investigated the combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract in improvement of free fatty acid-induced cardiac insulin resistance by improving the adiponectin/FAS pathway. Methods: This study used 25 males Sprague-Dawley rats induced by a high-fat high sucrose diet and injection of low dose streptozotocin to make a metabolic syndrome (MS) rat model and standard chow as healthy control rats. The MS rats were treated with green tea (200 mg/ b. w.), decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee (300 mg/ b. w.), and the combination of both extracts in 9 weeks. Experimental groups in this study were divided into 5 groups: 1) MS (HFHS diet + STZ) group, 2) NC (normal chow) group, 3) GT (green tea extract) group, 4) GC (decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract), 5) CM (combination of both extracts) group. Adiponectin and HOMA-IR level was analysed using ELISA, and the gene expression of Adipo-R1, FAS, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, GLUT4 was measured by RT-PCR. Results: The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee showed synergistic effects in improving FFA levels. The adiponectin/FAS pathway was attenuated in the CM group. Moreover, the combination also showed improvement in cardiac insulin resistance markers such as IRS1/2, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and GLUT4. Conclusions:  The combination of green tea and decaffeinated-light roasted green coffee extract improved cardiac insulin resistance better than green tea and green coffee extract administration alone by reducing free fatty acids levels through adiponectin/FAS pathway modulation.

                Online accounts to keep track of scientific publications, such as Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) or Google Scholar, can be time consuming to maintain and synchronize. Furthermore, the open access status of publications is often not easily accessible, hindering potential opening of closed publications. To lessen the burden of managing personal profiles, we developed a R shiny app that allows publication lists from multiple platforms to be retrieved and consolidated, as well as interactive exploration and comparison of publication profiles. A live version can be found at pubassistant.ch.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques cause more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is a very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating augmented reality technology in education: vector personal computer augmented reality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Educators often face difficulties in explaining abstract concepts such as vectors. During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, fully online classes have also caused additional challenges to using conventional teaching methods. To explain a vector concept of more than 2 dimensions, visualization becomes a problem. Although Microsoft PowerPoint can integrate animation, the illustration is still in 2-dimensions. Augmented reality (AR) technology is recommended to aid educators and students in teaching-learning vectors, namely via a vector personal computer augmented reality system (VPCAR), to fulfil the demand for tools to support the learning and teaching of vectors. Methods: A PC learning module for vectors was developed in a 3-dimensional coordinate system by using AR technology. Purposive sampling was applied to get feedback from educators and students in Malaysia through an online survey. The supportiveness of using VPCAR based on six items (attractiveness, easiness, visualization, conceptual understanding, inspiration and helpfulness) was recorded on 5-points Likert-type scales. Findings are presented descriptively and graphically. Results: Surprisingly, both students and educators adapted to the new technology easily and provided significant positive feedback that showed a left-skewed and J-shaped distribution for each measurement item, respectively. The distributions were proven significantly different among the students and educators, where supportive level result of educators was higher than students. This study introduced a PC learning module other than mobile apps as students mostly use laptops to attend online class and educators also engage other IT tools in their teaching. Conclusions: Based on these findings, VPCAR provides a good prospect in supporting educators and students during their online teaching-learning process. However, the findings may not be generalizable to all students and educators in Malaysia as purposive sampling was applied. Further studies may focus on government-funded schools using the newly developed VPCAR system, which is the novelty of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 futility trial of 200mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening MRI. The primary endpoint was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon two-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary endpoint, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. (<a target="_blank"

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparative Effectiveness of Stereo‐EEG versus Subdural Grids in Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), the two predominant methods of intracranial EEG (iEEG) performed in difficult to localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005-2019 with ≥ 1 year follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints: 1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; 2) seizure-freedom at last follow-up; and 3) complications (composite of either post-operative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurologic deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from seven countries and three continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE, 942 SEEG) of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.05 – 1.84), and higher odds of complications (OR=2.24, 95% CI 1.34-3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs. 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure-freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared to SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure-free after SEEG-guided resections vs. 41% after SDE)</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure-freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three week-old piglets (n=29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60min) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60min). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD.</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming</p>

                Astrocytes are essential cells of the central nervous system, characterized by dynamic relationships with neurons that range from functional metabolic interactions and regulation of neuronal firing activities, to the release of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic neurons are progressively lost during the course of the disease, but the effects of PD on astrocytes and astrocyte-to-neuron communication remains largely unknown. This study focuses on the effects of the PD-related mutation LRRK2 G2019S in astrocytes generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We report the alteration of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis in astrocytes, and we identify the abnormal accumulation of key PD-related proteins within multi vesicular bodies (MVBs). We found that dopaminergic neurons internalize astrocyte-secreted EVs and that LRRK2 G2019S EVs are abnormally enriched in neurites and fail to provide full neurotrophic support to dopaminergic neurons. Thus, dysfunctional astrocyte-to-neuron communication via altered EV biological properties may participate in the progression of PD.

                Enzymatic pathways have evolved uniquely preferred protein expression stoichiometry in living cells, but our ability to predict the optimal abundances from basic properties remains underdeveloped. Here we report a biophysical, first-principles model of growth optimization for core mRNA translation, a multi-enzyme system that involves proteins with a broadly conserved stoichiometry spanning two orders of magnitude. We show that predictions from maximization of ribosome usage in a parsimonious flux model constrained by proteome allocation agree with the conserved ratios of translation factors. The analytical solutions, without free parameters, provide an interpretable framework for the observed hierarchy of expression levels based on simple biophysical properties, such as diffusion constants and protein sizes. Our results provide an intuitive and quantitative understanding for the construction of a central process of life, as well as a path toward rational design of pathway-specific enzyme expression stoichiometry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adult stem cells and niche cells segregate gradually from common precursors that build the adult Drosophila ovary during pupal development</a></h4>

              
                Production of proliferative Follicle Cells (FCs) and quiescent Escort Cells (ECs) by Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) in adult Drosophila ovaries is regulated by niche signals from anterior (Cap Cells, ECs) and posterior (polar FCs) sources. Here we show that ECs, FSCs and FCs develop from common pupal precursors, with different fates acquired by progressive separation of cells along the AP axis and a graded decline in anterior cell proliferation. ECs, FSCs and most FCs derive from Intermingled Cell (IC) precursors interspersed with germline cells. Precursors also accumulate posterior to ICs before engulfing a naked germline cyst projected out of the germarium to form the first egg chamber and posterior polar FC signaling center. Thus, stem and niche cells develop in appropriate numbers and spatial organization through regulated proliferative expansion together with progressive establishment of spatial signaling cues that guide adult cell behavior, rather than through rigid early specification events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Localization of KRAS downstream target ARL4C to invasive pseudopods accelerates pancreatic cancer cell invasion</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate due to metastasis. Whereas KRAS is mutated in most pancreatic cancer patients, controlling KRAS or its downstream effectors has not been succeeded clinically. ARL4C is a small G protein whose expression is induced by the Wnt and EGF-RAS pathways. In the present study, we found that ARL4C is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer patients and showed that its localization to invasive pseudopods is required for cancer cell invasion. IQGAP1 was identified as a novel interacting protein for ARL4C. ARL4C recruited IQGAP1 and its downstream effector, MMP14, to invasive pseudopods. Specific localization of ARL4C, IQGAP1, and MMP14 was the active site of invasion, which induced degradation of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, subcutaneously injected antisense oligonucleotide against ARL4C into tumor-bearing mice suppressed metastasis of pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that ARL4C-IQGAP1-MMP14 signaling is activated at invasive pseudopods of pancreatic cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Principles of mRNA targeting via the Arabidopsis m6A-binding protein ECT2</a></h4>

              
                Specific recognition of <i>N6</i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in mRNA by RNA-binding proteins containing a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain is important in eukaryotic gene regulation. The Arabidopsis YTH-domain protein ECT2 is thought to bind to mRNA at URU(m<sup>6</sup>A)Y sites, yet RR(m<sup>6</sup>A)CH is the canonical m<sup>6</sup>A consensus site in all eukaryotes and ECT2 functions require m<sup>6</sup>A binding activity. Here, we apply iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) and HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to define high-quality target sets of ECT2, and analyze the patterns of enriched sequence motifs around ECT2 crosslink sites. Our analyses show that ECT2 does in fact bind to RR(m<sup>6</sup>A)CH. Pyrimidine-rich motifs are enriched around, but not at m<sup>6</sup>A-sites, reflecting a preference for <i>N6</i>-adenosine methylation of RRACH/GGAU islands in pyrimidine-rich regions. Such motifs, particularly oligo-U and UNUNU upstream of m<sup>6</sup>A sites, are also implicated in ECT2 binding via its intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Finally, URUAY-type motifs are enriched at ECT2 crosslink sites, but their distinct properties suggest function as sites of competition between binding of ECT2 and as yet unidentified RNA-binding proteins. Our study provides coherence between genetic and molecular studies of m<sup>6</sup>A-YTH function in plants, and reveals new insight into the mode of RNA recognition by YTH-domain-containing proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutational analysis to explore long-range allosteric couplings involved in a pentameric channel receptor pre-activation and activation</a></h4>

              
                Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate chemical signaling through a succession of allosteric transitions that are yet not completely understood as intermediate states remain poorly characterized by structural approaches. In a previous study on the prototypic bacterial proton-gated channel GLIC, we generated several fluorescent sensors of the protein conformation that report a fast transition to a pre-active state, which precedes the slower process of activation with pore opening. Here, we explored the phenotype of a series of allosteric mutations, using paralleled steady-state fluorescence and electrophysiological measurements over a broad pH range. Our data, fitted to a 3-states Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model, show that mutations at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD) principally alter pre-activation, while mutations in the lower ECD and in the transmembrane domain principally alter activation. We also show that propofol alters both transitions. Data are discussed in the framework of transition pathways generated by normal mode analysis (iModFit) that suggest collective protein motions concerted with pore opening. It further supports that pre-activation involves major quaternary compaction of the ECD, and suggests that activation involves principally a re-organization of a 'central gating region' involving a contraction of the ECD β-sandwich and the tilt of the channel lining M2 helix.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A MET-PTPRK kinase-phosphatase rheostat controls ZNRF3 and Wnt signalling</a></h4>

              
                Zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Wnt receptors for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Previously we showed that dephosphorylation of an endocytic tyrosine motif (4Y motif) in ZNRF3 by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) promotes ZNRF3 internalization and Wnt receptor degradation (Chang et al. 2020). However, a responsible protein tyrosine kinase(s) (PTK) phosphorylating the 4Y motif remained elusive. Here we identify the proto-oncogene MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) as a 4Y kinase. MET binds to ZNRF3 and induces 4Y phosphorylation, stimulated by the MET ligand HGF (hepatocyte growth factor, scatter factor). HGF-MET signalling reduces ZNRF3-dependent Wnt receptor degradation thereby enhancing Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Conversely, depletion or pharmacological inhibition of MET promotes internalization of ZNRF3 and Wnt receptor degradation. We conclude that HGF-MET signalling phosphorylates- and PTPRK dephosphorylates ZNRF3 to regulate ZNRF3 internalization, functioning as a rheostat for Wnt signalling that may offer novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of mycobacterial CIII2CIV2 respiratory supercomplex bound to the tuberculosis drug candidate telacebec (Q203)</a></h4>

              
                The imidazopyridine telacebec, also known as Q203, is one of only a few new classes of compounds in more than fifty years with demonstrated antituberculosis activity in humans. Telacebec inhibits the mycobacterial respiratory supercomplex composed of complexes III and IV (CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub>). In mycobacterial electron transport chains, CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> replaces canonical CIII and CIV, transferring electrons from the intermediate carrier menaquinol to the final acceptor, molecular oxygen, while simultaneously transferring protons across the inner membrane to power ATP synthesis. We show that telacebec inhibits the menaquinol:oxygen oxidoreductase activity of purified <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> at concentrations similar to those needed to inhibit electron transfer in mycobacterial membranes and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth in culture. We then used electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to determine structures of CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> both in the presence and absence of telacebec. The structures suggest that telacebec prevents menaquinol oxidation by blocking two different menaquinol binding modes to prevent CIII<sub>2</sub>CIV<sub>2</sub> activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Members of the ELMOD protein family specify formation of distinct aperture domains on the Arabidopsis pollen surface</a></h4>

              
                Pollen apertures, the characteristic gaps in pollen wall exine, have emerged as a model for studying the formation of distinct plasma membrane domains. In each species, aperture number, position, and morphology are typically fixed; across species they vary widely. During pollen development, certain plasma membrane domains attract specific proteins and lipids and become protected from exine deposition, developing into apertures. However, how these aperture domains are selected is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that patterns of aperture domains in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are controlled by the members of the ancient ELMOD protein family, which, although important in animals, has not been studied in plants. We show that two members of this family, MACARON (MCR) and ELMOD_A, act upstream of the previously discovered aperture proteins and that their expression levels influence the number of aperture domains that form on the surface of developing pollen grains. We also show that a third ELMOD family member, ELMOD_E, can interfere with MCR and ELMOD_A activities, changing aperture morphology and producing new aperture patterns. Our findings reveal key players controlling early steps in aperture domain formation, identify residues important for their function, and open new avenues for investigating how diversity of aperture patterns in nature is achieved.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation and compensation in a bacterial gene regulatory network evolving under antibiotic selection</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulatory networks allow organisms to generate coordinated responses to environmental challenges. In bacteria, regulatory networks are re-wired and re-purposed during evolution, though the relationship between selection pressures and evolutionary change is poorly understood. In this study, we discover that the early evolutionary response of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to the antibiotic trimethoprim involves derepression of PhoPQ signaling, an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive two-component system, by inactivation of the MgrB feedback-regulatory protein. We report that derepression of PhoPQ confers trimethoprim-tolerance to <i>E. coli</i> by hitherto unrecognized transcriptional upregulation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), target of trimethoprim. As a result, mutations in <i>mgrB</i> precede and facilitate the evolution of drug resistance. Using laboratory evolution, genome sequencing, and mutation re-construction, we show that populations of <i>E. coli</i> challenged with trimethoprim are faced with the evolutionary ‘choice’ of transitioning from tolerant to resistant by mutations in DHFR, or compensating for the fitness costs of PhoPQ derepression by inactivating the RpoS sigma factor, itself a PhoPQ-target. Outcomes at this evolutionary branch-point are determined by the strength of antibiotic selection, such that high pressures favor resistance, while low pressures favor cost compensation. Our results relate evolutionary changes in bacterial gene regulatory networks to strength of selection and provide mechanistic evidence to substantiate this link.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The YTHDF proteins ECT2 and ECT3 bind largely overlapping target sets and influence target mRNA abundance, not alternative polyadenylation</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulation via <i>N6</i>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in mRNA involves RNA-binding proteins that recognize m<sup>6</sup>A via a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain. The plant YTH domain proteins ECT2 and ECT3 act genetically redundantly in stimulating cell proliferation during organogenesis, but several fundamental questions regarding their mode of action remain unclear. Here, we use HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to show that most ECT2 and ECT3 targets overlap, with only few examples of preferential targeting by either of the two proteins. HyperTRIBE in different mutant backgrounds also provides direct views of redundant and specific target interactions of the two proteins. We also show that contrary to conclusions of previous reports, ECT2 does not accumulate in the nucleus. Accordingly, inactivation of <i>ECT2</i>, <i>ECT3</i> and their surrogate <i>ECT4</i> does not change patterns of polyadenylation site choice in ECT2/3 target mRNAs, but does lead to lower steady state accumulation of target mRNAs. In addition, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles show indications of stress response activation in <i>ect2/ect3/ect4</i> mutants, likely via indirect effects. Thus, previous suggestions of control of alternative polyadenylation by ECT2 are not supported by evidence, and ECT2 and ECT3 act largely redundantly to regulate target mRNA, including its abundance, in the cytoplasm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social framing effects in decision making</a></h4>

              
                Human decisions are known to be strongly influenced by the manner in which options are presented, the "framing effect". Here, we ask whether decision-makers are also influenced by how advice from other knowledgeable agents are framed, a "social framing effect". Concretely, do students learn better from a teacher who often frames advice by emphasizing appetitive outcomes, or do they learn better from another teacher who usually emphasizes avoiding options that can be harmful to their progress? We study the computational and neural mechanisms by which framing of advice affect decision-making, social learning, and trust. We found that human participants are more likely to trust and follow an adviser who often uses an appetitive frame for advice compared with another one who often uses an aversive frame. This social framing effect is implemented through a modulation of the integrative abilities of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. At the time of choice, this region combines information learned via personal experiences of reward with social information, but the combination differs depending on the social framing of advice. Personally-acquired information is weighted more strongly when dealing with an adviser who uses an aversive frame. The findings suggest that social advice is systematically incorporated into our decisions, while being affected by biases similar to those influencing individual value-based learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Radical pairs may play a role in microtubule reorganization</a></h4>

              
                The exact mechanism behind general anesthesia remains an open question in neuroscience. It has been proposed that anesthetics selectively prevent consciousness and memory via acting on microtubules (MTs). It is known that the magnetic field modulates MT organization. A recent study shows that a radical pair model can explain the isotope effect in xenon-induced anesthesia and predicts magnetic field effects on anesthetic potency. Further, reactive oxygen species are also implicated in MT stability and anesthesia. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model and a simple mathematical model of MT organization, we show that magnetic fields can modulate spin dynamics of naturally occurring radical pairs in MT. We show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the reaction cycle, which translates into a change in the MT density. We can reproduce magnetic field effects on the MT concentration that have been observed. Our model also predicts additional effects at slightly higher fields. Our model further predicts that the effect of zinc on the MT density exhibits isotopic dependence. The findings of this work make a connection between microtubule-based and radical pair-based quantum theories of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Numb reduces Tau levels and prevents neurodegeneration in mouse models of tauopathy in an isoform-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is linked to neuronal cell death in tauopathies, but how exactly intraneuronal Tau levels are regulated in health and disease remains unclear. Here we identify the trafficking adaptor protein Numb as an essential regulator of Tau homeostasis. Conditional inactivation of Numb in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) increases monomeric and oligomeric Tau levels, leading to axonal blebbing followed by neuronal cell loss in aged mice. Moreover, in a mouse model of tauopathy, inactivation of Numb in RGCs and spinal motoneurons accelerates neurodegeneration, and leads to precocious hindlimb paralysis. Conversely, overexpression of the long isoform of Numb (Numb-72), but not other isoforms, decreases intracellular Tau levels by promoting the extracellular release of monomeric Tau, and AAV-mediated delivery of Numb-72 in RGCs in vivo prevents neurodegeneration in two different mouse models of tauopathy. Taken together, these results uncover Numb as a modulator of intracellular Tau levels and identify Numb-72 as a novel therapeutic factor for tauopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Estimates of Curvilinear Self-Motion from Neural Signals in a Model of Primate MSTd</a></h4>

              
                Self-motion produces characteristic patterns of optic flow on the eye of the mobile observer. Movement along linear, straight paths without eye movements yields motion that radiates from the direction of travel (heading). The observer experiences more complex motion patterns while moving along more general curvilinear (e.g. circular) paths, the appearance of which depends on the radius of the curved path (path curvature) and the direction of gaze. Neurons in brain area MSTd of primate visual cortex exhibit tuning to radial motion patterns and have been linked with linear heading perception. MSTd also contains neurons that exhibit tuning to spirals, but their function is not well understood. We investigated in a computational model whether MSTd, through its diverse pattern tuning, could support estimation of a broader range of self-motion parameters from optic flow than has been previously demonstrated. We used deep learning to decode these parameters from signals produced by neurons tuned to radial expansion, spiral, ground flow, and other patterns in a mechanistic neural model of MSTd. Specifically, we found that we could accurately decode the clockwise/counterclockwise sign of curvilinear path and the gaze direction relative to the path tangent from spiral cells; heading from radial cells; and the curvature (radius) of the curvilinear path from activation produced by both radial and spiral populations. We demonstrate accurate decoding of these linear and curvilinear self-motion parameters in both synthetic and naturalistic videos of simulated self-motion. Estimates remained stable over time, while also rapidly adapting to dynamic changes in the observers curvilinear self-motion. Our findings suggest that specific populations of neurons in MSTd could effectively signal important aspects of the observers linear and curvilinear self-motion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finding landmarks - An investigation of viewing behavior during spatial navigation in VR using a graph-theoretical analysis approach</a></h4>

              
                Vision provides the most important sensory information for spatial navigation. Recent technical advances allow new options to conduct more naturalistic experiments in virtual reality (VR) while additionally gather data of the viewing behavior with eye tracking investigations. Here, we propose a method that allows to quantify characteristics of visual behavior by using graph-theoretical measures to abstract eye tracking data recorded in a 3D virtual urban environment. The analysis is based on eye tracking data of 20 participants, who freely explored the virtual city Seahaven for 90 minutes with an immersive VR headset with an inbuild eye tracker. To extract what participants looked at, we defined "gaze" events, from which we created gaze graphs. On these, we applied graph-theoretical measures to reveal the underlying structure of visual attention. Applying graph partitioning, we found that our virtual environment could be treated as one coherent city. To investigate the importance of houses in the city, we applied the node degree centrality measure. Our results revealed that 10 houses had a node degree that exceeded consistently two-sigma distance from the mean node degree of all other houses. The importance of these houses was supported by the hierarchy index, which showed a clear hierarchical structure of the gaze graphs. As these high node degree houses fulfilled several characteristics of landmarks, we named them "gaze-graph-defined landmarks". Applying the rich club coefficient, we found that these gaze-graph-defined landmarks were preferentially connected to each other and that participants spend the majority of their experiment time in areas where at least two of those houses were visible. Our findings do not only provide new experimental evidence for the development of spatial knowledge, but also establish a new methodology to identify and assess the function of landmarks in spatial navigation based on eye tracking data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Genetic Platform for Functionally Profiling Odorant Receptors Ex Vivo Using Olfactory Cilia.</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis for odor perception in humans remains a black box as odorant receptors (ORs) are notoriously difficult to study outside of their native environment. Efforts toward OR expression and functional profiling in heterologous systems have been met with limited success due to poor efficiency of cell surface expression and consequently reduced G-protein signal amplification. We previously reported a genetic strategy in mice to increase the number of sensory neurons expressing specific ORs, which transforms the 10 million neurons of the mouse nose into a bioreactor producing large quantities of fully functional OR protein. We now describe the isolation of cilia from these bioreactors for two human ORs. Cilia are known to contain all components of the olfactory signal transduction machinery and can be placed into an ex vivo well-plate assay to rapidly measure robust, reproducible odor-specific responses. Our OR1A1 and OR5AN1 isolated cilia reveal 10-100fold more sensitivity than existing assays. Tissue from a single animal produces up to 4,000 384-well assay wells, and isolated olfactory cilia can be stored frozen and thus preserved for long term usage. This pipeline offers a sensitive, highly scalable ex vivo odor screening platform that opens the door for decoding human olfaction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Here's the twist: How the brain updates naturalistic event memories as our understanding of the past changes</a></h4>

              
                The brain actively reshapes past memories in light of new incoming information. In the current study, we ask how the brain supports this updatinge process during the encoding and recall of naturalistic stimuli. One group of participants watched a movie ("The Sixth Sense") with a cinematic "twist" at the end that dramatically changed the interpretation of previous events. Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new "twist" information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating. Our results demonstrate that neural representations of past events encoded in the DMN are dynamically integrated with new information that reshapes our memory in natural contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced nociception in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy</a></h4>

              
                The most prevalent comorbidity of cerebral palsy (CP) is pain. In order to investigate the relationship between perinatal injuries that cause CP and nociception, we investigated mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), sham surgery without hypoxia, and after a typical, unperturbed gestation. A range of motor deficits were observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 minutes at 70-80% gestation) as previously described. We found that HI caused mechanical and thermal allodynia at postnatal day 5, which was accompanied by an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene related peptide; CGRP) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn. Non-peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of isolectin B4; IB4) were unaltered in HI kits but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Interestingly, HI-subjected rabbits exhibited allodynia, even in the absence of motor deficits. HI motor affected and unaffected kits had similar thermal sensitivity but affected kits had less mechanical sensitivity than HI unaffected kits. These findings suggest that prenatal neural injuries impact sensory and motor networks independently and that developing sensory circuits may be more vulnerable than motor circuits to perturbation by prenatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. In conclusion, pain experienced by individuals with CP could arise from developmental insults capable of causing the condition, and therapeutics that specifically target altered nociception in these individuals could be beneficial for treating and preventing chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction of Inefficient BCI Users based on Cognitive Skills and Personality Traits</a></h4>

              
                BCI inefficiency is one of the major challenges of motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI). Past research suggests that certain cognitive skills and personality traits correlate with MI-BCI real-time performance. Other studies have examined sensorimotor rhythm changes (also known as mu suppression) as a valuable indicator of successful execution of the MI task. This research aims to combine these insights by investigating whether cognitive factors and personality traits can make predictions of a users ability to modulate mu rhythms during a MI-BCI task. Data containing 55 subjects who completed a MI task was employed, and a stepwise linear regression model was implemented to select the most relevant features for mu suppression prediction. The most accurate model was based on these factors: Spatial Ability, Visuospatial Memory, Autonomy, and Vividness of Visual Imagery. Further correlation analyses showed that a novice users mu suppression during a MI-BCI task can be predicted based on their visuospatial memory ability, as measured by the Design Organization Test (DOT).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Face masks impair reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker</a></h4>

              
                Face masks have become a prevalent measure during the Covid-19 pandemic to counteract the transmission of SARS-CoV 2. An unintended 'side-effect' of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral graph theory of brain oscillations -- revisited and improved</a></h4>

              
                Mathematical modeling of the relationship between the functional activity and the structural wiring of the brain has largely been undertaken using non-linear and biophysically detailed mathematical models with regionally varying parameters. While this approach provides us a rich repertoire of multistable dynamics that can be displayed by the brain, it is computationally demanding. Moreover, although neuronal dynamics at the microscopic level are nonlinear and chaotic, it is unclear if such detailed nonlinear models are required to capture the emergent meso- (regional population ensemble) and macro-scale (whole brain) behavior, which is largely deterministic and reproducible across individuals. Indeed, recent modeling effort based on spectral graph theory has shown that an analytical model without regionally varying parameters can capture the empirical magnetoencephalography frequency spectra and the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands accurately. In this work, we demonstrate an improved hierarchical, linearized, and analytic spectral graph theory-based model that can capture the frequency spectra obtained from magnetoencephalography recordings of resting healthy subjects. We reformulated the spectral graph theory model in line with classical neural mass models, therefore providing more biologically interpretable parameters, especially at the local scale. We demonstrated that this model performs better than the original model when comparing the spectral correlation of modeled frequency spectra and that obtained from the magnetoencephalography recordings. This model also performs equally well in predicting the spatial patterns of the empirical alpha and beta frequency bands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the reliability, validity, and utility of overlapping networks: Implications for cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Brain regions can be consistently clustered together into a small number of large-scale networks based on the correlation of their activity across time. However, the methods typically used to assign regions to these networks typically force non- or minimal overlap between the networks, losing information about how particular regions may connect to multiple networks. However, new methods are emerging that allow networks to overlap. Here, we examined the reliability and validity of one such assignment method, the mixed membership algorithm, and the utility of overlapping assignment for identifying potential gaps in existing network models of behavior. Analyses were conducted on resting state data from a large set of participants. First, we split the data into two halves and generated group-level overlapping networks for each subgroup. We then used a bootstrapped Dice similarity analysis to demonstrate that the binarized network topographies showed good agreement between subgroups. Next, we generated nonoverlapping networks in the combined data using a typical k-means clustering method. Using the same Dice Similarity analysis, we compared these nonoverlapping networks both with previously published nonoverlapping networks (Yeo et al, 2011) and with overlapping networks likewise generated for the combined data. The nonoverlapping networks generally recapitulated known networks in the literature, and the overlapping networks captured large portions of one to three nonoverlapping network topographies. Following this, we used a relative entropy analysis to assess the uniformity of each region's distribution of connections across the overlapping networks. While many regions were indeed assigned to one network, more were assigned to multiple networks. Furthermore, regions assigned to multiple networks did not necessarily show stronger connection to one network over the others. Finally, we assessed the network membership of regions of the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks of the Dual-Networks model of cognitive control. In combination, the regions were members of all of the overlapping networks, and the majority were assigned to multiple networks. Together, these results indicate that overlapping assignment produces consistent and biologically plausible network topographies, and that a complete network model of cognitive control, or indeed any network model of behavior needs to be updated to account for multiple-network membership and the complex interactions that occur between the relevant networks as a function of their overlapping nature.

                The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons requires a precise combination of extrinsic factors that recapitulates the in vivo environment and timing. Current methods are capable of generating authentic mesDA neurons after long-term culture in vitro; however, when mesDA progenitors are transplanted in vivo, the resulting mesDA neurons are only minor components of the graft. This low yield hampers the broad use of these cells in the clinic. In this study, we genetically modified pluripotent stem cells to generate a novel type of stem cells called lineage-restricted undifferentiated stem cells (LR-USCs), which robustly generate mesDA neurons. LR-USCs are prevented from differentiating into a broad range of nondopaminergic cell types by knocking out genes that are critical for the specification of cells of alternate lineages. Specifically, we target transcription factors involved in the production of spinal cord and posterior hindbrain cell types. When LR-USCs are differentiated under caudalizing condition, which normally give rise to hindbrain cell types, a large proportion adopt a midbrain identity and develop into authentic mesDA neurons. We show that the mesDA neurons are electrophysiologically active, and due to their higher purity, are capable of restoring motor behavior eight weeks after transplantation into 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. This novel strategy improves the reliability and scalability of mesDA neuron generation for clinical use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Light-regulated SIK1 remodels the synaptic phosphoproteome to induce sleep</a></h4>

              
                The sleep and circadian systems act in concert to regulate sleep-wake timing, yet the molecular mechanisms that underpin their interaction to induce sleep remain unknown. Synaptic protein phosphorylation, driven by the kinase SIK3, correlates with sleep pressure, however it is unclear whether these phosphoproteome changes are causally responsible for inducing sleep. Here we show that the light-dependent activity of SIK1 controls the phosphorylation of a subset of the brain phosphoproteome to induce sleep in a manner that is independent of sleep pressure. By uncoupling phosphorylation and sleep induction from sleep pressure, we establish that synaptic protein phosphorylation provides a causal mechanism for the induction of sleep under different environmental contexts. Furthermore, we propose a framework that details how the salt-inducible kinases regulate the synaptic phosphoproteome to integrate exogenous and endogenous stimuli, thereby providing the molecular basis upon which the sleep and circadian systems interact to control the sleep-wake cycle.

                Membrane excitability and cell-to-cell communication in the brain are tightly regulated by diverse ion channels and receptor proteins localized to distinct membrane compartments. Currently, a major technical barrier in cellular neuroscience is lack of reliable methods to label these membrane proteins and image their sub-cellular localization and dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we devised optical imaging strategies that enable systematic characterization of subcellular composition, relative abundances and trafficking dynamics of membrane proteins at nanometer scales in cultured neurons as well as in the brain. Using these methods, we revealed exquisite developmental regulation of subcellular distributions of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Nav1.2 and Nav1.6, settling a decade long debate regarding the molecular identity of sodium channels in dendrites. In addition, we discovered a previously uncharacterized trafficking pathway that targets Nav1.2 to unmyelinated fragments in the distal axon. Myelination counteracts this pathway, facilitating the installment of Nav1.6 as the dominant VGSC in the axon. Together, these imaging approaches unveiled compartment-specific trafficking mechanisms underpinning differential membrane distributions of VGSCs and open avenues to decipher how membrane protein localization and dynamics contribute to neural computation in the brain.

                Previous work has sought to understand decision confidence as a prediction of the probability that a decision will be correct, leading to debate over whether these predictions are optimal, and whether they rely on the same decision variable as decisions themselves. This work has generally relied on idealized, low-dimensional modeling frameworks, such as signal detection theory or Bayesian inference, leaving open the question of how decision confidence operates in the domain of high-dimensional, naturalistic stimuli. To address this, we developed a deep neural network model optimized to assess decision confidence directly given high-dimensional inputs such as images. The model naturally accounts for a number of puzzling dissociations between decisions and confidence, suggests a principled explanation of these dissociations in terms of optimization for the statistics of sensory inputs, and makes the surprising prediction that, despite these dissociations, decisions and confidence depend on a common decision variable.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational Fingerprints: Modeling Interactions Between Brain Regions as Points in a Function Space</a></h4>

              
                In this paper we propose a novel technique to investigate the nonlinear interactions between brain regions that captures both the strength and the type of the functional relationship. Inspired by the field of functional analysis, we propose that the relationship between activity in two different brain areas can be viewed as a point in function space, identified by coordinates along an infinite set of basis functions. Using Hermite Polynomials as basis functions, we estimate from fMRI data a truncated set of coordinates that serve as a "computational fingerprint," characterizing the interaction between two brain areas. We provide a proof of the convergence of the estimates in the limit, and we validate the method with simulations in which the ground truth is known, additionally showing that computational fingerprints detect statistical dependence also when correlations ("functional connectivity") is near zero. We then use computational fingerprints to examine the neural interactions with a seed region of choice: the Fusiform Face Area (FFA). Using k-means clustering across each voxel's computational fingerprint, we illustrate that the addition of the nonlinear basis functions allows for the discrimination of inter-regional interactions that are otherwise grouped together when only linear dependence is used. Finally, we show that regions in V5 and medial occipital and temporal lobes exhibit significant nonlinear interactions with the FFA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axial motion estimation and correction for simultaneous multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon imaging in behaving animals is typically accompanied by brain motion. For functional imaging experiments, for example with genetically encoded calcium indicators, such brain motion induces changes in fluorescence intensity. These motion related intensity changes or motion artifacts cannot easily be separated from neural activity induced signals. While lateral motion within the focal plane can be corrected by computationally aligning images, axial motion, out of the focal plane, cannot easily be corrected. Here, we develop an algorithm for axial motion correction for non-ratiometric calcium indicators taking advantage of simultaneous multi-plane imaging. Using at least two simultaneously recorded focal planes, the algorithm separates motion related and neural activity induced changes in fluorescence intensity. The developed motion correction approach allows axial motion estimation and correction at high frame rates for isolated structures in the imaging volume in vivo, such as sparse expression patterns in the fruit fly brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time decoding of 5 finger movements from 2 EMG channels for mixed reality human-computer interaction</a></h4>

              
                The search for optimized forms of human-computer interaction (HCI) has intensified alongside the growing potential for the combination of biosignals with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to enable the next generation of personal computing. At the core, this requires decoding the user's biosignals into digital commands. Electromyography (EMG) is a biosensor of particular interest due to the ease of data collection, the relatively high signal-to-noise-ratio, its non-invasiveness, and the ability to interpret the signal as being generated by (intentional) muscle activity. Here, we investigate the potential of using data taken from a simple 2-channel EMG setup to differentiate 5 distinct movements. In particular, EMG was recorded from two bipolar sensors over small hand muscles (extensor digitorum, flexor digitorum profundus) while a subject performed 50 trials of dorsal extension and return for each of the five digits. The maximum and the mean data values across the trial were determined for each channel and used as features. A k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification was performed and overall 5-class classification accuracy reached 94% when using the full trial's time window, while simulated real-time classification reached 90.4% accuracy when using the constructed kNN model (k=3) with a 280ms sliding window. Additionally, unsupervised learning was performed and a homogeneity of 85% was achieved. This study demonstrates that reliable decoding of different natural movements is possible with fewer than one channel per class, even without taking into account temporal features of the signal. The technical feasibility of this approach in a real-time setting was validated by sending real-time EMG data to a custom Unity3D VR application through a Lab Streaming Layer to control a user interface. Further use-cases of gamification and rehabilitation were also examined alongside integration of eye-tracking and gesture recognition for a sensor fusion approach to HCI and user intent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An open-source method for analysis of confocal calcium imaging with sparse cells</a></h4>

              
                Background: The research in the neuroscience field has evolved to use complex imaging and computational tools to extract comprehensive information from data sets. Calcium imaging is a widely used technique that requires sophisticated software to get precise and reproducible results. Many laboratories struggle to adopt computational methods due to the lack of computational knowledge and paywalls for software. New Method: Here we propose a calcium imaging analysis method using TrackMate, an open-source Fiji plugin, to track neurons at single-cell resolution, detect regions of interest (ROIs), and extract fluorescence intensities. For confocal images, this method uses the maximal value to represent the cell intensity for each z stack. This method can be done without coding or be combined with Python or Jupyter Notebook scripts to accelerate the analysis. Results: This method is validated in fly larval cool neurons, whose calcium changes in these neurons respond to temperature fluctuation. It also identifies potential problems in approaches that extract signals from maximal projection images. Comparison with existing methods: This method does not depend on programming knowledge and/or commercial software but uses open-source software and requires no coding abilities. Since TrackMate automatically defines ROIs, this method greatly avoids human error and increases reproducibility. In addition, practice images and a step-by-step guide are provided to help users adopt this method in their experiments. Conclusions: Therefore, this open-source method allows for the analysis of calcium imaging data at single-cell resolution with high reproducibility and has the potential to be applied in various cell types and animal models by researchers with different programming abilities.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of social communication and behavioral impairments. ASD typically manifests in young children, often with developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) as comorbidities. Accruing evidence indicates that ASD is highly heritable and genome-wide studies on ASD cohorts have defined numerous genetic contributors. Notably, most of these studies have been performed with individuals of European and Hispanic ancestry and thus there is a paucity of genetic analyses of ASD in the East Asian population. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 772 ASD trios from China, combining with a previous study of 369 Chinese ASD trios, to identify de novo variants in a total of 1141 ASD trios. We found that ASD probands without DD/ID carried less disruptive de novo variants, including protein-truncating and missense variants, than ASD with DD/ID. Surprisingly, we showed that expression of genes with de novo variants found in ASD probands without DD/ID were enriched in a specific group of neural progenitor cells, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying high functioning autism. Importantly, some ASD risk genes from this study are not present in the current ASD gene database, suggesting that there are novel genetic contributors to ASD in East Asian populations. We validated one such novel ASD risk gene SLC35G1 by showing that mice harboring heterozygous deletion of Slc35g1 exhibited defects in social interaction behaviors. Together, this work nominates novel ASD risk genes and indicates that ASD genetic studies in different geographic populations are essential to reveal the comprehensive genetic architecture of ASD.

                Neuronal processing is energy demanding, and relies on sugar metabolism as an energy source. To provide a constant metabolite supply neurons and glial cells express many glucose and lactate transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) 5A family. Here we dissect the partially redundant functions of three highly related glia specific Drosophila genes encoding SLC5A proteins, Rumpel, Bumpel and Kumpel. While knockdown of rumpel causes several behavioral phenotypes, they are less prominent in rumpel mutants. bumpel and kumpel mutants are viable and fertile, lacking discernible phenotypes. However, in bumpel kumpel double mutants and to an even greater extent in rumpel bumpel kumpel triple mutants oogenesis is disrupted at the onset of the vitollegenic phase. This indicates at least partially redundant functions between these genes. Rescue experiments exploring this effect indicate that oogenesis can be affected by CNS glial cells. Moreover, expression of heterologous mammalian SLC5A transporter proteins, with known transport properties, suggest that Bumpel and/or Kumpel transport glucose or lactate. Overall, our results imply a redundancy in SLC5A nutrient sensing functions in Drosophila glial cells, affecting ovarian development and behavior.

                Our mind can represent various objects from the physical world metaphorically into an abstract and complex high-dimensional object space, with a finite number of orthogonal axes encoding critical object features. Previous fMRI studies have shown that the middle fusiform sulcus in the ventral temporal cortex separates the real-world small-size map from the large-size map. Here we asked whether the feature of objects' real-world size constructed an axis of object space with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based on three criteria of sensitivity, independence and necessity that are impractical to be examined altogether with traditional approaches. A principal component analysis on features extracted by the DCNNs showed that objects' real-world size was encoded by an independent component, and the removal of this component significantly impaired DCNN's performance in recognizing objects. By manipulating stimuli, we found that the shape and texture of objects, rather than retina size, co-occurrence and task demands, accounted for the representation of the real-world size in the DCNNs. A follow-up fMRI experiment on humans further demonstrated that the shape, but not the texture, was used to infer the real-world size of objects in humans. In short, with both computational modeling and empirical human experiments, our study provided the first evidence supporting the feature of objects' real-world size as an axis of object space, and devised a novel paradigm for future exploring the structure of object space.

                Despite the recognized importance of spinal cord in sensory processing, motor behaviors and/or neural diseases, the underlying neuronal clusters remain elusive. Recently, several studies attempted to define the neuronal types and functional heterogeneity in spinal cord using single cell and/or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in varied animal models. However, the molecular evidence of neuronal heterogeneity in human spinal cord has not been established yet. Here we sought to classify spinal cord neurons from human donors by high-throughput single-nucleus RNA-sequencing. The functional heterogeneity of identified cell types and signaling pathways that connecting neuronal subtypes were explored. Moreover, we also compared human results with previous single-cell transcriptomic profiles of mouse spinal cord. As a result, we generated the first comprehensive atlas of human spinal cord neurons and defined 18 neuronal clusters. In addition to identification of the new and functionally-distinct neuronal subtypes, our results also provide novel marker genes for previously known neuronal types. The comparation with mouse transcriptomic profiles revealed an overall similarity in the cellular composition of spinal cord between the two species. In summary, these results illustrate the complexity and diversity of neuronal types in human spinal cord and will provide an important resource for future researches to explore the molecular mechanism underlying several spinal cord physiology and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) reduces cortical dendritic complexity in a TLR9-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) allow rapid and efficient gene delivery in the nervous system. AAVs are widely used in research and are the basis of multiple FDA-approved gene therapies. Here, we find that the immune response to AAV's genome reduces dendritic complexity in mammalian cortex. Dendritic loss associated with AAV-mediated gene delivery occurs at experimentally-relevant titers, cannot be explained by responses to transgene expression or surgery, and is not restricted to a particular capsid serotype, encoded transgene, promoter, or production facility. AAV-associated dendritic loss is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and upregulation of immune molecules that can limit dendritic complexity and synaptic transmission. Blocking detection of unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) protects dendritic complexity, suggesting that immunodetection of a core feature of the AAV genome triggers dendritic loss. These results reveal previously unsuspected impacts of AAV on neuronal structure and function and identify TLR9 inhibitors as important tools to improve the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal-prefrontal theta coupling develops as mice become proficient in associative odorant discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory requires coordinated activity between different regions of the brain. Here we studied the interaction between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dorsal CA1 during associative odorant discrimination learning in the mouse. We found that as the animal learns to discriminate odorants in a go-no go task the coupling of high frequency neural oscillations to the phase of theta oscillations (phase-amplitude coupling or PAC) changes in a manner that results in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odorant-elicited changes in the theta-phase referenced power (tPRP) for beta and gamma oscillations. In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in PAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task. We find that the accuracy for decoding the odorant identity from tPRP decreases in CaMKII knockout mice and that this accuracy correlates with behavioral performance. These results implicate a role for PAC and CaMKII in olfactory go-no go associative learning in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.

	<p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is involved in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased HPA axis activity can be observed during chronic stress, which plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression. Overactivity of the HPA axis occurs in major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to cognitive dysfunction and reduced mood. There is also a correlation between the HPA axis activation and gut microbiota, which has a significant impact on the development of MDD. It is believed that the gut microbiota can influence the HPA axis function through the activity of cytokines, prostaglandins, or bacterial antigens of various microbial species. The activity of the HPA axis in schizophrenia varies and depends mainly on the severity of the disease. This review summarizes the involvement of the HPA axis in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on major depression and schizophrenia, and highlights a possible correlation between these conditions. Although many effective antidepressants are available, a large proportion of patients do not respond to initial treatment. This review also discusses new therapeutic strategies that affect the HPA axis, such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, vasopressin V1B receptor antagonists and non-psychoactive CB1 receptor agonists in depression and/or schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>Although recent studies have explored the potential of multidomain brain health programs, there is a dearth of literature on operationalizing this research to create a clinical treatment program specifically for subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Patients seen by geriatricians in primary care and by behavioral neurology services at our institution presenting with SCD were recruited via a patient-appropriate flyer. After all participants had a 1-h brain health consultation with a neuropsychologist and were provided with program materials, they were randomized to attend a 10-week intervention designed to support program implementation (N = 10) or the control group of implementing the program on their own (N = 11). The program included (1) a calendar-based executive and memory support system for compensatory training and (2) training in healthy lifestyle. There were no significant differences between groups for any outcomes. Participants across both groups showed significant improvements with moderate effect sizes in compensatory strategy use, anxiety symptoms, and daily functioning, which were sustained through 6-month follow-up. They also increased physical activity by the end of the intervention period but did not sustain this through 6-month follow-up. Our pilot study demonstrates preliminary feasibility of a cognitive compensatory and lifestyle-based brain health program. Additional research is recommended to further develop two potentially scalable implementation strategies—coaching and self-implementation after brief consultation.</p>
