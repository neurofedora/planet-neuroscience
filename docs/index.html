<p>Recent transcranial magnetic stimulation research indicated that the ability of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to disinhibit the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) during motor preparation is an important predictor for bimanual motor performance in both young and older healthy adults. However, this DLPFC-M1 disinhibition is reduced in older adults. Here, we transiently suppressed left DLPFC using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during a cyclical bimanual task and investigated the effect of left DLPFC suppression (1) on the projection from left DLPFC to the contralateral M1 and (2) on motor performance in 21 young (mean age ± SD = 21.57 ± 1.83) and 20 older (mean age ± SD = 69.05 ± 4.48) healthy adults. As predicted, without rTMS, older adults showed a compromised DLPFC-M1 disinhibition as compared to younger adults and less preparatory DLPFC-M1 disinhibition was related to less accurate performance, irrespective of age. Notably, rTMS-induced DLPFC suppression restored DLPFC-M1 disinhibition in older adults and improved performance accuracy right after the local suppression in both age groups. However, the rTMS-induced gain in disinhibition was not correlated with the gain in performance. In sum, this novel rTMS approach advanced our mechanistic understanding of how left DLPFC regulates right M1 and allowed us to establish the causal role of left DLPFC in bimanual coordination.</p>

<p>Cognitive states are involving in our daily life, which motivates us to
explore them and understand them by a vast variety of perspectives. Among these
perspectives, brain connectivity is increasingly receiving attention in recent
years. It is the right time to summarize the past achievements, serving as a
cornerstone for the upcoming progress in the field. In this chapter, the
definition of the cognitive state is first given and the cognitive states that
are frequently investigated are then outlined. The introduction of approaches
for estimating connectivity strength is followed. Subsequently, each cognitive
state is separately described and the progress in cognitive state investigation
is summarized, including analysis, understanding, and decoding. We concentrate
on the literature ascertaining macro-scale representations of cognitive states
from the perspective of brain connectivity and give an overview of achievements
related to cognitive states to date, especially within the past ten years. The
discussions and future prospects are stated at the end of the chapter.

<p>The mapping between the visual input on the retina to the cortical surface,
i.e., retinotopic mapping, is an important topic in vision science and
neuroscience. Human retinotopic mapping can be revealed by analyzing cortex
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals when the subject is under
specific visual stimuli. Conventional methods process, smooth, and analyze the
retinotopic mapping based on the parametrization of the (partial) cortical
surface. However, the retinotopic maps generated by this approach frequently
contradict neuropsychology results. To address this problem, we propose an
integrated approach that parameterizes the cortical surface, such that the
parametric coordinates linearly relates the visual coordinate. The proposed
method helps the smoothing of noisy retinotopic maps and obtains
neurophysiological insights in human vision systems. One key element of the
approach is the Error-Tolerant Teichmuller Map, which uniforms the angle
distortion and maximizes the alignments to self-contradicting landmarks. We
validated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping
datasets. The experimental results show the proposed approach is superior in
accuracy and compatibility. Although we focus on retinotopic mapping, the
proposed framework is general and can be applied to process other human sensory
maps.

<p>This paper discusses an approach for incorporating prior physical knowledge
into the neural network to improve data efficiency and the generalization of
predictive models. If the dynamics of a system approximately follows a given
differential equation, the Taylor mapping method can be used to initialize the
weights of a polynomial neural network. This allows the fine-tuning of the
model from one training sample of real system dynamics. The paper describes
practical results on real experiments with both a simple pendulum and one of
the largest worldwide X-ray source. It is demonstrated in practice that the
proposed approach allows recovering complex physics from noisy, limited, and
partial observations and provides meaningful predictions for previously unseen
inputs. The approach mainly targets the learning of physical systems when
state-of-the-art models are difficult to apply given the lack of training data.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11689">Derivation of Symmetric PCA Learning Rules from a Novel Objective Function. (arXiv:2005.11689v1 [math.OC])</a></h4>

<p>Neural learning rules for principal component / subspace analysis (PCA / PSA)
can be derived by maximizing an objective function (summed variance of the
projection on the subspace axes) under an orthonormality constraint. For a
subspace with a single axis, the optimization produces the principal
eigenvector of the data covariance matrix. Hierarchical learning rules with
deflation procedures can then be used to extract multiple eigenvectors.
However, for a subspace with multiple axes, the optimization leads to PSA
learning rules which only converge to axes spanning the principal subspace but
not to the principal eigenvectors. A modified objective function with distinct
weight factors had to be introduced produce PCA learning rules. Optimization of
the objective function for multiple axes leads to symmetric learning rules
which do not require deflation procedures. For the PCA case, the estimated
principal eigenvectors are ordered (w.r.t. the corresponding eigenvalues)
depending on the order of the weight factors.
</p>
<p>Here we introduce an alternative objective function where it is not necessary
to introduce fixed weight factors; instead, the alternative objective function
uses squared summands. Optimization leads to symmetric PCA learning rules which
converge to the principal eigenvectors, but without imposing an order. In place
of the diagonal matrices with fixed weight factors, variable diagonal matrices
appear in the learning rules. We analyze this alternative approach by
determining the fixed points of the constrained optimization. The behavior of
the constrained objective function at the fixed points is analyzed which
confirms both the PCA behavior and the fact that no order is imposed. Different
ways to derive learning rules from the optimization of the objective function
are presented. The role of the terms in the learning rules obtained from these
derivations is explored.

<p>The emergence of brain-inspired neuromorphic computing as a paradigm for edge
AI is motivating the search for high-performance and efficient spiking neural
networks to run on this hardware. However, compared to classical neural
networks in deep learning, current spiking neural networks lack competitive
performance in compelling areas. Here, for sequential and streaming tasks, we
demonstrate how a novel type of adaptive spiking recurrent neural network
(SRNN) is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other
spiking neural networks and almost reach or exceed the performance of classical
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while exhibiting sparse activity. From this,
we calculate a $&gt;$100x energy improvement for our SRNNs over classical RNNs on
the harder tasks. To achieve this, we model standard and adaptive
multiple-timescale spiking neurons as self-recurrent neural units, and leverage
surrogate gradients and auto-differentiation in the PyTorch Deep Learning
framework to efficiently implement backpropagation-through-time, including
learning of the important spiking neuron parameters to adapt our spiking
neurons to the tasks.

<p>Biological neural networks have evolved to maintain performance despite
significant circuit damage. To survive damage, biological network architectures
have both intrinsic resilience to component loss and also activate recovery
programs that adjust network weights through plasticity to stabilize
performance. Despite the importance of resilience in technology applications,
the resilience of artificial neural networks is poorly understood, and
autonomous recovery algorithms have yet to be developed. In this paper, we
establish a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of artificial
neural networks through the lens of differential geometry. Our geometric
language provides natural algorithms that identify local vulnerabilities in
trained networks as well as recovery algorithms that dynamically adjust
networks to compensate for damage. We reveal striking vulnerabilities in
commonly used image analysis networks, like MLP's and CNN's trained on MNIST
and CIFAR10 respectively. We also uncover high-performance recovery paths that
enable the same networks to dynamically re-adjust their parameters to
compensate for damage. Broadly, our work provides procedures that endow
artificial systems with resilience and rapid-recovery routines to enhance their
integration with IoT devices as well as enable their deployment for critical
applications.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11600">Knee Point Identification Based on Trade-Off Utility. (arXiv:2005.11600v1 [math.OC])</a></h4>

<p>Knee points, characterised as their smallest trade-off loss at all
objectives, are attractive to decision makers in multi-criterion
decision-making. In contrast, other Pareto-optimal solutions are less
attractive since a small improvement on one objective can lead to a significant
degradation on at least one of the other objectives. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective knee point identification method based on trade-off
utility, dubbed KPITU, to help decision makers identify knee points from a
given set of trade-off solutions. The basic idea of KPITU is to sequentially
validate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its trade-off
utility with others within its neighbourhood. In particular, a solution is a
knee point if and only if it has the best trade-off utility among its
neighbours. Moreover, we implement a GPU version of KPITU that carries out the
knee point identification in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the
worst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. To validate the effectiveness
of KPITU, we compare its performance with five state-of-the-art knee point
identification methods on 134 test problem instances. Empirical results fully
demonstrate the outstanding performance of KPITU especially on problems with
many local knee points. At the end, we further validate the usefulness of KPITU
for guiding EMO algorithms to search for knee points on the fly during the
evolutionary process.

<p>The complexity of cooperative behavior is a crucial issue in multiagent-based
social simulation. In this paper, an agent-based model is proposed to study the
evolution of cooperative hunting behaviors in an artificial society. In this
model, the standard hunting game of stag is modified into a new situation with
social hierarchy and penalty. The agent society is divided into multiple layers
with supervisors and subordinates. In each layer, the society is divided into
multiple clusters. A supervisor controls all subordinates in a cluster locally.
Subordinates in a cluster interact with each other through reinforcement
learning, and report learning information to their corresponding supervisor.
Supervisors process the reported information through repeated affiliation-based
aggregation and by information exchange with other supervisors, then pass down
the reprocessed information to subordinates as guidance. Subordinates, in turn,
update learning information according to guidance, following the win stay, lose
shift strategy. Experiments are carried out to test the evolution of
cooperation in this closed-loop semi-supervised emergent system with different
parameters. We also study the variations and phase transitions in this game
setting.

<p>As an optical machine learning framework, Diffractive Deep Neural Networks
(D2NN) take advantage of data-driven training methods used in deep learning to
devise light-matter interaction in 3D for performing a desired statistical
inference task. Multi-layer optical object recognition platforms designed with
this diffractive framework have been shown to generalize to unseen image data
achieving e.g., &gt;98% blind inference accuracy for hand-written digit
classification. The multi-layer structure of diffractive networks offers
significant advantages in terms of their diffraction efficiency, inference
capability and optical signal contrast. However, the use of multiple
diffractive layers also brings practical challenges for the fabrication and
alignment of these diffractive systems for accurate optical inference. Here, we
introduce and experimentally demonstrate a new training scheme that
significantly increases the robustness of diffractive networks against 3D
misalignments and fabrication tolerances in the physical implementation of a
trained diffractive network. By modeling the undesired layer-to-layer
misalignments in 3D as continuous random variables in the optical forward
model, diffractive networks are trained to maintain their inference accuracy
over a large range of misalignments; we term this diffractive network design as
vaccinated D2NN (v-D2NN). We further extend this vaccination strategy to the
training of diffractive networks that use differential detectors at the output
plane as well as to jointly-trained hybrid (optical-electronic) networks to
reveal that all of these diffractive designs improve their resilience to
misalignments by taking into account possible 3D fabrication variations and
displacements during their training phase.

<p>Machine vision systems mostly rely on lens-based optical imaging
architectures that relay the spatial information of objects onto high
pixel-count opto-electronic sensor arrays, followed by digital processing of
this information. Here, we demonstrate an optical machine vision system that
uses trainable matter in the form of diffractive layers to transform and encode
the spatial information of objects into the power spectrum of the diffracted
light, which is used to perform optical classification of objects with a
single-pixel spectroscopic detector. Using a time-domain spectroscopy setup
with a plasmonic nanoantenna-based detector, we experimentally validated this
framework at terahertz spectrum to optically classify the images of handwritten
digits by detecting the spectral power of the diffracted light at ten distinct
wavelengths, each representing one class/digit. We also report the coupling of
this spectral encoding achieved through a diffractive optical network with a
shallow electronic neural network, separately trained to reconstruct the images
of handwritten digits based on solely the spectral information encoded in these
ten distinct wavelengths within the diffracted light. These reconstructed
images demonstrate task-specific image decompression and can also be cycled
back as new inputs to the same diffractive network to improve its optical
object classification. This unique framework merges the power of deep learning
with the spatial and spectral processing capabilities of trainable matter, and
can also be extended to other spectral-domain measurement systems to enable new
3D imaging and sensing modalities integrated with spectrally encoded
classification tasks performed through diffractive networks.

<p>This paper presents a new framework to use images as the inputs for the
controller to have autonomous flight, considering the noisy indoor environment
and uncertainties. A new Proportional-Integral-Derivative-Accelerated (PIDA)
control with a derivative filter is proposed to improves drone/quadcopter
flight stability within a noisy environment and enables autonomous flight using
object and depth detection techniques. The mathematical model is derived from
an accurate model with a high level of fidelity by addressing the problems of
non-linearity, uncertainties, and coupling. The proposed PIDA controller is
tuned by Stochastic Dual Simplex Algorithm (SDSA) to support autonomous flight.
The simulation results show that adapting the deep learning-based image
understanding techniques (RetinaNet ant colony detection and PSMNet) to the
proposed controller can enable the generation and tracking of the desired point
in the presence of environmental disturbances.

<p>Most causal discovery algorithms find causal structure among a set of
observed variables. Learning the causal structure among latent variables
remains an important open problem, particularly when using high-dimensional
data. In this paper, we address a problem for which it is known that inputs
cause outputs, and these causal relationships are encoded by a causal network
among a set of an unknown number of latent variables. We developed a deep
learning model, which we call a redundant input neural network (RINN), with a
modified architecture and a regularized objective function to find causal
relationships between input, hidden, and output variables. More specifically,
our model allows input variables to directly interact with all latent variables
in a neural network to influence what information the latent variables should
encode in order to generate the output variables accurately. In this setting,
the direct connections between input and latent variables makes the latent
variables partially interpretable; furthermore, the connectivity among the
latent variables in the neural network serves to model their potential causal
relationships to each other and to the output variables. A series of simulation
experiments provide support that the RINN method can successfully recover
latent causal structure between input and output variables.

<p>The interaction of a gas particle with a metal-oxide based gas sensor changes
the sensor irreversibly. The compounded changes, referred to as sensor drift,
are unstable, but adaptive algorithms can sustain the accuracy of odor sensor
systems. This paper shows how such a system can be defined without additional
data acquisition by transfering knowledge from one time window to a subsequent
one after drift has occurred. A context-based neural network model is used to
form a latent representation of sensor state, thus making it possible to
generalize across a sequence of states. When tested on samples from unseen
subsequent time windows, the approach performed better than drift-naive and
ensemble methods on a gas sensor array drift dataset. By reducing the effect
that sensor drift has on classification accuracy, context-based models may be
used to extend the effective lifetime of gas identification systems in
practical settings.

<p>Many real-world problems are categorized as large-scale problems, and
metaheuristic algorithms as an alternative method to solve large-scale problem;
they need the evaluation of many candidate solutions to tackle them prior to
their convergence, which is not affordable for practical applications since the
most of them are computationally expensive. There is no efficient surrogate
model to support large-scale expensive global optimization (LSEGO) problems. As
a result, the algorithms should address LSEGO problems using a limited
computational budget to be applicable in real-world applications. Coordinate
Descent (CD) algorithm is an optimization strategy based on the decomposition
of a n-dimensional problem into n one-dimensional problem. To the best our
knowledge, there is no significant study to assess benchmark functions with
various dimensions and landscape properties to investigate CD algorithm and
compare with other metaheuristic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a
modified Coordinate Descent algorithm (MCD) to tackle LSEGO problems with a
limited computational budget. Our proposed algorithm benefits from two leading
steps, namely, finding the region of interest and then shrinkage of the search
space by folding it into the half with exponential speed. One of the main
advantages of the proposed algorithm is being free of any control parameters,
which makes it far from the intricacies of the tuning process. The proposed
algorithm is compared with cooperative co-evolution with delta grouping on 20
benchmark functions with dimension 1000. Also, we conducted some experiments on
CEC-2017 to investigate the behavior of MCD algorithm in lower dimensions. The
results show that MCD is beneficial not only in large-scale problems, but also
in low-scale optimization problems.

<p>In this article, we highlight what appears to be major issue of Variational
Autoencoders, evinced from an extensive experimentation with different network
architectures and datasets: the variance of generated data is significantly
lower than that of training data. Since generative models are usually evaluated
with metrics such as the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) that compare the
distributions of (features of) real versus generated images, the variance loss
typically results in degraded scores. This problem is particularly relevant in
a two stage setting, where we use a second VAE to sample in the latent space of
the first VAE. The minor variance creates a mismatch between the actual
distribution of latent variables and those generated by the second VAE, that
hinders the beneficial effects of the second stage. Renormalizing the output of
the second VAE towards the expected normal spherical distribution, we obtain a
sudden burst in the quality of generated samples, as also testified in terms of
FID.

<p>Model structure and complexity selection remains a challenging problem in
system identification, especially for parametric non-linear models. Many
Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) based methods have been proposed in the literature
for estimating model structure and complexity. In most cases, the proposed
methods are devised for estimating structure and complexity within a specified
model class and hence these methods do not extend to other model structures
without significant changes. In this paper, we propose a Tree Adjoining Grammar
(TAG) for stochastic parametric models. TAGs can be used to generate models in
an EA framework while imposing desirable structural constraints and
incorporating prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a TAG that can
systematically generate models ranging from FIRs to polynomial NARMAX models.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that TAGs can be easily extended to more general
model classes, such as the non-linear Box-Jenkins model class, enabling the
realization of flexible and automatic model structure and complexity selection
via EA.

<p>Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is dependent upon
a subjective, time-consuming evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert
clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity
and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However,
successful construction of deep learning models from fMRI requires addressing
key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and
number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC)
features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of
granularity. Once a model has been built, it is vital to determine which
features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas
granularity levels. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations,
probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing
models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity
features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important
features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the
highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per
layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important
across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor
gyrus and language association cortex, regions associated with deficits in
social and sensory processing in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not
included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal
connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify
important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the
selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of
granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.

the different layers of the visual pathway?. Separate subsystems (e.g. opponent
channels, spatial filters, nonlinearities of the texture sensors) have been
suggested to be organized for optimal information transmission. However, the
efficiency of these different layers has not been measured when they operate
together on colorimetrically calibrated natural images and using multivariate
information-theoretic units over the joint spatio-chromatic array of responses.
</p>
<p>In this work we present a statistical tool to address this question in an
appropriate (multivariate) way. Specifically, we propose an empirical estimate
of the information transmitted by the system based on a recent Gaussianization
technique that reduces the challenging multivariate PDF estimation problem to a
set of simpler univariate estimations. Total correlation measured using the
proposed estimator is consistent with predictions based on the analytical
Jacobian of a standard spatio-chromatic model of the retina-cortex pathway. If
the noise at certain representation is proportional to the dynamic range of the
response, and one assumes sensors of equivalent noise level, transmitted
information shows the following trends: (1) progressively deeper
representations are better in terms of the amount of information about the
input, (2) the transmitted information up to the cortical representation
follows the PDF of natural scenes over the chromatic and achromatic dimensions
of the stimulus space, (3) the contribution of spatial transforms to capture
visual information is substantially bigger than the contribution of chromatic
transforms, and (4) nonlinearities of the responses contribute substantially to
the transmitted information but less than the linear transforms.

<p>The possibility to use competitive evolutionary algorithms to generate
long-term progress is normally prevented by the convergence on limit cycle
dynamics in which the evolving agents keep progressing against their current
competitors by periodically rediscovering solutions adopted previously over and
over again. This leads to local but not to global progress, i.e. progress
against all possible competitors. We propose a new competitive algorithm that
produces long-term global progress by identifying and by filtering out
opportunistic variations, i.e. variations leading to progress against current
competitors and retrogression against other competitors. The efficacy of the
method is validated on the co-evolution of predator and prey robots, a classic
problem that has been used in other related researches. The accumulation of
global progress over many generations leads to effective solutions that involve
the production of rather articulated behaviors. The complexity of the behavior
displayed by the evolving robots increases across generations although
progresses in performance are not always accompanied by behavior
complexification.

<p>We present DRLViz, a visual analytics interface to interpret the internal
memory of an agent (e.g. a robot) trained using deep reinforcement learning.
This memory is composed of large temporal vectors updated when the agent moves
in an environment and is not trivial to understand due to the number of
dimensions, dependencies to past vectors, spatial/temporal correlations, and
co-correlation between dimensions. It is often referred to as a black box as
only inputs (images) and outputs (actions) are intelligible for humans. Using
DRLViz, experts are assisted to interpret decisions using memory reduction
interactions, and to investigate the role of parts of the memory when errors
have been made (e.g. wrong direction). We report on DRLViz applied in the
context of video games simulators (ViZDoom) for a navigation scenario with item
gathering tasks. We also report on experts evaluation using DRLViz, and
applicability of DRLViz to other scenarios and navigation problems beyond
simulation games, as well as its contribution to black box models
interpretability and explainability in the field of visual analytics.

<p>We study how the behavior of deep policy gradient algorithms reflects the
conceptual framework motivating their development. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained analysis of state-of-the-art methods based on key elements of this
framework: gradient estimation, value prediction, and optimization landscapes.
Our results show that the behavior of deep policy gradient algorithms often
deviates from what their motivating framework would predict: the surrogate
objective does not match the true reward landscape, learned value estimators
fail to fit the true value function, and gradient estimates poorly correlate
with the "true" gradient. The mismatch between predicted and empirical behavior
we uncover highlights our poor understanding of current methods, and indicates
the need to move beyond current benchmark-centric evaluation methods.

<p>We consider learning deep neural networks (DNNs) that consist of
low-precision weights and activations for efficient inference of fixed-point
operations. In training low-precision networks, gradient descent in the
backward pass is performed with high-precision weights while quantized
low-precision weights and activations are used in the forward pass to calculate
the loss function for training. Thus, the gradient descent becomes suboptimal,
and accuracy loss follows. In order to reduce the mismatch in the forward and
backward passes, we utilize mean squared quantization error (MSQE)
regularization. In particular, we propose using a learnable regularization
coefficient with the MSQE regularizer to reinforce the convergence of
high-precision weights to their quantized values. We also investigate how
partial L2 regularization can be employed for weight pruning in a similar
manner. Finally, combining weight pruning, quantization, and entropy coding, we
establish a low-precision DNN compression pipeline. In our experiments, the
proposed method yields low-precision MobileNet and ShuffleNet models on
ImageNet classification with the state-of-the-art compression ratios of 7.13
and 6.79, respectively. Moreover, we examine our method for image super
resolution networks to produce 8-bit low-precision models at negligible
performance loss.

<p>In this work we explore emergent encoding strategies learned by statistical
models of sensory coding in noisy spiking networks. Early stages of sensory
communication in neural systems can be viewed as encoding channels in the
information-theoretic sense. However, spiking neural populations face
constraints not commonly considered in communications theory. Using Restricted
Boltzmann machines, we find that networks with sufficient capacity learn to
balance precision and noise-robustness in order to adaptively communicate
stimuli with varying information content. Mirroring variability suppression
observed in sensory systems, highly informative stimuli are encoded with high
precision, at the cost of highly variable responses to frequent, hence less
informative stimuli. We find that this coding strategy corresponds to
statistical criticality in the neural population code, and emerges at model
sizes where the input statistics are well captured. These phenomena have
well-defined thermodynamic interpretations, and we discuss their connection to
prevailing theories of coding and statistical criticality in neural
populations.

<p>Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in
optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic
approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN based patch matching approach for
optical flow estimation. An important contribution of our approach is a novel
thresholded loss for Siamese networks. We demonstrate that our loss performs
clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a
factor of 2 in our tests. Furthermore, we present a novel way for calculating
CNN based features for different image scales, which performs better than
existing methods. We also discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of
trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An
interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps
can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the
competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012,
KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art
results on all three datasets.

<p>Exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, during the critical period of synaptogenesis, causes profound neurotoxicity in the developing rodent and primate brains and is associated with poor cognitive outcomes later in life. The subiculum is especially vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity after neonatal exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs. The subiculum acts as a relay center between the hippocampal complex and various cortical and subcortical brain regions and is also an independent generator of gamma oscillations. Gamma oscillations are vital in neuronal synchronization and play a role in learning and memory during wake and sleep. However, there has been little research examining long-term changes in subicular neurophysiology after neonatal exposure to ketamine. Here we explore the lasting effects of neonatal ketamine exposure on sleep macrostructure as well as subicular neuronal oscillations and synaptic plasticity in rats. During the peak of rodent synaptogenesis at postnatal day 7, rat pups were exposed to either 40 mg/kg of ketamine over 12 h or to volume matched saline vehicle. At weaning age, a subset of rats were implanted with a cortical and subicular electroencephalogram electrode, and at postnatal day 31, we performed in vivo experiments that included sleep macrostructure (divided into the wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra in cortex and subiculum. In a second subset of ketamine exposed animals, we conducted ex vivo studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in adolescent rats. Overall, we found that neonatal exposure to ketamine increased subicular gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep but it did not alter sleep macrostructure. Also, we observed a significant decrease in subicular LTP. Gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep are implicated in memory formation and consolidation, while LTP serves as a surrogate for learning and memory. Together these results suggest that lasting functional changes in subiculum circuitry may underlie neurocognitive impairments associated with neonatal exposure to anesthetic agents.</p>

<p>Changes in excitation and inhibition are associated with the pathobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual disability and autism and are widely described in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), essential for cognitive processing, excitatory connectivity and plasticity are found altered in the FXS mouse model, however, little is known about the state of inhibition. To that end, we investigated GABAergic signaling in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) knock out (Fmr1-KO) mouse medial PFC (mPFC). We report changes at the molecular, and functional levels of inhibition at three (prepubescence) and six (adolescence) postnatal weeks. Functional changes were most prominent during early postnatal development, resulting in stronger inhibition, through increased synaptic inhibitory drive and amplitude, and reduction of inhibitory short-term synaptic depression. Noise analysis of prepubescent post-synaptic currents demonstrated an increased number of receptors opening during peak current in Fmr1-KO inhibitory synapses. During adolescence amplitudes and plasticity changes normalized, however, the inhibitory drive was now reduced in Fmr1-KO, while synaptic kinetics were prolonged. Finally, adolescent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit α2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtype B1 expression levels were different in Fmr1-KOs than WT littermate controls. Together these results extend the degree of synaptic GABAergic alterations in FXS, now to the mPFC of Fmr1-KO mice, a behaviourally relevant brain region in neurodevelopmental disorder pathology.</p>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowed the spatial characterization of the resting-state verbal language network (vLN). While other resting-state networks (RSNs) were matched with their electrophysiological equivalents at rest and could be spectrally defined, such correspondence is lacking for the vLN. This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study aimed at defining the spatio-spectral characteristics of the neuromagnetic intrinsic functional architecture of the vLN. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded at rest in 100 right-handed healthy adults (age range: 18–41 years). Band-limited power envelope correlations were performed within and across frequency bands (θ, α, β, and low γ) from a seed region placed in the left Broca’s area, using static orthogonalization as leakage correction. K-means clustering was used to segregate spatio-spectral clusters of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Remarkably, unlike other RSNs, within-frequency long-range rsFC from the left Broca’s area was not driven by one main carrying frequency but was characterized by a specific spatio-spectral pattern segregated along the ventral (predominantly θ and α) and dorsal (β and low-γ bands) vLN streams. In contrast, spatial patterns of cross-frequency vLN functional integration were spectrally more widespread and involved multiple frequency bands. Moreover, the static intrinsic functional architecture of the neuromagnetic human vLN involved clearly left-hemisphere-dominant vLN interactions as well as cross-network interactions with the executive control network and postero-medial nodes of the DMN. Overall, this study highlighted the involvement of multiple modes of within and cross-frequency power envelope couplings at the basis of long-range electrophysiological vLN functional integration. As such, it lays the foundation for future works aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of language-related disorders.</p>

<p>It may seem useless to propose preventive measures for a disease without established pathogenesis and successful therapy, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, we will show that ALS shares essential molecular mechanisms with aging and that established anti-aging strategies, such as healthy diet or individually adjusted exercise, may be successfully applied to ameliorate the condition of ALS patients. These strategies might be applied for prevention if persons at ALS risk could be identified early enough. Recent research advances indicate that this may happen soon.</p>

<p>The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.</p>

<p>Background: Achieving clear visibility through a windshield is one of the crucial factors in manufacturing a safe and comfortable vehicle. The optic flow (OF) through the windshield has been reported to divert attention and could impair visibility. Although a growing number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have assessed drivers’ attention in various driving scenarios, there is still little evidence of a relationship between OF, windshield shape, and driver’s attentional efficacy. The purpose of this research was to examine this relationship.</p><p>Methods: First, we quantified the OF across the windshield in a simulated driving scenario with either of two types of the windshield (a tilted or vertical pillar) at different speeds (60 km/h or 160 km/h) and found more upward OF along the tilted pillar than along the vertical pillar. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominance of upward OF around the windshield along a tilted pillar could distract a driver and that we could observe the corresponding neural activity. Magnetic resonance scans were then obtained while the subjects performed a visual detection task while watching the driving scene used in the OF analysis. The subjects were required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a target appeared at one of five positions (leftmost, left, center, right, and rightmost).</p><p>Results: We found that the reaction time (RT) on exposure to a tilted pillar was longer than that on exposure to a vertical pillar in the leftmost and rightmost conditions. Furthermore, there was more brain activity in the precuneus when the pillar was tilted than when it was vertical in the rightmost condition near the pillar. In a separate analysis, activation in the precuneus was found to reflect relative changes in the amount of upward OF when the target was at the rightmost position.</p><p>Conclusions: Overall, these observations suggest that activation in the precuneus may reflect extraneous cognitive load driven by upward OF along the pillar and could distract visual attention. The findings of this study highlight the value of a cognitive neuroscientific approach to research and development in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>Sensorimotor communication is a form of communication instantiated through body movements that are guided by both instrumental, goal-directed intentions and communicative, social intentions. Depending on the social interaction context, sensorimotor communication can serve different functions. This article aims to disentangle three of these functions: (a) an informing function of body movements, to highlight action intentions for an observer; (b) a coordinating function of body movements, to facilitate real-time action prediction in joint action; and (c) a performing function of body movements, to elicit emotional or aesthetic experiences in an audience. We provide examples of research addressing these different functions as well as some influencing factors, relating to individual differences, task characteristics, and situational demands. The article concludes by discussing the benefits of a closer dialog between separate lines of research on sensorimotor communication across different social contexts.</p>

<p>There is debate in the literature regarding how single-digit arithmetic fluency is achieved over development. While the Fact-retrieval hypothesis suggests that with practice, children shift from quantity-based procedures to verbally retrieving arithmetic problems from long-term memory, the Schema-based hypothesis claims that problems are solved through quantity-based procedures and that practice leads to these procedures becoming more automatic. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 46 typically developing children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when they were 11 years old (time 1), and 2 years later (time 2). We independently defined regions of interest (ROIs) involved in verbal and quantity processing using rhyming and numerosity judgment localizer tasks, respectively. The verbal ROIs consisted of left middle/superior temporal gyri (MTG/STG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), whereas the quantity ROIs consisted of bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobules (IPL/SPL) and bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG)/right IFG. Participants also solved a single-digit subtraction task in the scanner. We defined the extent to which children relied on verbal vs. quantity mechanisms by selecting the 100 voxels showing maximal activation at time 1 from each ROI, separately for small and large subtractions. We studied the brain mechanisms at time 1 that predicted gains in subtraction fluency and how these mechanisms changed over time with improvement. When looking at brain activation at time 1, we found that improvers showed a larger neural problem size effect in bilateral parietal cortex, whereas no effects were found in verbal regions. Results also revealed that children who showed improvement in behavioral fluency for large subtraction problems showed decreased activation over time for large subtractions in both parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity, whereas non-improvers maintained similar levels of activation. All children, regardless of improvement, showed decreased activation over time for large subtraction problems in verbal regions. The greater parietal problem size effect at time 1 and the reduction in activation over time for the improvers in parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity processing is consistent with the Schema-based hypothesis arguing for more automatic procedures with increasing skill. The lack of a problem size effect at time 1 and the overall decrease in verbal regions, regardless of improvement, is inconsistent with the Fact-retrieval hypothesis.</p>

<p>Comprehending how the brain functions requires an understanding of the dynamics of neuronal assemblies. Previous work used a mean-field reduction method to determine the collective dynamics of a large heterogeneous network of uniformly and globally coupled theta neurons, which are a canonical formulation of Type I neurons. However, in modeling neuronal networks, it is unreasonable to assume that the coupling strength between every pair of neurons is identical. The goal in the present work is to analytically examine the collective macroscopic behavior of a network of theta neurons that is more realistic in that it includes heterogeneity in the coupling strength as well as in neuronal excitability. We consider the occurrence of dynamical structures that give rise to complicated dynamics via bifurcations of macroscopic collective quantities, concentrating on two biophysically relevant cases: (1) predominantly excitable neurons with mostly excitatory connections, and (2) predominantly spiking neurons with inhibitory connections. We find that increasing the synaptic diversity moves these dynamical structures to distant extremes of parameter space, leaving simple collective equilibrium states in the physiologically relevant region. We also study the node vs. focus nature of stable macroscopic equilibrium solutions and discuss our results in the context of recent literature.</p>

<p>The responses of many cortical neurons to visual stimuli are modulated by the position of the eye. This form of gain modulation by eye position does not change the retinotopic selectivity of the responses, but only changes the amplitude of the responses. Particularly in the case of cortical responses, this form of eye position gain modulation has been observed to be multiplicative. Multiplicative gain modulated responses are crucial to encode information that is relevant to high-level visual functions, such as stable spatial awareness, eye movement planning, visual-motor behaviors, and coordinate transformation. Here we first present a hardwired model of different functional forms of gain modulation, including peaked and monotonic modulation by eye position. We use a biologically realistic Gaussian function to model the influence of the position of the eye on the internal activation of visual neurons. Next we show how different functional forms of gain modulation by eye position may develop in a self-organizing neural network model of visual neurons. A further contribution of our work is the investigation of the influence of the width of the eye position tuning curve on the development of a variety of forms of eye position gain modulation. Our simulation results show how the width of the eye position tuning curve affects the development of different forms of gain modulation of visual responses by the position of the eye.</p>

<p>The search for drugs that can facilitate axonal regeneration and elongation following peripheral nerve injury has been an area of increasing interest in recent years. Epothilone B (EpoB) is an FDA-approved antineoplastic agent, which shows the capacity to induce α-tubulin polymerization and to improve the stability of microtubules. Recently, it has been increasingly recognized that EpoB has a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. However, the information currently available regarding the potential therapeutic effect of EpoB on peripheral nerve regeneration is limited. Here, we used a rat sciatic crush injury model system to determine that EpoB strikingly improved axonal regeneration and recovery of function. Also, EpoB (1 nM) did not result in significant apoptosis in Schwann cells (SCs) and showed little effect on their viability either. Interestingly, EpoB (1 nM) significantly enhanced migration in SCs, which was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Since PI3K/Akt signaling has been implicated in regulating autophagy, we further examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt in the process of EpoB-induced SC migration. We found that EpoB (1 nM) significantly inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in SCs. Further studies showed that both EpoB-enhanced migration and autophagy were increased/inhibited by inhibition/activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with LY294002 or IGF-1. In conclusion, EpoB can promote axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury by enhancing the migration of SCs, with this activity being controlled by PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated autophagy in SCs. This underscores the potential therapeutic value of EpoB in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in cases of peripheral nerve injury.</p>

<p>Embryonic exposure to the teratogen nicotine results in brain defects, by disrupting endogenous spatial pre patterns necessary for normal brain size and patterning. Extending prior work in Xenopus laevis that showed that misexpression of ion channels can rescue morphogenesis, we demonstrate and characterize a novel aspect of developmental bioelectricity: channel-dependent repair signals propagate long-range across the embryo. We show that distal HCN2 channel misexpression and distal transplants of HCN2-expressing tissue, non-cell-autonomously reverse profound defects, rescuing brain anatomy, gene expression, and learning. Moreover, such rescue can be induced by small-molecule HCN2 channel activators, even with delayed treatment initiation. We present a simple, versatile computational model of bioelectrical signaling upstream of key patterning genes such as OTX2 and XBF1, which predicts long-range repair induced by ion channel activity, and experimentally validate the predictions of this model. Our results and quantitative model identify a powerful morphogenetic control mechanism that could be targeted by future regenerative medicine exploiting ion channel modulating drugs approved for human use.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to explore functional and structural properties of abnormal brain networks associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET) and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 20 patients with moderate-stage PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were acquired to identify disease-related patterns in functional and structural networks. Dual-modal images from another prospective subject of 15 PD patients were used as the validation group. Scaled Subprofile Modeling based on principal component analysis method was applied to determine disease-related patterns in both modalities, and brain connectome analysis based on graph theory was applied to verify these patterns. The results showed that the expressions of the metabolic and structural patterns in PD patients were significantly higher than healthy controls (PD1-HC, p = 0.0039, p = 0.0058; PD2-HC, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.044). The metabolic pattern was characterized by relative increased metabolic activity in pallidothalamic, pons, putamen, and cerebellum, associated with metabolic decreased in parietal–occipital areas. The structural pattern was characterized by relative decreased gray matter (GM) volume in pons, transverse temporal gyrus, left cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule, associated with preservation in GM volume in pallidum and putamen. In addition, both patterns were verified in the connectome analysis. The findings suggest that significant overlaps between metabolic and structural patterns provide new evidence for elucidating the neuropathological mechanisms of PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58603">SARS-CoV-2 strategically mimics proteolytic activation of human ENaC</a></h4>

Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (ENaC-α). Genetic alteration of ENaC-α causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-α and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-α, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57822">TANGO1 membrane helices create a lipid diffusion barrier at curved membranes</a></h4>

We have previously shown TANGO1 organises membranes at the interface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ERGIC/Golgi (Raote et al., 2018). TANGO1 corrals retrograde membranes at ER exit sites to create an export conduit. Here the retrograde membrane is, in itself, an anterograde carrier. This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape. We have also shown that the helices align TANGO1 around an ER exit site. We suggest this is a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing during TANGO1-mediated transfer of bulky secretory cargos from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi via a tunnel.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57578">A molecular filter for the cnidarian stinging response</a></h4>

All animals detect and integrate diverse environmental signals to mediate behavior. Cnidarians, including jellyfish and sea anemones, both detect and capture prey using stinging cells called nematocytes which fire a venom-covered barb via an unknown triggering mechanism. Here, we show that nematocytes from <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> use a specialized voltage-gated calcium channel (nCa<sub>V</sub>) to distinguish salient sensory cues and control the explosive discharge response. Adaptations in nCa<sub>V</sub> confer unusually sensitive, voltage-dependent inactivation to inhibit responses to non-prey signals, such as mechanical water turbulence. Prey-derived chemosensory signals are synaptically transmitted to acutely relieve nCa<sub>V</sub> inactivation, enabling mechanosensitive-triggered predatory attack. These findings reveal a molecular basis for the cnidarian stinging response and highlight general principles by which single proteins integrate diverse signals to elicit discrete animal behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57410">Signaling diversity enabled by Rap1-regulated plasma membrane ERK with distinct temporal dynamics</a></h4>

A variety of different signals induce specific responses through a common, Extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent cascade. It has been suggested that signaling specificity can be achieved through precise temporal regulation of ERK activity. Given the wide distrubtion of ERK susbtrates across different subcellular compartments, it is important to understand how ERK activity is temporally regulated at specific subcellular locations. To address this question, we have expanded the toolbox of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based ERK biosensors by creating a series of improved biosensors targeted to various subcellular regions via sequence specific motifs to measure spatiotemporal changes in ERK activity. Using these sensors, we showed that EGF induces sustained ERK activity near the plasma membrane in sharp contrast to the transient activity observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, EGF-induced plasma membrane ERK activity involves Rap1, a noncanonical activator, and controls cell morphology and EGF-induced membrane protrusion dynamics. Our work strongly supports that spatial and temporal regulation of ERK activity is integrated to control signaling specificity from a single extracellular signal to multiple cellular processes.

Deciphering the mechanisms of axis formation in amphioxus is a key step to understanding the evolution of chordate body plan. The current view is that Nodal signaling is the only factor promoting the dorsal axis specification in the amphioxus whereas Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays no role in this process. Here, we re-examined the role of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in the dorsal/ventral patterning of amphioxus embryo. We demonstrated that the spatial activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is located in presumptive dorsal cells from cleavage to gastrula stage, and provided functional evidence that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for the specification of dorsal cell fate in a stage-dependent manner. Microinjection of <i>Wnt8</i> and <i>Wnt11</i> mRNA induced ectopic dorsal axis in neurulae and larvae. Finally, we demonstrated that Nodal and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cooperate to promote the dorsal-specific gene expression in amphioxus gastrula. Our study reveals high evolutionary conservation of dorsal organizer formation in the chordate lineage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56371">Presynaptic APP levels and synaptic homeostasis are regulated by Akt phosphorylation of Huntingtin</a></h4>

Studies have suggested that amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic homeostasis, but the evidence has not been consistent. In particular, signaling pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding protein involved in Huntington's disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and increased synaptic density. Ablating <i>in vivo</i> HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56345">Paranoia as a deficit in non-social belief updating</a></h4>

Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal learning behavior and computational modeling to estimate belief updating across individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats chronically exposed to methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated with a stronger prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55487">HIV efficiently infects T cells from the endometrium and remodels them to promote systemic viral spread</a></h4>

The female reproductive tract (FRT) is the most common site of infection during HIV transmission to women, but viral remodeling complicates characterization of cells targeted for infection. Here, we report extensive phenotypic analyses of HIV-infected endometrial cells by CyTOF, and use a ‘nearest neighbor’ bioinformatics approach to trace cells to their original pre-infection phenotypes. Like in blood, HIV preferentially targets memory CD4+ T cells in the endometrium, but these cells exhibit unique phenotypes and sustain much higher levels of infection. Genital cell remodeling by HIV includes downregulating TCR complex components and modulating chemokine receptor expression to promote dissemination of infected cells to lymphoid follicles. HIV also upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5, which when blocked promotes death of infected endometrial cells. These results suggest that HIV remodels genital T cells to prolong viability and promote viral dissemination and that interfering with these processes might reduce the likelihood of systemic viral spread.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55352">Type I interferon underlies severe disease associated with Junín virus infection in mice</a></h4>

Junín virus (JUNV) is one of five New World mammarenaviruses (NWMs) that cause fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). The pathogenesis underlying AHF is poorly understood; however, a prolonged, elevated interferon-a (IFN-a) response is associated with a negative disease outcome. A feature of all NWMs that cause viral hemorrhagic fever is the use of human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) for cellular entry. Here, we show that mice expressing hTfR1 develop a lethal disease course marked by an increase in serum IFN-a concentration when challenged with JUNV. Further, we provide evidence that the type I IFN response is central to the development of severe JUNV disease in hTfR1 mice. Our findings identify TfR1-mediated entry and the type I IFN response as key factors in the pathogenesis of JUNV infection in mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55252">Differences in reward biased spatial representations in the lateral septum and hippocampus</a></h4>

The lateral septum (LS), which is innervated by the hippocampus, is known to represent spatial information. However, the details of place representation in the LS, and whether this place information is combined with reward signaling, remains unknown. We simultaneously recorded from rat CA1 and caudodorsal lateral septum in rat during a rewarded navigation task and compared spatial firing in the two areas. While LS place cells are less numerous than in hippocampus, they are similar to the hippocampus in field size and number of fields per cell, but with field shape and center distributions that are more skewed towards reward. Spike cross-correlations between the hippocampus and LS are greatest for cells that have reward-proximate place fields, suggesting a role for the LS in relaying task-relevant hippocampal spatial information to downstream areas, such as the VTA.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54612">Regulation of nerve growth and patterning by cell surface protein disulphide isomerase</a></h4>

Contact repulsion of growing axons is an essential mechanism for spinal nerve patterning. In birds and mammals the embryonic somites generate a linear series of impenetrable barriers, forcing axon growth cones to traverse one half of each somite as they extend towards their body targets. This study shows that protein disulphide isomerase provides a key component of these barriers, mediating contact repulsion at the cell surface in chick half-somites. Repulsion is reduced both <i>in vivo </i>and <i>in vitro</i> by a range of methods that inhibit enzyme activity. The activity is critical in initiating a nitric oxide/S-nitrosylation-dependent signal transduction pathway that regulates the growth cone cytoskeleton. Rat forebrain grey matter extracts contain a similar activity, and the enzyme is expressed at the surface of cultured human astrocytic cells and rat cortical astrocytes. We suggest this system is co-opted in the brain to counteract and regulate aberrant nerve terminal growth.

In mammals, testicular differentiation is initiated by transcription factors SRY and SOX9 in XY gonads, and ovarian differentiation involves R-spondin1 (RSPO1) mediated activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in XX gonads. Accordingly, the absence of <i>RSPO1/Rspo1</i> in XX humans and mice leads to testicular differentiation and female-to-male sex reversal in a manner that does not require<i>Sry</i> or <i>Sox9</i> in mice. Here we show that an alternate testis-differentiating factor exists and that this factor is <i>Sox8</i>. Specifically, genetic ablation of <i>Sox8</i> and <i>Sox9</i> prevents ovarian-to-testicular reprogramming observed in XX <i>Rspo1</i> loss-of-function mice. Consequently, <i>Rspo1 Sox8 Sox9</i> triple mutant gonads developed as atrophied ovaries. Thus, SOX8 alone can compensate for the loss of SOX9 for Sertoli cell differentiation during female-to-male sex reversal.

AMPARs control fast synaptic communication between neurons and their function relies on auxiliary subunits, which importantly modulate channel properties. Although it has been suggested that AMPARs can bind to TARPs with variable stoichiometry, little is known about the effect that this stoichiometry exerts on certain AMPAR properties. Here we have found that AMPARs show a clear stoichiometry-dependent modulation by the prototypical TARP γ2 although the receptor still needs to be fully saturated with γ2 to show some typical TARP-induced characteristics (i.e. an increase in channel conductance). We also uncovered important differences in the stoichiometric modulation between calcium-permeable and calcium-impermeable AMPARs. Moreover, in heteromeric AMPARs, γ2 positioning in the complex is important to exert certain TARP-dependent features. Finally, by comparing data from recombinant receptors with endogenous AMPAR currents from mouse cerebellar granule cells, we have determined a likely presence of two γ2 molecules at somatic receptors in this cell type.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52868">Nuclei determine the spatial origin of mitotic waves</a></h4>

Traveling waves play an essential role in coordinating mitosis over large distances, but what determines the spatial origin of mitotic waves remains unclear. Here, we show that such waves initiate at pacemakers, regions which oscillate faster than their surroundings. In cell-free extracts of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> eggs, we find that nuclei define such pacemakers by concentrating cell cycle regulators. In computational models of diffusively coupled oscillators that account for nuclear import, nuclear positioning determines the pacemaker location. Furthermore, we find that the spatial dimensions of the oscillatory medium change the nuclear positioning and strongly influence whether a pacemaker is more likely to be at a boundary or an internal region. Finally, we confirm experimentally that increasing the system width increases the proportion of pacemakers at the boundary. Our work provides insight into how nuclei and spatial system dimensions can control local concentrations of regulators, influencing the emergent behavior of mitotic waves.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52658">Fast and reversible neural inactivation in macaque cortex by optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

Reversible optogenetic neural inactivation techniques are valuable for linking neural activity and behavior but they have serious limitations in macaques. To achieve powerful and temporally precise neural inactivation, we used an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector carrying the channelrhodopsin-2 gene under the control of a Dlx5/6 enhancer, which restricts expression to GABAergic neurons. We tested this approach in the primary visual cortex, an area where neural inactivation leads to interpretable behavioral deficits. Optical stimulation modulated spiking activity and reduced visual sensitivity profoundly in the region of space represented by the stimulated neurons. Rebound firing, which can have unwanted effects on neural circuits following inactivation, was not observed, and the efficacy of the optogenetic manipulation on behavior was maintained across &gt;1000 trials. We conclude that this inhibitory cell-type specific optogenetic approach is a powerful and spatiotemporally precise neural inactivation tool with broad utility for probing the functional contributions of different cortical areas in macaques.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51027">Estimates of the global burden of Japanese Encephalitis and the impact of vaccination from 2000-2015</a></h4>

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease, known for its high mortality and disability rate among symptomatic cases. Many effective vaccines are available for JE, and the use of a recently developed and inexpensive vaccine, SA 14-14-2, has been increasing over the recent years particularly with Gavi support. Estimates of the local burden and the past impact of vaccination are therefore increasingly needed, but difficult due to the limitations of JE surveillance. In this study, we implemented a mathematical modelling method (catalytic model) combined with age-stratifed case data from our systematic review which can overcome some of these limitations. We estimate in 2015 JEV infections caused 100,308 JE cases (95%CI: 61,720 - 157,522) and 25,125 deaths (95%CI: 14,550 - 46,031) globally, and that between 2000 and 2015 307,774 JE cases (95%CI: 167,442- 509,583) were averted due to vaccination globally. Our results highlight areas that could have the greatest benefit from starting vaccination or from scaling up existing programs and will be of use to support local and international policymakers in making vaccine allocation decisions.

Single-units were recorded in hippocampus, septum, and striatum while freely behaving rats (n=3) ran trials in a T-maze task, and rested in a holding bucket between trials. During periods of motor inactivity, SWRs triggered excitatory responses from 28% (64/226) and inhibitory responses from 14% (31/226) of septal neurons. By contrast, only 4% (14/378) of striatal neurons were excited and 6% (24/378) were inhibited during SWRs. In both structures, SWR-responsive neurons exhibited greater spike coherence with hippocampal theta rhythm than neurons that did not respond to SWRs. In septum, neurons that were excited by SWRs fired at late phases of the theta cycle, whereas neurons that were inhibited by SWRs fired at early phases of the theta cycle. By contrast, SWR-responsive striatal neurons did not show consistent phase preferences during the theta cycle. A subset of SWR-responsive neurons in septum (55/95) and striatum (26/38) behaved as speed cells, with firing rates that were positively or negatively modulated by the rat's running speed. In both structures, firing rates of most SWR-excited speed cells were positively modulated by running speed, whereas firing rates of most SWR-inhibited speed cells were negatively modulated by running speed. These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that SWRs can activate subcortical representations of motor actions in conjunction with hippocampal representations of places and states, which may be important for storing and retrieving values of state-action pairs during reinforcement learning and memory consolidation.

To understand how cells communicate in the nervous system, it is essential to define their secretome, which is challenging for primary cells because of large cell numbers being required. Here, we miniaturized secretome analysis by developing the high-performance secretome-protein-enrichment-with-click-sugars method (hiSPECS). To demonstrate its broad utility, hiSPECS was used to identify the secretory response of brain slices upon LPS-induced neuroinflammation and to establish the cell type-resolved mouse brain secretome resource using primary astrocytes, microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes. This resource allowed mapping the cellular origin of CSF proteins and revealed that an unexpectedly high number of secreted proteins in vitro and in vivo are proteolytically-cleaved membrane protein ectodomains. Two examples are neuronally secreted ADAM22 and CD200, which we identified as substrates of the Alzheimer-linked protease BACE1. hiSPECS and the brain secretome resource can be widely exploited to systematically study protein secretion, brain function and to identify cell type-specific biomarkers for CNS diseases.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hours) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hours eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.</p>

<p>The central complex in the insect brain is a higher order integration center and plays an important role in spatial orientation. Honeybees are excellent models to study the neuronal basis of orientation, due to their excellent homing skills. Here we present a catalogue of neurons in the honeybee central complex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee <i>Apis mellifera </i>. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee's central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.</p>

<p>In order to keep trace of information, the brain has to resolve the problem
where information is and how to index new ones. We propose that the neural
mechanism used by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to detect structure in temporal
sequences, based on the temporal order of incoming information, has served as
second purpose to the spatial ordering and indexing of brain networks. We call
this process, apparent to the manipulation of neural 'addresses' to organize
the brain's own network, the 'digitalization' of information. Such tool is
important for information processing and preservation, but also for memory
formation and retrieval.

<p>We localize the sources of brain activity of children with epilepsy based on
EEG recordings acquired during a visual discrimination working memory task. For
the numerical solution of the inverse problem, with the aid of age-specific MRI
scans processed from a publicly available database, we use and compare three
regularization numerical methods, namely the standarized Low Resolution
Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA), the weighted Minimum Norm Estimation
(wMNE) and the dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM). We show that all
three methods provide the same spatio-temporal patterns of differences between
epileptic and control children. In particular, our analysis reveals
statistically significant differences between the two groups in regions of the
Parietal Cortex indicating that these may serve as "biomarkers" for diagnostic
purposes and ultimately localized treatment.

<p>In this paper, the generalized regression neural network is used to predict
the GNSS position time series. Using the IGS 24-hour final solution data for
Bad Hamburg permanent GNSS station in Germany, it is shown that the larger the
training of the network, the higher the accuracy is, regardless of the time
span of the time series. In order to analyze the performance of the neural
network in various conditions, 14 permanent stations are used in different
countries, namely, Spain, France, Romania, Poland, Russian Federation, United
Kingdom, Czech Republic, Sweden, Ukraine, Italy, Finland, Slovak Republic,
Cyprus, and Greece. The performance analysis is divided into two parts,
continuous data-without gaps-and discontinuous ones-having intervals of gaps
with no data available. Three measure of error are presented, namely, symmetric
mean absolute percentage error, standard deviation, and mean of absolute
errors. It is shown that for discontinuous data the position can be predicted
with an accuracy of up to 6 centimeters, while the continuous data positions
present a higher prediction accuracy, as high as 3 centimeters. In order to
compare the results of this machine learning algorithm with the traditional
statistical approaches, the Theta method is used, which is well-established for
high-accuracy time series prediction. The comparison shows that the generalized
regression neural network machine learning algorithm presents better accuracy
than the Theta method, possibly up to 250 times. In addition, it is
approximately 4.6 times faster.

<p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a research field concerned with utilizing
optimization algorithms to design optimal neural network architectures. There
are many approaches concerning the architectural search spaces, optimization
algorithms, as well as candidate architecture evaluation methods. As the field
is growing at a continuously increasing pace, it is difficult for a beginner to
discern between major, as well as emerging directions the field has followed.
In this work, we provide an introduction to the basic concepts of NAS for
convolutional networks, along with the major advances in search spaces,
algorithms and evaluation techniques.

<p>The widely parallel, spiking neural networks of neuromorphic processors can
enable computationally powerful formulations. While recent interest has focused
on primarily machine learning tasks, the space of appropriate applications is
wide and continually expanding. Here, we leverage the parallel and event-driven
structure to solve a steady state heat equation using a random walk method. The
random walk can be executed fully within a spiking neural network using
stochastic neuron behavior, and we provide results from both IBM TrueNorth and
Intel Loihi implementations. Additionally, we position this algorithm as a
potential scalable benchmark for neuromorphic systems.

<p>The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ), denoted as senile plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) in the brain are two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current and most accepted hypothesis proposes that the oligomerization of Aβ peptides triggers the polymerization and accumulation of amyloid, which leads to the senile plaques. Several strategies have been reported to target Aβ oligomerization/polymerization. Since it is thought that Aβ levels in the brain and peripheral blood maintain equilibrium, it has been hypothesized that enhancing peripheral clearance (by shifting this equilibrium towards the blood) might reduce Aβ levels in the brain, known as the sink effect. This process has been reported to be effective, showing a reduction in Aβ burden in the brain as a consequence of the peripheral reduction of Aβ levels. Nanoparticles (NPs) may have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), initially due to their size. It is not clear whether particles in the range of 50–100 nm should be able to cross the BBB without being specifically modified for it. Despite the size limitation of crossing the BBB, several NP derivatives may be proposed as therapeutic tools. The purpose of this review is to summarize some therapeutic approaches based on nanoliposomes using two complementary examples: First, unilamellar nanoliposomes containing Aβ generic ligands, such as sphingolipids, gangliosides or curcumin, or some sphingolipid bound to the binding domain of ApoE; and second, nanoliposomes containing monoclonal antibodies against Aβ. Following similar rationale NPs of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol) conjugated with curcumin-derivate (PLGA-PEG-B6/Cur) were reported to improve the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice, compared with native curcumin treatment. Also, some new nanostructures such as exosomes have been proposed as a putative therapeutic and prevention strategies of AD. Although the unquestionable interest of this issue is beyond the scope of this review article. The potential mechanisms and significance of nanoliposome therapies for AD, which are still are in clinical trials, will be discussed.</p>

<p>In the mature cochlea, each inner hair cell (IHC) is innervated by multiple spiral ganglion neurons of type I (SGNI). SGNIs are morphologically and electro-physiologically diverse. Also, they differ in their susceptibility to noise insult. However, the molecular underpinnings of their identity and physiological differences remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a novel triple transgenic mouse, which enabled the isolation of pure populations of SGNIs and the analysis of a 96-gene panel via single-cell qPCR. We found three distinct populations of Type I SGNs, which were marked by their exclusive expression of Lmx1a, Slc4a4, or Mfap4/Fzd2, respectively, at postnatal days P3, P8, and P12. Our data suggest that afferent SGN subtypes are established genetically before the onset of hearing and that the expression of key physiological markers, such as ion channels, is heterogeneous and may be underlying the heterogeneous firing proprieties of SGNIs.</p>

<p>The most evident phenotype of degenerative motoneuron disease is the loss of motor function which accompanies motoneuron death. In both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), it is now clear that dysfunction is not restricted to motoneurons but is manifest in the spinal circuits in which motoneurons are embedded. As mounting evidence shows that motoneurons possess more elaborate and extensive connections within the spinal cord than previously realized, it is necessary to consider the role of this circuitry and its dysfunction in the disease process. In this review article, we ask if the selective vulnerability of the different motoneuron types and the relative disease resistance of distinct motoneuron groups can be understood in terms of their intraspinal connections.</p>

<p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), known as satellite cells (SCs) have an incredible ability to regenerate, which enables the maintenance and growth of muscle tissue. In response to damaging stimuli, SCs are activated, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to repair or generate a new muscle fiber. However, dystrophic muscles are characterized by poor muscle regeneration along with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Indications for SC involvement in muscular dystrophy pathologies are accumulating, but their contribution to muscle pathophysiology is not precisely understood. In congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (LAMA2-CMD), mutations in Lama2 gene cause either complete or partial absence in laminin-211 protein. Laminin-211 functions as a link between muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) and two adhesion systems in the sarcolemma; one is the well-known dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC), and the second is the integrin complex. Because of its protein interactions and location, laminin-211 has a crucial role in muscle function and survival by maintaining sarcolemma integrity. In addition, laminin-211 is expressed in SCs and suggested to have a role in SC proliferation and differentiation. Downstream to the primary defect in laminin-211, several secondary genes and pathways accelerate disease mechanism, while at the same time there are unsuccessful attempts to regenerate as compensation for the dystrophic process. Lately, next-generation sequencing platforms have advanced our knowledge about the secondary events occurring in various diseases, elucidate the pathophysiology, and characterize new essential targets for development of new treatment strategies. This review will mainly focus on SC contribution to impaired regeneration in muscular dystrophies and specifically new findings suggesting SC involvement in LAMA2-CMD pathology.</p>

<p>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are among the most significant genetic risk factors for developing late onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand whether a therapeutic can modulate LRRK2 levels as a potential disease modifying strategy, it is important to have methods in place to measure the protein with high sensitivity and specificity. To date, LRRK2 measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have used extracellular vesicle enrichment via differential ultracentrifugation and western blot detection. Our goal was to develop a methodology which could be deployed in a clinical trial, therefore throughput, robustness and sensitivity were critical. To this end, we developed a Stable Isotope Standard Capture by Anti-peptide Antibody (SISCAPA) assay which is capable of detecting LRRK2 from 1 ml of human CSF. The assay uses a commercially available LRRK2 monoclonal antibody (N241A/34) and does not require extracellular vesicle enrichment steps. The assay includes stable isotope peptide addition which allows for absolute quantitation of LRRK2 protein. We determined that the assay performed adequately for CSF measurements and that blood contamination from traumatic lumbar puncture does not pose a serious analytical challenge. We then applied this technique to 106 CSF samples from the MJFF LRRK2 Cohort Consortium which includes healthy controls, sporadic PD patients and LRRK2 mutation carriers with and without PD. Of the 105 samples that had detectable LRRK2 signal, we found that the PD group with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation had significantly higher CSF LRRK2 levels compared to all other groups. We also found that CSF LRRK2 increased with the age of the participant. Taken together, this work represents a step forward in our ability to measure LRRK2 in a challenging matrix like CSF which has implications for current and future LRRK2 therapeutic clinical trials.</p>

<p>Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive fatal neurodegenerative condition. There are no effective treatments. The only globally licensed medication, that prolongs life by 2–3 months, was approved by the FDA in 1995. One reason for the absence of effective treatments is disease heterogeneity noting that ALS is clinically heterogeneous and can be considered to exist on a neuropathological spectrum with frontotemporal dementia. Despite this significant clinical heterogeneity, protein misfolding has been identified as a unifying pathological feature in these cases. Based on this shared pathophysiology, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the therapeutic efficacy of compounds that specifically target protein misfolding in preclinical studies of both ALS and FTD.</p><p>Methods: Three databases: (i) PubMed, (ii) MEDLINE, and (iii) EMBASE were searched. All studies comparing the effect of treatments targeting protein misfolding in pre-clinical ALS or FTD models to a control group were retrieved.</p><p>Results: Systematic review identified 70 pre-clinical studies investigating the effects of therapies targeting protein misfolding on survival. Meta-analysis revealed that targeting protein misfolding did significantly improve survival compared to untreated controls (p &lt; 0.001, df = 68, α = 0.05, CI 1.05–1.16), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Further subgroup analyses, evaluating the effect of timing of these interventions, showed that, only treating prior to symptom onset (n = 33), significantly improved survival (p &lt; 0.001, df = 31, α = 0.05, CI 1.08–1.29), although this likely reflects the inadequate sample size of later time points. Furthermore, arimoclomol was found to significantly reduce secondary outcome measures including: (i) histological outcomes, (ii) behavioral outcomes, and (iii) biochemical outcomes (p &lt; 0.005).</p><p>Conclusions: This analysis supports the hypothesis that protein misfolding plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD and that targeting protein misfolding, at least in pre-clinical models, can significantly improve survival, especially if such an intervention is administered prior to symptom onset.</p>

<p>It has been 15 years since the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was identified as the most common genetic cause for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two most common mutations are the LRRK2-G2019S, located in the kinase domain, and the LRRK2-R1441C, located in the ROC-COR domain. While the LRRK2-G2019S mutation is associated with increased kinase activity, the LRRK2-R1441C exhibits a decreased GTPase activity and altered kinase activity. Multiple lines of evidence have linked the LRRK2 protein with a role in the autophagy pathway and with lysosomal activity in neurons. Neurons rely heavily on autophagy to recycle proteins and process cellular waste due to their post-mitotic state. Additionally, lysosomal activity decreases with age which can potentiate the accumulation of α-synuclein, the pathological hallmark of PD, and subsequently lead to the build-up of Lewy bodies (LBs) observed in this disorder. This review provides an up to date summary of the LRRK2 field to understand its physiological role in the autophagy pathway in neurons and related cells. Careful assessment of how LRRK2 participates in the regulation of phagophore and autophagosome formation, autophagosome and lysosome fusion, lysosomal maturation, maintenance of lysosomal pH and calcium levels, and lysosomal protein degradation are addressed. The autophagy pathway is a complex cellular process and due to the variety of LRRK2 models studied in the field, associated phenotypes have been reported to be seemingly conflicting. This review provides an in-depth discussion of different models to assess the normal and disease-associated role of the LRRK2 protein on autophagic function. Given the importance of the autophagy pathway in Parkinson’s pathogenesis it is particularly relevant to focus on the role of LRRK2 to discover novel therapeutic approaches that restore lysosomal protein degradation homeostasis.</p>

<p>Stroke patients often suffer from spasticity. Before treatment of spasticity, there are often practical demands for objective and quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity. However, the common quantitative spasticity assessment method, the tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT), is time-consuming and complicated to implement due to the requirement of multiple passive stretches. To evaluate spasticity conveniently, a novel spasticity evaluation method based on surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (i.e., the sEMG-ANFIS method) was presented in this paper. Eleven stroke patients with spasticity and four healthy subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. During the experiment, the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) scores of each subject was obtained and sEMG signals from four elbow flexors or extensors were collected from several times (4–5) repetitions of passive stretching. Four time-domain features (root mean square, the zero-cross rate, the wavelength and a 4th-order autoregressive model coefficient) and one frequency-domain feature (the mean power frequency) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals to reflect the spasticity information. Using the ANFIS classifier, excellent regression performance was achieved [mean accuracy = 0.96, mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.13], outperforming the classical TSRT method (accuracy = 0.88, RMSE = 0.28). The results showed that the sEMG-ANFIS method not only has higher accuracy but also is convenient to implement by requiring fewer repetitions (4–5) of passive stretches. The sEMG-ANFIS method can help stroke patients develop proper rehabilitation training programs and can potentially be used to provide therapeutic feedback for some new spasticity interventions, such as shockwave therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>

<p>Stable and efficient coordination in physical human-robot interaction requires consideration of human feedback behavior. In unpredictable tasks, where voluntary cognitive feedback is too slow to guarantee desired task execution, the human must rely on involuntary intrinsic and reflexive feedback. The combined effects of these two feedback mechanisms and the inertial characteristics can be summarized in the involuntary impedance components. In this work, we present a method for the estimation of the involuntary impedance components of the human arm in multi-joint movements. We apply force perturbations to evoke feedback jerks that can be isolated using a high pass filter and limit the duration of the estimation interval to guarantee exclusion of voluntary cognitive feedback. Dynamic regressor representation of the rigid body dynamics of the arm and first order Taylor series expansion of the feedback behavior yield a model that is linear in the involuntary impedance components. The constant values of the inertial parameters are estimated in a static posture maintenance task and subsequently inserted to estimate the remaining components in a dynamic movement task. The method is validated with simulated data of a neuromechanical model of the human arm and its performance is compared to established methods from the literature. The results of the validation demonstrate superior estimation performance for moderate movement velocities, and less influence of the variability of the movements. The applicability to real data and the plausibility of the limited estimation interval are successfully demonstrated in an experiment with human participants.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the functional activity of the cerebral cortex. The concentration changes of oxygenated (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) can be detected and associated with activation of the cortex in the investigated area (neurovascular coupling). Recorded signals of hemodynamic responses may contain influences from physiological signals (systemic influences, physiological artifacts) which do not originate from the cerebral cortex activity. The physiological artifacts contain the blood pressure (BP), respiratory patterns, and the pulsation of the heart. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis of recorded fNIRS data, a proper correction of these physiological artifacts is necessary. This article introduces NICA – a novel toolbox for near-infrared spectroscopy calculations and analyses based on MATLAB. With NICA it is possible to process and visualize fNIRS data, including different signal processing methods for physiological artifact correction. The artifact correction methods used in this toolbox are common average reference (CAR), independent component analysis (ICA), and transfer function (TF) models. A practical example provides results from a study, where NICA was used for analyzing the measurement data, in order to demonstrate the signal processing steps and the physiological artifact correction. The toolbox was developed for fNIRS data recorded with the NIRScout 1624 measurement device and the corresponding recording software NIRStar.</p>

<p>Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject; the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction. The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.</p>

<p>Every joint collaborative physical activity performed by a group of people, e.g., carrying a table, typically leads to the emergence of spatiotemporal coordination of individual motor behavior. Such interpersonal coordination can arise solely based on the observation of the partners' and/or the object's movements, without the presence of verbal communication. In this paper, we investigate how the social coupling between two individuals in a collaborative task translates into measured objective and subjective performance indicators recorded in two different studies. We analyse the trends in the dyadic interrelationship based on the information-theoretic measure of transfer entropy and identify emerging leader-follower roles. In our experimental paradigm, the actions of the pair of subjects are continuously and seamlessly fused, resulting in a joint control of an object simulated on a tablet computer. Subjects need to synchronize their movements with a 90° phase difference in order to keep the object (a ball) rotating precisely on a predefined circular or elliptic trajectory on a tablet device. Results demonstrate how the identification of causal dependencies in this social interaction task could reveal specific trends in human behavior and provide insights into the emergence of social sensorimotor contingencies.</p>

<p>Objective: This study evaluated cortical encoding of voice onset time (VOT) in quiet and noise, and their potential associations with the behavioral categorical perception of VOT in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD).</p><p>Design: Subjects were 11 children with ANSD ranging in age between 6.4 and 16.2 years. The stimulus was an /aba/-/apa/ vowel-consonant-vowel continuum comprising eight tokens with VOTs ranging from 0 ms (voiced endpoint) to 88 ms (voiceless endpoint). For speech in noise, speech tokens were mixed with the speech-shaped noise from the Hearing In Noise Test at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +5 dB. Speech-evoked auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral categorization perception of VOT were measured in quiet in all subjects, and at an SNR of +5 dB in seven subjects. The stimuli were presented at 35 dB SL (re: pure tone average) or 115 dB SPL if this limit was less than 35 dB SL. In addition to the onset response, the auditory change complex (ACC) elicited by VOT was recorded in eight subjects.</p><p>Results: Speech evoked ERPs recorded in all subjects consisted of a vertex positive peak (i.e., P1), followed by a trough occurring approximately 100 ms later (i.e., N2). For results measured in quiet, there was no significant difference in categorical boundaries estimated using ERP measures and behavioral procedures. Categorical boundaries estimated in quiet using both ERP and behavioral measures closely correlated with the most-recently measured Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten (PBK) scores. Adding a competing background noise did not affect categorical boundaries estimated using either behavioral or ERP procedures in three subjects. For the other four subjects, categorical boundaries estimated in noise using behavioral measures were prolonged. However, adding background noise only increased categorical boundaries measured using ERPs in three out of these four subjects.</p><p>Conclusions: VCV continuum can be used to evaluate behavioral identification and the neural encoding of VOT in children with ANSD. In quiet, categorical boundaries of VOT estimated using behavioral measures and ERP recordings are closely associated with speech recognition performance in children with ANSD. Underlying mechanisms for excessive speech perception deficits in noise may vary for individual patients with ANSD.</p>

<p>Background: Unilateral spatial neglectis an attention disorder frequently occurring after a right-hemispheric stroke. Neglect results in a reduction in qualityof life and performance in activities of daily living. With current technical improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology, trainingwith stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMD) has become a promising new approach for the assessment and the rehabilitation of neglect. The focus of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate a simple visual search task in VR for HMD. The VR system was tested regarding feasibility, acceptance, and potential adverse effects in healthy controls and right-hemispheric stroke patients with and without neglect.</p><p>Methods: The VR system consisted of two main components, a head-mounted display to present the virtual environment, and a hand-held controller for the interaction with the latter. The task followed the rationale of diagnostic paper-pencil cancellation tasks; i.e., the participants were asked to search targets among distractors. However, instead of a two-dimensional setup, the targets and distractors were arranged in three dimensions, in a sphere around the subject inside its field of view. Usability and acceptance of the task, as well as the performance in the latter, were tested in 15 right-hemispheric subacute stroke patients (10 of whom with and five of whom without unilateral spatial neglect; mean age: 67.1 ± 10.5 years) and 35 age-matched healthy controls.</p><p>Results: System usability and acceptance were rated as high both in stroke patients and healthy controls, close to the maximum score of the questionnaire scale. No relevant adverse effects occurred. There was a high correlation (r = 0.854, p = 0.002) between the Center of Cancellation [an objective neglect measure) calculated from a paper-pencil cancellation task (Sensitive Neglect Test (SNT)] and the newly developed VR cancellation task.</p><p>Conclusion: Overall, the developed visual search task in the tested VR system is feasible, well-accepted, enjoyable, and does not evoke any significant negative effects, both for healthy controls and for stroke patients. Findings for task performance show that the ability of the VR cancellation to detect neglect in stroke patients is similar to paper-pencil cancellation tasks.</p>

<p>Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proposed as a new therapeutic way to enhance the cognition of patients with dementia. However, serious methodological limitations appear to affect the estimates of their efficacy. We reviewed the stimulation parameters and methods of studies that used TMS or tDCS to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we evaluated the risk of bias in these studies. Our aim was to highlight the current vulnerabilities of the field and to formulate recommendations on how to manage these issues when designing studies.</p><p>Methods: Electronic databases and citation searching were used to identify studies administering TMS or tDCS on patients with AD or MCI to enhance cognitive function. Data were extracted by one review author into summary tables with the supervision of the authors. The risk of bias analysis of randomized-controlled trials was conducted by two independent assessors with version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.</p><p>Results: Overall, 36 trials were identified of which 23 randomized-controlled trials underwent a risk of bias assessment. More than 75% of randomized-controlled trials involved some levels of bias in at least one domain. Stimulation parameters were highly variable with some ranges of effectiveness emerging. Studies with low risk of bias indicated TMS to be potentially effective for patients with AD or MCI while questioned the efficacy of tDCS.</p><p>Conclusions: The presence and extent of methodical issues affecting TMS and tDCS research involving patients with AD and MCI were examined for the first time. The risk of bias frequently affected the domains of the randomization process and selection of the reported data while missing outcome was rare. Unclear reporting was present involving randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Methodological awareness can potentially reduce the high variability of the estimates regarding the effectiveness of TMS and tDCS. Studies with low risk of bias delineate a range within TMS parameters seem to be effective but question the efficacy of tDCS.</p>

<p>Repetitive sensory stimulation of the fingertip induces Hebbian plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex that benefits the tactile and motor behavior of the hand in healthy younger adults, older adults, and patients. To use this method outside the laboratory, robust and portable stimulation systems are needed that allow prolonged stimulation phases over several hours without compromising on signal intensity or personal mobility. Here, we introduce two stimulation gloves that apply finger- and frequency-specific mechanical stimulation to individual fingertips over prolonged periods. The stimulators are built into commercially available cotton gloves and apply stimulation either via loudspeaker membranes or via linear resonant actuators (LRAs). We tested the efficiency of both gloves to induce Hebbian plasticity in younger adults by using two established measures of tactile performance, the grating orientation task (GOT), and the two-point discrimination task (2PDT). Both tests were performed before and after 3 h of sensory finger stimulation using one of either glove system. As a control condition, a non-stimulated finger was tested in both tasks before and after stimulation. The results show no significant effect of sensory stimulation on GOT thresholds, but a significant decrease in the 2PDT thresholds after compared to before the training at the stimulated finger only. The loudspeaker membrane improved performance in the 2PDT in 10/16 participants, whereas the LRA improved performance in the 2PDT in 13/16 participants. Stimulation gloves with built-in modules may be used in future larger-scale cohort studies on sensorimotor plasticity, rehabilitation, and learning.</p>

<p>Reduced selective voluntary motor control (SVMC) is a primary impairment due to corticospinal tract (CST) injury in spastic cerebral palsy (CP). There are few studies of brain metabolism in CP and none have examined brain metabolism during a motor task. Nine children with bilateral spastic CP [Age: 6-11 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels II–V] completed this study. SVMC was evaluated using Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (normal). Brain metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in association with a selective ankle motor task. Whole brain activation maps as well as ROI averaged metabolic activity were correlated with SCALE scores. The contralateral sensorimotor and superior parietal cortex were positively correlated with SCALE scores (p &lt; 0.0005). In contrast, a negative correlation of metabolic activity with SCALE was found in the cerebellum (p &lt; 0.0005). Subsequent ROI analysis showed that both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar metabolism correlated with SCALE but the relationship for the ipsilateral cerebellum was stronger (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80, p &lt; 0.001 vs. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46, p = 0.045). Decreased cortical and increased cerebellar activation in children with less SVMC may be related to task difficulty, activation of new motor learning paradigms in the cerebellum and potential engagement of alternative motor systems when CSTs are focally damaged. These results support SCALE as a clinical correlate of neurological impairment.</p>

<p>Neuroendocrine circuits are orchestrated by the pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic hormone-releasing and inhibiting factors to generate an ultradian and/or circadian rhythm of hormone secretion. However, mechanisms that govern this rhythmicity are not fully understood. It has been shown that synaptic transmission in the rodent hypothalamus undergoes cyclical changes in parallel with rhythmic hormone secretion and a growing body of evidence suggests that rapid rewiring of hypothalamic neurons may be the source of these changes. For decades, structural synaptic studies have been utilizing electron microscopy, which provides the resolution suitable for visualizing synapses. However, the small field of view, limited specificity and manual analysis susceptible to bias fuel the search for a more quantitative approach. Here, we apply the fluorescence super-resolution microscopy approach direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) to quantify and structurally characterize excitatory and inhibitory synapses that contact growth hormone-releasing-hormone (GHRH) neurons during peak and trough values of growth hormone (GH) concentration in mice. This approach relies on a three-color immunofluorescence staining of GHRH and pre- and post-synaptic markers, and a quantitative analysis with a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. With this method we confirm our previous findings, using electron microscopy, of increased excitatory synaptic input to GHRH neurons during peak levels of GH. Additionally, we find a shift in synapse numbers during low GH levels, where more inhibitory synaptic inputs are detected. Lastly, we utilize dSTORM to study novel aspects of synaptic structure. We show that more excitatory (but not inhibitory) pre-synaptic clusters associate with excitatory post-synaptic clusters during peaks of GH secretion and that the numbers of post-synaptic clusters increase during high hormone levels. The results presented here provide an opportunity to highlight dSTORM as a valuable quantitative approach to study synaptic structure in the neuroendocrine circuit. Importantly, our analysis of GH circuitry sheds light on the potential mechanism that drives ultradian changes in synaptic transmission and possibly aids in GH pulse generation in mice.</p>

Serum vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], folate and cobalamin concentrations were measured at visits 1 (v<sub>1</sub>: 2004–2009) and 2 (v<sub>2</sub>: 2009–2013), while structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI/dMRI) outcomes were measured at v<sub>scan</sub>: 2011–2015. Top 10 ranked adjusted associations were corrected for multiple testing using familywise Bonferroni (FWER &lt;0.05) and false discovery rates (FDR, q-value &lt; 0.10).</p><p>Results: We found statistically significant (FWER &lt; 0.05; β±SE) direct associations of 25(OH)D(v<sub>1</sub>) with WM volumes [overall: +910 ± 336/males: +2,054 ± 599], occipital WM; [overall: +140 ± 40, males: +261 ± 67 and Age<sub>v1</sub> &gt; 50 years: +205 ± 54]; parietal WM; [overall: +251 ± 77, males: +486 ± 129 and Age<sub>v1</sub> &gt; 50 years: +393 ± 108] and left occipital pole volume [overall: +15.70 ± 3.83 and above poverty: 19.0 ± 4.3], findings replicated for 25(OH)D (v<sub>2</sub>-v<sub>1</sub>) annualized exposure, which was also linked with greater WMI (fractional anisotropy, FA) in the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC); FWER &lt; 0.05 [Overall: +0.0020 ± 0.0004; Whites: +0.0024 ± 0.0004] and in the cingulum (hippocampus) [Overall: +0.0016 ± 0.0004]. Only trends were detected for cobalamin exposures (q &lt; 0.10), while serum folate (v<sub>1</sub>) was associated with lower mean diffusivity (MD) in ALIC, reflecting greater WMI, overall.</p><p>Conclusions: Among urban adults, serum 25(OH)D status and increase were consistently linked to larger occipital and parietal WM volumes and greater region-specific WMI. Pending longitudinal replication of our findings, randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation should be conducted against brain marker outcomes.</p>

<p>As a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture has the potential to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Emerging evidence indicates that the acupuncture-induced inhibition of high BP occurs through the activation of the pathway in the afferent, central, and efferent pathways. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture not only activates distinct brain regions under conditions of hypertension caused by an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems but also modulates neurotransmitters in related brain regions to alleviate the autonomic response. The activity of these pathways can be assessed by injecting agonists or inhibitors or by performing neurotomy. This review focuses on the clinical and mechanistic studies of acupuncture in modulating BP, which might provide a neurobiological foundation for the effects of acupuncture. Although many mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on cardiovascular function have been identified, further investigation is warranted.</p>

<p>Biological aging is a complex process involving multiple biological processes. These can be understood theoretically though considering them as individual networks—e.g., epigenetic networks, cell-cell networks (such as astroglial networks), and population genetics. Mathematical modeling allows the combination of such networks so that they may be studied in unison, to better understand how the so-called “seven pillars of aging” combine and to generate hypothesis for treating aging as a condition at relatively early biological ages. In this review, we consider how recent progression in mathematical modeling can be utilized to investigate aging, particularly in, but not exclusive to, the context of degenerative neuronal disease. We also consider how the latest techniques for generating biomarker models for disease prediction, such as longitudinal analysis and parenclitic analysis can be applied to as both biomarker platforms for aging, as well as to better understand the inescapable condition. This review is written by a highly diverse and multi-disciplinary team of scientists from across the globe and calls for greater collaboration between diverse fields of research.</p>

Here, we report a new link between the spatial-memory and scene-perception systems of the human brain. Using fine-grained individual-subject fMRI, we describe three cortical areas, each lying immediately anterior to a region of the scene perception network, that are selectively activated when recalling familiar places. Network analyses show that these regions constitute a distinct functional network and interface with memory systems during naturalistic scene understanding. These regions may bridge perception and memory, supporting visually-guided navigation.

Disparity between current and desired information, known as information gap, is an important driver of information-seeking and curiosity. To gain insight into its neural basis, we recorded responses of single neurons in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while rhesus macaques performed a task that induces and quantifies demand for information. We find that enhanced firing rates in dACC before the start of a trial predict a stronger bias towards information-seeking choices. Following choices of uninformative options, firing rates are tonically enhanced until information is delivered. The level of enhancement observed is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the value assigned to the prospective information. Finally, variation in this tone is positively correlated with receptiveness to new information, as inferred by preference changes on subsequent trials. These patterns are not observed in a complementary dataset collected in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), suggesting these effects reflect at least somewhat anatomically localized processing.

Sudoku is a popular leisure time activity that involves no math, but is based on logic based combinatorial number placement in a matrix. Many studies have been dedicated towards finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku but investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging. It is difficult to measure the brain activity during 9x9 Sudoku using traditional fMRI technique due to the procedural constraints. 16 optodes fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) forms an excellent alternative to study the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during Sudoku task. Sudoku task was divided into two steps to understand the differential function of the PFC while applying heuristic rules. Classical two-way ANOVA as well as General Linear Model based approach was used to analyze the data. 28-noise free recording from right-handed participants revealed increased activity in all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 x 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9x9 Sudoku) as compared to rest. Contrasting the step2-step1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated. These findings suggest the role of these regions, while applying multiple heuristic rules to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

The consolidation of motor memory is a non-linear temporal dynamic. There are critical time points at which post-training performance can improve (e.g., 30 min and 24 h) or merely stabilize (e.g., 4 h). Besides, neuronal plasticity is supported by synchronized oscillatory activity in and between brain areas at play during the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain cortical oscillatory activity, which may eventually modulate brain plasticity-related processes. Previous reports suggest that 20 Hz electrical stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) following training facilitates the consolidation of motor memories. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of tACS was not investigated when applied at critical post-training time points, nor its impact at longer time scales. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 20 Hz tACS applied over M1 within critical time periods (25min vs. 4h) on motor memory consolidation at immediate and delayed (24h) retrieval. Performance similarly evolved over time in all conditions, independently from the stimulation type (20 Hz tACS vs. Sham tACS) or the stimulation time point. As it stands, our results do not support the proposal that 20 Hz tACS exerts a positive, specific effect on the consolidation of motor memories.

BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain activity, as well as alterations in patterns of functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous studies in healthy participants suggest a strong association between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity that could be detected at an individual level, and show that brain activation in various tasks could be predicted from task-free fMRI scans. In the current study we aimed to predict brain activity in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, using a prediction model based on healthy individuals exclusively. This offers novel insights regarding the interrelations between brain connectivity and activity in schizophrenia. METHODS: We generated a prediction model using a group of 80 healthy controls that performed the well-validated N-back task, and used it to predict individual variability in task-evoked brain activation in 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: We demonstrated a successful prediction of individual variability in the task-evoked brain activation based on resting-state functional connectivity. The predictions were highly sensitive, reflected by high correlations between predicted and actual activation maps (Median=0.589,SD=0.193) and specific, evaluated by a Kolomogrov-Smirnov test (D=0.25,p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A Successful prediction of brain activity from resting-state functional connectivity highlights the strong coupling between the two. Moreover, our results support the notion that even though resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity are frequently reported to be altered in schizophrenia, the relations between them remains unaffected. This may allow to generate task activity maps for clinical populations without the need the actually perform the task.

Neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) plays important roles in the brain including control of energy homeostasis, sleep, learning and memory. However, the synaptic and circuitry mechanisms underlying MCH-mediated regulations remain largely unknown. Here, we uncover that MCH modulates the hippocampo (HP)-dorsal lateral septum (dLS)-lateral hypothalamus neural circuit to facilitate spatial learning and memory. MCH achieves this function by enhancing both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission via presynaptic mechanisms. The dLS neuronal spiking activity in response to HP CA3 excitatory inputs is strongly controlled by feed-forward inhibition (FFI) mediated by both GABAA and GABAB receptors. Endogenous MCH signaling enhances Signal/Noise (S/N) ratio of dLS neurons by increase the excitatory strengths, meanwhile decrease the overall dLS excitability by enhance inhibition which reduces dLS FFI, and consequentially enables dLS neurons to fire with high fidelity with HP synaptic inputs. Our data unravel the multifaceted synaptic mechanisms of MCH in the defined HP-dLS circuitry which may contribute to learning and memory.

Structure-function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically-based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in Drosophila, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and found that its role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of mWake mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non-neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of mWake+ cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWake+ cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.

The mounting evidence for the involvement of astrocytes in neuronal circuits function and behavior stands in stark contrast to the lack of detailed anatomical description of these cells and the neurons in their domains. To fill this void, we imaged &gt;30,000 astrocytes in cleared hippocampi, and employed converging genetic, histological and computational tools to determine the elaborate structure, distribution and neuronal content of astrocytic domains. First, we characterized the spatial distribution of &gt;19,000 astrocytes across CA1 lamina, and analyzed the detailed morphology of thousands of reconstructed domains. We then determined the excitatory content of CA1 astrocytes, averaging above 13 pyramidal neurons per domain and increasing towards CA1 midline. Finally, we discovered that somatostatin neurons are found in close proximity to astrocytes, compared to parvalbumin and VIP inhibitory neurons. This resource expands our understanding of fundamental hippocampal design principles, and provides the first quantitative foundation for neuron-astrocyte interactions in this region.

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are dynamic cells, constantly extending and retracting their processes as they contact and functionally regulate neurons and other glial cells. There is far less known about microglia-vascular interactions, particularly under healthy steady-state conditions. Here, we use the male and female mouse cerebral cortex to show that a higher percentage of microglia associate with the vasculature during the first week of postnatal development compared to older ages and the timing of these associations are dependent on the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1). Similar developmental microglia-vascular associations were detected in the prenatal human brain. Using live imaging in mice, we found that juxtavascular microglia migrated when microglia are actively colonizing the cortex and became stationary by adulthood to occupy the same vascular space for nearly 2 months. Further, juxtavascular microglia at all ages contact vascular areas void of astrocyte endfeet and the developmental shift in microglial migratory behavior along vessels corresponded to when astrocyte endfeet more fully ensheath vessels. Together, our data provide a comprehensive assessment of microglia-vascular interactions. They support a mechanism by which microglia use the vasculature to migrate within the developing brain parenchyma. This migration becomes restricted upon the arrival of astrocyte endfeet when juxtavascular microglia then establish a long-term, stable contact with the vasculature.

Many risky choices we make affect others in addition to ourselves, and choices made by others also affect us. To study the neural mechanisms underlying social responsibility, we used the following social decision paradigm. In each trial, participants or their game partner chose between a safe and a risky option in a gamble for money. If the risky option was chosen, the gamble was played out independently for both players, such that both could either win or lose the gamble. Participants reported their momentary happiness after experiencing the outcomes of the gambles. Responsibility influenced happiness: ratings were lower following negative outcomes resulting from participant' rather than their partner's choices. The findings of this first behavioural study were replicated in a separate participant sample in the second neuroimaging study. Insula activation was larger in response to negative social outcomes resulting from participants' rather than their partners' choices. A computational modelling-based analysis of these data revealed a cluster of voxels in left superior temporal sulcus whose activation fluctuated with reward prediction errors experienced by the game partner, but to a degree that varied depending on who made the choices leading to these prediction errors. These results suggest that the anterior insula and the superior temporal sulcus play complementary roles in the neural mechanisms of social responsibility.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.24.113811v1?rss=1">The visual ecology of Holocentridae, a nocturnal coral reef fish family with a deep-sea-like multibank retina</a></h4>

The visual systems of teleost fishes usually match their habitats and lifestyles. Since coral reefs are bright and colourful environments, the visual systems of their diurnal inhabitants have been more extensively studied than those of nocturnal species. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a detailed investigation of the visual systems of the coral reef fish family Holocentridae (squirrelfish and soldierfish). In addition to their nocturnality, this family is particularly interesting for dim-light vision studies due to its ecological and evolutionary connection to deeper habitats. Results showed that the visual system of holocentrids is well adapted to their nocturnal lifestyle with a rod-dominated retina. Surprisingly, rods in all species were arranged into 6-17 well-defined banks, a feature most commonly found in deep-sea fishes, that may increase the light sensitivity of the eye and/or allow colour discrimination in dim-light. Holocentrids also have the potential for dichromatic colour vision during the day with the presence of at least two spectrally different cone types: single cones expressing the blue-sensitive SWS2A gene, and double cones expressing one or two green-sensitive RH2 genes. Some differences were observed between the two subfamilies, with Holocentrinae having a slightly more developed photopic visual system than Myripristinae. Moreover, retinal topography of both ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors showed specific patterns for each cell type, likely highlighting different visual demands at different times of the day, such as feeding. Overall, their well-developed scotopic visual systems and the ease of catching and maintaining holocentrids in aquaria, make them ideal models to investigate teleost dim-light vision and more particularly shed light on the function of multibank retina and its potential for dim-light colour vision.

Presynaptic N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels are key for action potential evoked transmitter release in the peripheral and central nervous system. Previous studies have highlighted the functional relevance of N-type calcium channels at both the peripheral and central level. In the periphery, the N-type calcium channels regulate nociceptive and sympathetic responses. At the central level, N-type calcium channels have been linked to aggression, hyperlocomotion, and anxiety. Among the areas of the brain that are involved in anxiety are the basolateral amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral hippocampus. These three areas share similar characteristics in their neuronal circuitry. Pyramidal projection neurons are under the inhibitory control of a wide array of interneurons including those that express the peptide cholecystokinin. This type of interneuron is well-known to rely on N-type calcium channels to release GABA in the hippocampus, however whether these channels control GABA release from cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons in the basolateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex is not known. Here using sophisticated mouse models to genetically label cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons, we found that N-type calcium channels control ~50% of GABA release in basolateral amygdala. By contrast, N-type calcium channels are functionally absent in synapses of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons of medial prefrontal cortex. Our findings provide insights into the precise localization of N-type calcium channels in synapses of brain areas related to anxiety.

Internal states such as arousal, attention, and motivation are known to modulate brain-wide neural activity, but how these processes interact with learning is not well understood. During learning, the brain must modify the neural activity it produces to improve behavioral performance. How do internal states affect the evolution of this learning process? Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) learning paradigm in non-human primates, we identified large fluctuations in neural population activity in motor cortex (M1) indicative of arousal-like internal state changes. These fluctuations drove population activity along dimensions we term neural engagement axes. Neural engagement increased abruptly at the start of learning, and then gradually retreated. In a BCI, the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior is known. This allowed us to understand how these changes impacted behavioral performance for different task goals. We found that neural engagement interacted with learning, helping to explain why animals learned some task goals more quickly than others.

Patients suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) experience disturbed nociception in form of either hyposensitivity to pain or hypersensitivity and allodynia. We have determined that Shank2-KO mice, which recapitulate the genetic and behavioural disturbances of ASD, display increased sensitivity to formalin pain and thermal, but not mechanical allodynia. We demonstrate that high levels of Shank2 expression identifies a subpopulation of neurons in murine and human dorsal spinal cord, composed mainly by glycinergic interneurons and that loss of Shank2 causes the decrease in NMDAR in excitatory synapses on these inhibitory interneurons. In fact, in the subacute phase of the formalin test, glycinergic interneurons are strongly activated in WT mice but not in Shank2-KO mice. As consequence, nociception projection neurons in lamina I are activated in larger numbers in Shank2-KO mice. Our findings prove that Shank2 expression identifies a new subset of inhibitory interneurons involved in reducing the transmission of nociceptive stimuli and whose unchecked activation is associated with pain hypersensitivity. Thus, we provide evidence that dysfunction of spinal cord pain processing circuits may underlie the nociceptive phenotypes in ASD patients and mouse models.

Despite the importance of programming to modern society, the cognitive and neural bases of code comprehension are largely unknown. Programming languages might 'recycle' neurocognitive mechanisms originally used for natural languages. Alternatively, comprehension of code could depend on fronto-parietal networks shared with other culturally derived symbol systems, such as formal logic and math. Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same participants also performed language, math, formal logic, and executive control localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this network distinguish between "for" loops and "if" conditional code functions. Code comprehension overlapped extensively with neural basis of formal logic and to a lesser degree math. Overlap with simpler executive processes and language was low, but laterality of language and code covaried across individuals. Cultural symbol systems, including code, depend on a distinctive fronto-parietal cortical network.

Microsaccades have a steady rate of occurrence during maintained gaze fixation, which gets transiently modulated by abrupt sensory stimuli. Such modulation, characterized by a rapid reduction in microsaccade frequency followed by a stronger rebound phase of high microsaccade rate, is often described as the microsaccadic rate signature, owing to its stereotyped nature. Here we investigated the impacts of stimulus polarity (luminance increments or luminance decrements relative to background luminance) and size on the microsaccadic rate signature. We presented brief visual flashes consisting of large or small white or black stimuli over an otherwise gray image background. Both large and small stimuli caused robust early microsaccadic inhibition, but only small ones caused a subsequent increase in microsaccade frequency above baseline microsaccade rate. Critically, small black stimuli were always associated with stronger modulations in microsaccade rate after stimulus onset than small white stimuli, particularly in the post-inhibition rebound phase of the microsaccadic rate signature. Because small stimuli were also associated with expected direction oscillations to and away from their locations of appearance, these stronger rate modulations in the rebound phase meant higher likelihoods of microsaccades opposite the black flash locations relative to the white flash locations. Our results demonstrate that the microsaccadic rate signature is sensitive to stimulus polarity, and they point to dissociable neural mechanisms underlying early microsaccadic inhibition after stimulus onset and later microsaccadic rate rebound at longer times thereafter. These results also demonstrate early access of oculomotor control circuitry to sensory representations, particularly for momentarily inhibiting saccade generation.

Heightened responding to uncertain threat is associated with anxiety disorder pathology. Here, we sought to determine if individual differences in self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU) underlie differential recruitment of neural circuitry during instructed threat of shock (n = 42). During the task, cues signalled uncertain threat of shock (50%) or certain safety from shock. Ratings, skin conductance and functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. Overall, participants displayed greater amygdala activation to uncertain threat vs. safe cues, in the absence of an effect of IU. However, we found that high was associated with greater activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial rostral prefrontal cortex to uncertain threat vs safe cues. These findings suggest that, during instructed threat of shock, IU is specifically related, over trait anxiety, to activation in prefrontal cortical regions. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of self-reported IU in identifying mechanisms that may be related to conscious threat appraisal and anxiety disorder pathology.

Reproduction induces changes within brain to prepare for gestation and motherhood. However, the dynamic of these central changes and their relationships with the development of maternal behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a longitudinal morphometric neuroimaging study in female mice between pre-gestation and weaning, using new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resources comprising a high-resolution brain template, its associated tissue priors (60 microns isotropic resolution) and a corresponding mouse brain atlas (1320 regions of interest). Using these tools, we observed transient hypertrophies not only within key regions controlling gestation and maternal behavior (medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), but also in the amygdala, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Additionally, unlike females exhibiting lower levels of maternal care, highly maternal females developed transient hypertrophies in somatosensory, entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices among other regions. Therefore, coordinated and transient brain modifications associated with maternal performance occurred during gestation and lactation.

Diffusion MRI techniques are widely used to study in vivo changes in the human brain connectome. However, to resolve and characterise white matter fibres in heterogeneous diffusion MRI voxels remains a challenging problem typically approached with signal models that rely on prior information and restrictive constraints. We have recently introduced a 5D relaxation-diffusion correlation framework wherein multidimensional diffusion encoding strategies are used to acquire data at multiple echo-times in order to increase the amount of information encoded into the signal and ease the constraints needed for signal inversion. Nonparametric Monte Carlo inversion of the resulting datasets yields 5D relaxation-diffusion distributions where contributions from different sub-voxel tissue environments are separated with minimal assumptions on their microscopic properties. Here, we build on the 5D correlation approach to derive fibre-specific metrics that can be mapped throughout the imaged brain volume. Distribution components ascribed to fibrous tissues are resolved, and subsequently mapped to a dense mesh of overlapping orientation bins in order to define a smooth orientation distribution function (ODF). Moreover, relaxation and diffusion measures are correlated to each independent ODF coordinate, thereby allowing the estimation of orientation-specific relaxation rates and diffusivities. The proposed method is tested on a healthy volunteer, where the estimated ODFs were observed to capture major WM tracts, resolve fibre crossings, and, more importantly, inform on the relaxation and diffusion features along distinct fibre bundles. If combined with fibre-tracking algorithms, the methodology presented in this work may be useful for investigating the microstructural properties along individual white matter pathways.

The perception and measurement of spatial and temporal dimensions have been widely studied. However whether these two dimensions are processed independently is still being debated. Additionally whether EEG components are uniquely associated with time or space or whether they reflects a more general measure of magnitude remains unknown. While undergoing EEG subjects traveled a randomly predetermined spatial or temporal interval and were then instructed to reproduce the interval traveled. In the task the subjects travel speed varied for the estimation and reproduction phases of each trial so that one dimension could not inform the other. Behaviorally subject performance was more variable when reproducing time than space but overall just as accurate; notably behavior was not correlated between tasks. EEG data revealed during estimation the contingent negative variation (CNV) tracked the probability of the upcoming interval regardless of dimension. However during reproduction the CNV exclusively oriented to the upcoming temporal interval at the start of reproduction. Further a dissociation between relatively early frontal beta and late posterior alpha oscillations was observed for time and space reproduction respectively. Our findings indicate that time and space are neurally separable dimensions yet are hierarchically organized across task contexts within the CNV signal.

Perceptual decision making, as a process of detecting and categorizing information, has been studied extensively over the last two decades. In this study, we investigated the neural characterization of the whole decision-making process by discovering the information processing stages. Such that, the timing and the neural signature of the processing stages were identified for individual trials. The association of stages duration with the stimulus coherency and spatial prioritization factors also revealed the importance of the evidence accumulation process on the speed of the whole decision-making process. We reported that the impact of the stimulus coherency and spatial prioritization on the neural representation of the decision-making process was consistent with the behavioral characterization as well. This study demonstrated that uncovering the cognitive processing stages provided more insights into the decision-making process.

The ability to adjust one's behavioral strategy in complex environments is at the core of cognition. Doing so efficiently requires monitoring the reliability of the ongoing strategy and switching away from it to evaluate alternatives when appropriate. Studies in humans and non-human primates have uncovered signals in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that track the pressure to switch away from the ongoing strategy, and others that relate to the pursuit of alternatives. However, whether these signals underlie computations that actually underpin strategy switching, or merely reflect tracking of related variables remains unclear. Here we provide causal evidence that rodent ACC actively arbitrates between persisting with ongoing behavioral choice and switching away temporarily to re-evaluate alternatives. Furthermore, by individually perturbing distinct output pathways, we establish that the two associated computations-whether to switch away from the current choice, and the pursuit of alternatives-are segregated within ACC micro-circuitry.

Slow-wave sleep, defined by low frequency (&lt;4 Hz) electrical brain activity, is a basic brain function affecting metabolite clearance and memory consolidation. Although the origin of low-frequency activity is related to cortical up and down states, the underlying cellular mechanism of how low-frequency activity becomes effective has remained elusive. We applied electrical stimulation to cultured glial astrocytes while monitored the trafficking of GFP-tagged intracellular vesicles using TIRFM. We found a frequency-dependent effect of electrical stimulation that low-frequency electrical stimulation elevates the mobility of astrocytic intracellular vesicles. We suggest a novel mechanism of brain modulation that electrical signals in the lower range frequencies embedded in brainwaves modulate the functionality of astrocytes for brain homeostasis and memory consolidation. This finding suggests a physiological mechanism whereby endogenous low-frequency brain oscillations enhance astrocytic function that may underlie some of the benefits of slow-wave sleep and highlights possible medical device approach for treating neurological diseases.

Aims: Efficient synaptic communication is crucial to maintain healthy behavioural and cognitive processes. Individuals affected by schizophrenia present behavioural symptoms and alterations in decision-making, suggesting altered synaptic integrity as the support of the illness. It is currently unknown how this synaptic change is mediated in schizophrenia, but microglia have been proposed to act as the culprit, actively removing synapses pathologically. Here, we aimed to explore the interaction between microglia and synaptic uptake in human post-mortem tissue. Methods: We assessed microglial activation and synaptic internalisation by microglia in a post-mortem human tissue of 10 control and 10 schizophrenia cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify microglia (Iba1 and CD68) and the presynaptic terminals (synapsin I). Results: We found no difference in microglial expression, nor a difference in pre-synaptic protein level phagocyted by microglia between the two groups. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the brain imaging studies in schizophrenia implying that microglia play a role mainly during the early phases of the disease, by example in active synapse remodelling, which is not detected in the chronic stage of the illness.

The months between birth and age 2 are increasingly recognized as a period critical for neurodevelopment, with potentially life-long implications for cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the growth trajectories of brain structure and function across this time period. This is in large part because of insufficient approaches to analyze infant MRI scans at different months, especially brain segmentation. Addressing technical gaps in infant brain segmentation would significantly improve our capacity to efficiently measure and identify relevant infant brain structures and connectivity, and their role in long-term development. In this paper, we propose a transfer-learning approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image segmentation architecture, QuickNAT, to segment brain structures for newborns and 6-month infants separately. We pre-trained QuickNAT on auxiliary labels from a large-scale dataset, fine-tuned on manual labels, and then cross-validated the performance on two separate datasets. Compared to other commonly used methods, our transfer-learning approach showed superior segmentation performance on both newborns and 6-month infants. Moreover, we demonstrated improved hippocampus segmentation performance via our approach in preterm infants.

The leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 member A (LRRC8A) is an essential subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is indispensable for cell volume regulation but its broader physiological functions remain a matter of investigation. Astrocyte-targeted Lrrc8a deletion in the nervous system reduces neuronal excitability, impairs synaptic plasticity and memory, and protects against ischemic damage. Here we show that deletion of LRRC8A in all brain cells, using NestinCre -driven Lrrc8afl/fl excision, is lethal. Mice devoid of brain LRRC8A are born close to the expected Mendelian ratio and develop without overt histological abnormalities through the postnatal week 6. Nevertheless, they die in the adolescence, between 5 to 8 weeks of age, with a seizure-like phenotype. Consistent with seizures, we found disruptions in cell excitability, GABAergic signaling, and astrocytic production of the GABA precursor glutamine, all of which might contribute to animal mortality. This work provides the first evidence of a critical role for VRAC in control of brain excitability during brain maturation.

The retina has one of the highest energy demands in the human body, and proper regulation of metabolism among the cell types of the retina is required for functional vision. Recent studies have reported that retinal metabolism is disrupted during retinal degeneration and aging, while therapies designed to enhance metabolism can slow or prevent degeneration. Here, we show that multiple metabolic pathways, including those regulated by a key ATP sensor and regulator of metabolism, AMP-activated-kinase (AMPK), were dysregulated in a model of inherited retinal degeneration. In order to assess the direct role of AMPK in regulating retinal metabolism, we used mice with retina-specific knockout of AMPK activity. Conditional loss of AMPK resulted in impaired visual function at an early age, with slow photoreceptor loss observed in older mice. Moreover, we found that loss of AMPK resulted in decreased metabolic flux from glucose, decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number, decreased mitochondrial-related gene expression, and alterations in mitochondrial morphology in the photoreceptors, all of which preceded degeneration. Surprisingly, metabolic changes from the loss of AMPK in retinal neurons also resulted in secondary degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Together, these data show that AMPK signaling is important for maintaining metabolic homeostasis of the retina and support the hypothesis that photoreceptors and RPE have a shared metabolic ecosystem that is controlled, in part, by AMPK.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to the upper limb, lower limb distal nerve transfer (DNT) outcomes are poor, likely due to the longer length of regeneration required. DNT surgery to treat foot drop entails rerouting a tibial nerve branch to the denervated common fibular nerve stump to reinnervate the tibialis anterior muscle to ankle dorsiflexion. Conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) prior to a nerve repair surgery accelerates nerve regeneration and promotes sensorimotor recovery. We hypothesize that CES prior to DNT will promote nerve regeneration to restore ankle dorsiflexion.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One week following common fibular nerve crush, CES was delivered to the tibial nerve in half the animals and at two weeks, all animals received a DNT. To investigate the effects of CES on nerve regeneration, a series of kinetic, kinematic, skilled locomotion, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical outcomes were assessed. The effects of CES on the nerve were investigated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CES treated animals had significantly accelerated nerve regeneration (p&lt;0.001) and they had accelerated walking speed with improved skilled locomotion. The injured limb had greater vertical peak forces, with improved duty factor, near‐complete recovery of braking, propulsive forces and dorsiflexion (p&lt;0.01). Reinnervation of the tibialis anterior muscle was confirmed with nerve conduction studies and immunohistochemical analysis of the neuromuscular junction. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CES does not induce Wallerian degeneration nor does it cause macrophage infiltration of the distal tibial nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tibial nerve CES prior to DNT significantly improved functional recovery of the common fibular nerve and its muscle targets without inducing injury to the donor nerve.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub> can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kß is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kß is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kß co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7 and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ+ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared to ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ+ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.</p>

Abstract
<p>Membrane voltage oscillations in layer 1 (L1) of primary sensory cortices might be important indicators of cortical gain control, attentional focusing, and signal integration. However, electric field recordings are hampered by the low seal resistance of electrodes close to the brain surface. To study L1 membrane voltage oscillations, we synthesized a new voltage-sensitive dye, di1-ANNINE (anellated hemicyanine)-6plus, that can diffuse into tissue. We applied it with a new surgery, leaving the dura intact but allowing injection of large quantities of staining solution, and imaged cortical membrane potential oscillations with two-photon microscopy depth-resolved (25–100 μm below dura) in anesthetized and awake mice. We found delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–10 Hz), low beta (10–20 Hz), and low gamma (30–40 Hz) oscillations. All oscillations were stronger in awake animals. While the power of delta, theta, and low beta oscillations increased with depth, the power of low gamma was more constant throughout L1. These findings identify L1 as an important coordination hub for the dynamic binding process of neurons mediated by oscillations.</p>

Abstract
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator <i>MECP2</i>. We previously identified aberrant NF-B pathway upregulation in brains of <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice and demonstrated that genetically attenuating NF-B rescues some characteristic neuronal RTT phenotypes. These results raised the intriguing question of whether NF-B pathway inhibitors might provide a therapeutic avenue in RTT. Here, we investigate whether the known NF-B pathway inhibitor vitamin D ameliorates neuronal phenotypes in <i>Mecp2</i>-mutant mice. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among RTT patients, and we find that <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice similarly have significantly reduced 25(OH)D serum levels compared with wild-type littermates. We identify that vitamin D rescues aberrant NF-B pathway activation and reduced neurite outgrowth of <i>Mecp2</i> knock-down cortical neurons <i>in vitro</i>. Further, dietary supplementation with vitamin D in early symptomatic male <i>Mecp2</i> hemizygous null and female <i>Mecp2</i> heterozygous mice ameliorates reduced neocortical dendritic morphology and soma size phenotypes and modestly improves reduced lifespan of <i>Mecp2</i>-nulls. These results elucidate fundamental neurobiology of RTT and provide foundation that NF-B pathway inhibition might be a therapeutic target for RTT.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23213?af=R">The history of long‐term potentiation as a memory mechanism: Controversies, confirmation, and some lessons to remember</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.</p>

<p>The neurodiagnostic criteria of Leigh syndrome have not yet been clearly redefined based on the expanding of molecular etiologies. We aimed to analyze twenty years of clinical, genetic, and magnetic resonance studies from our Leigh syndrome cohort to provide a detailed description of central nervous system lesions in Leigh syndrome and their biological evolution in view of their genetic and clinical findings. Our study adds new neurodiagnostic insights to the current knowledge of Leigh syndrome, including association with overlapping syndromes, and the correlation of pathogenic genetic variants with neuroimaging phenotypes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R">Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among risk and prodromal markers, physical activity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical activity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical activity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation were highest in individuals with the <i>Firmicutes </i>‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the <i>Prevotella </i>‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical activity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.</p>

<p>Background: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show eye movement abnormalities and frequently complain about difficulties in reading. So far, it is unclear whether basal ganglia dysfunction or cognitive impairment has a greater impact on eye movements during reading.</p><p>Objective: To analyze eye movement behavior during a natural reading task with respect to cognitive state and dopaminergic therapy in PD and healthy controls.</p><p>Methods: Eye movements of 59 PD patients and 29 age- and education-matched healthy controls were recorded during mute, self-paced reading of a text. 25 cognitively normal PD patients performed the task additionally in off medication state. Clinical assessment included a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and the motor section of MDS—Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).</p><p>Results: PD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 21 patients. Reading speed was significantly reduced in PD-MCI compared to healthy controls and PD patients without MCI due to higher numbers of progressive saccades. Cognitively intact PD patients showed no significant alterations of reading speed or eye movement pattern during reading. The fixation duration tended to be prolonged in PD compared to healthy controls and decreased significantly after levodopa intake. Scores for executive functions, attention, and language correlated with reading speed in the PD group.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study is the first to reveal (1) reduced reading speed with altered reading pattern in PD with MCI and (2) a relevant impact of levodopa on fixation duration during reading in PD. Further research is needed to determine whether therapeutic interventions, e.g., levodopa or neuropsychological training, improve the subjective reading experience for patients with PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57656">Aberrant subchondral osteoblastic metabolism modifies NaV1.8 for osteoarthritis</a></h4>

Pain is the most prominent symptom of osteoarthritis (OA) progression. However, the relationship between pain and OA progression remains largely unknown. Here we report osteoblast secret prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during aberrant subchondral bone remodeling induces pain and OA progression in mice. Specific deletion of the major PGE2 producing enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in osteoblasts or PGE2 receptor EP4 in peripheral nerve markedly ameliorates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, PGE2 sensitizes dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by modifying the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, evidenced by that genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in DRG neurons can substantially attenuate OA. Moreover, drugs targeting aberrant subchondral bone remodeling also attenuates OA through rebalancing PGE2 production and Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 modification. Thus, aberrant subchondral remodeling induced Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 neuronal modification is an important player in OA and is a potential therapeutic target in multiple skeletal degenerative diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56626">Addressing selective reporting of experiments through predefined exclusion criteria</a></h4>

The pressure for every research article to tell a clear story often leads researchers in the life sciences to exclude experiments that 'did not work' when they write up their results. However, this practice can lead to reporting bias if the decisions about which experiments to exclude are taken after data have been collected and analyzed. Here we discuss how to balance clarity and thoroughness when reporting the results of research, and suggest that predefining the criteria for excluding experiments might help researchers to achieve this balance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56096">Oomycete small RNAs bind to the plant RNA-induced silencing complex for virulence</a></h4>

The exchange of small RNAs (sRNAs) between hosts and pathogens can lead to gene silencing in the recipient organism, a mechanism termed cross-kingdom RNAi (ck-RNAi). While fungal sRNAs promoting virulence are established, the significance of ck-RNAi in distinct plant pathogens is not clear. Here, we describe that sRNAs of the pathogen <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i>, which represents the kingdom of oomycetes and is phylogenetically distant from fungi, employ the host plant's Argonaute (AGO)/RNA-induced silencing complex for virulence. To demonstrate <i>H. arabidopsidis</i> sRNA (<i>Hpa</i>sRNA) functionality in ck-RNAi, we designed a novel CRISPR endoribonuclease Csy4/GUS reporter that enabled <i>in situ</i> visualization of <i>Hpa</i>sRNA-induced target suppression in Arabidopsis. The significant role of <i>Hpa</i>sRNAs together with <i>At</i>AGO1 in virulence was revealed in plant<i> atago1</i> mutants and by transgenic Arabidopsis expressing a short-tandem-target-mimic to block <i>Hpa</i>sRNAs, that both exhibited enhanced resistance. <i>Hpa</i>sRNA-targeted plant genes contributed to host immunity, as Arabidopsis gene knockout mutants displayed quantitative enhanced susceptibility.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55325">Parallel CRISPR-Cas9 screens clarify impacts of p53 on screen performance</a></h4>

CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering has revolutionised high-throughput functional genomic screens. However, recent work has raised concerns regarding the performance of CRISPR-Cas9 screens using <i>TP53</i> wild-type human cells due to a p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) limiting the efficiency of generating viable edited cells. To directly assess the impact of cellular p53 status on CRISPR-Cas9 screen performance, we carried out parallel CRISPR-Cas9 screens in wild-type and <i>TP53</i> knockout human retinal pigment epithelial cells using a focused dual guide RNA library targeting 852 DDR-associated genes. Our work demonstrates that although functional p53 status negatively affects identification of significantly depleted genes, optimal screen design can nevertheless enable robust screen performance. Through analysis of our own and published screen data, we highlight key factors for successful screens in both wild-type and p53-deficient cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55286">Measuring ligand-cell surface receptor affinities with axial line-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy</a></h4>

Development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms is largely controlled by complex cell-cell signaling networks that rely on specific binding of secreted ligands to cell surface receptors. The Wnt signaling network, as an example, involves multiple ligands and receptors to elicit specific cellular responses. To understand the mechanisms of such a network, ligand-receptor interactions should be characterized quantitatively, ideally in live cells or tissues. Such measurements are possible using fluorescence microscopy yet challenging due to sample movement, low signal-to-background ratio and photobleaching. Here we present a robust approach based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with ultra-high speed axial line scanning, yielding precise equilibrium dissociation coefficients of interactions in the Wnt signaling pathway. Using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to endogenously tag receptors with fluorescent proteins, we demonstrate that the method delivers precise results even with low, near-native amounts of receptors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53226">Identification of a super-functional Tfh-like subpopulation in murine lupus by pattern perception</a></h4>

Dysregulated cytokine expression by T cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. However, the identification of the corresponding pathogenic subpopulations is a challenge, since a distinction between physiological variation and a new quality in the expression of protein markers requires combinatorial evaluation. Here, we were able to identify a super-functional follicular helper T cell (Tfh)-like subpopulation in lupus-prone NZBxW mice with our binning approach "pattern recognition of immune cells (PRI)". PRI uncovered a subpopulation of IL-21<sup>+</sup> IFN-g<sup>high</sup> PD-1<sup>low</sup> CD40L<sup>high</sup> CXCR5<sup>- </sup>Bcl-6<sup>- </sup>T cells specifically expanded in diseased mice. In addition, these cells express high levels of TNF-a and IL-2, and provide B cell help for IgG production in an IL-21 and CD40L dependent manner. This super-functional T cell subset might be a superior driver of autoimmune processes due to a polyfunctional and high cytokine expression combined with Tfh-like properties.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51358">A viral fusogen hijacks the actin cytoskeleton to drive cell-cell fusion</a></h4>

Cell-cell fusion, which is essential for tissue development and used by some viruses to form pathological syncytia, is typically driven by fusogenic membrane proteins with tall (&gt;10 nm) ectodomains that undergo conformational changes to bring apposing membranes in close contact prior to fusion. Here we report that a viral fusogen with a short (&lt;2 nm) ectodomain, the reptilian orthoreovirus p14, accomplishes the same task by hijacking the actin cytoskeleton. We show that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of p14 triggers N-WASP-mediated assembly of a branched actin network. Using p14 mutants, we demonstrate that fusion is abrogated when binding of an adaptor protein is prevented and that direct coupling of the fusogenic ectodomain to branched actin assembly is sufficient to drive cell-cell fusion. This work reveals how the actin cytoskeleton can be harnessed to overcome energetic barriers to cell-cell fusion.

Author summary: Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XKbc_sdLRPQ" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The aging brain is characterized by neural dedifferentiation, an apparent decrease in the functional selectivity of category-selective cortical regions. Age-related reductions in neural differentiation have been proposed to play a causal role in cognitive aging. Recent findings suggest, however, that age-related dedifferentiation is not equally evident for all stimulus categories and, additionally, that the relationship between neural differentiation and cognitive performance is not moderated by age. In light of these findings, in the present experiment, younger and older human adults (males and females) underwent fMRI as they studied words paired with images of scenes or faces before a subsequent memory task. Neural selectivity was measured in two scene-selective (parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)] and two face-selective [fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA)] regions using both a univariate differentiation index and multivoxel pattern similarity analysis. Both methods provided highly convergent results, which revealed evidence of age-related reductions in neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective but not face-selective cortical regions. Additionally, neural differentiation in the PPA demonstrated a positive, age-invariant relationship with subsequent source memory performance (recall of the image category paired with each recognized test word). These findings extend prior findings suggesting that age-related neural dedifferentiation is not a ubiquitous phenomenon, and that the specificity of neural responses to scenes is predictive of subsequent memory performance independently of age.</p>

<p>Rhodopsin is mislocalized to the inner segment plasma membrane (IS PM) in various blinding disorders including autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by class I rhodopsin mutations. In these disorders, rhodopsin-laden microvesicles are secreted into the extracellular milieu by afflicted photoreceptor cells. Using a <i>Xenopus laevis</i> model expressing class I mutant rhodopsin or Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) fused to Dendra2, we fluorescently labeled the microvesicles and found retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are capable of engulfing microvesicles containing rhodopsin. A unique sorting mechanism allows class I mutant rhodopsin, but not NKA, to be packaged into the microvesicles. Under normal physiological conditions, NKA is not shed as microvesicles to the extracellular space, but is degraded intracellularly. Those studies provide novel insights into protein homeostasis in the photoreceptor IS PM.</p>

Abstract
<p>Glutamate transporters, particularly glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), help to prevent the adverse effects associated with glutamate toxicity by rapidly clearing glutamate from the extracellular space. Since GLT-1 expression and/or function are reduced in many neurodegenerative diseases, upregulation of GLT-1 is a favorable approach to treat the symptoms of these diseases. Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic reported to increase GLT-1 expression, can exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases; however, many of these diseases do not exhibit uniform brain pathology. In contrast, as a drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, ceftriaxone administration is likely to increase GLT-1 levels globally throughout the neuroaxis. In Huntington disease (HD), low GLT-1 expression is observed in the striatum in postmortem tissue and animal models. While ceftriaxone was reported to increase striatal GLT-1 and ameliorate the motor symptoms in a mouse model of HD, the extrastriatal effects of ceftriaxone in HD are unknown. Using electrophysiology and high-speed imaging of the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR, we quantified real-time glutamate dynamics and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of the Q175FDN mouse model of HD, following intraperitoneal injections of either saline or ceftriaxone. We observed an activity-dependent increase in extracellular glutamate accumulation within the HD hippocampus, which was not the result of reduced GLT-1 expression. Surprisingly, ceftriaxone had little effect on glutamate clearance rates and negatively impacted synaptic plasticity. These data provide evidence for glutamate dysregulation in the HD hippocampus but also caution the use of ceftriaxone as a treatment for HD.</p>

Abstract
<p>Natural genetic variants of Neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its cognate receptor ErbB4 are associated with a risk for schizophrenia. Whereas most studies on NRG1-ErbB4 signaling have focused on GABAergic interneurons, ErbB4 is also expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons where it modulates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Here, we report that extracellular steady-state levels of DA are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; –65%), hippocampus (–53%) and nucleus accumbens (NAc; –35%), but are elevated in the dorsal striatum (+25%) of ErbB4 knock-out mice (ErbB4 KOs) relative to wild-type controls. This pattern of DA imbalance recapitulates the reported prefrontal cortical reduction and striatal increase of DA levels in schizophrenia patients. Next, we report on a battery of behavioral tasks used to evaluate locomotor, cognitive and motivational behaviors in ErbB4 KOs relative to controls. We found that ErbB4 KOs are hyperactive in a novel open field but not in their familiar home cage, are more sensitive to amphetamine, perform poorly in the T-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks, exhibit reduced spatial learning and memory on the Barnes maze, and perform markedly worse in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks when associating cued-reward palatable food with location. However, we found that the poor performance of ErbB4 KOs in CPP are likely due to deficits in spatial memory, instead of reward seeking, as ErbB4 KOs are more motivated to work for palatable food rewards. Our findings indicate that ErbB4 signaling affects tonic DA levels and modulates a wide array of behavioral deficits relevant to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.</p>

Abstract
<p>Substance use disorders have a complex etiology. Genetics, the environment, and behavior all play a role in the initiation, escalation, and relapse of drug use. Recently, opioid use disorder has become a national health crisis. One aspect of opioid addiction that has yet to be fully examined is the effects of alterations of the microbiome and gut-brain axis signaling on central nervous system activity during opioid intoxication and withdrawal. The effect of microbiome depletion on the activation of neuronal ensembles was measured by detecting Fos-positive (Fos+) neuron activation during intoxication and withdrawal using a rat model of oxycodone dependence. Daily oxycodone administration (2 mg/kg) increased pain thresholds and increased Fos+ neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during intoxication, with a decrease in pain thresholds and increase in Fos+ neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), locus coeruleus (LC), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), agranular insular cortex (AI), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and lateral habenula medial parvocellular region during withdrawal. Microbiome depletion produced widespread but region- and state-specific changes in neuronal ensemble activation. Oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal also increased functional connectivity among brain regions. Microbiome depletion resulted in a decorrelation of this functional network. These data indicate that microbiome depletion by antibiotics produces widespread changes in the recruitment of neuronal ensembles that are activated by oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal, suggesting that the gut microbiome may play a role in opioid use and dependence. Future studies are needed to better understand the molecular, neurobiological, and behavioral effects of microbiome depletion on addiction-like behaviors.</p>

Abstract
<p>As they interact with their environment and encounter challenges, animals adjust their behavior on a moment-to-moment basis to maintain task fitness. This dynamic process of adaptive motor control occurs in the nervous system, but an understanding of the biomechanics of the body is essential to properly interpret the behavioral outcomes. To study how animals respond to changing task conditions, we used a model system in which the functional roles of identified neurons and the relevant biomechanics are well understood and can be studied in intact behaving animals: feeding in the marine mollusc <i>Aplysia</i>. We monitored the motor neuronal output of the feeding circuitry as intact animals fed on uniform food stimuli under unloaded and loaded conditions, and we measured the force of retraction during loaded swallows. We observed a previously undescribed pattern of force generation, which can be explained within the appropriate biomechanical context by the activity of just a few key, identified motor neurons. We show that, when encountering load, animals recruit identified retractor muscle motor neurons for longer and at higher frequency to increase retraction force duration. Our results identify a mode by which animals robustly adjust behavior to their environment, which is experimentally tractable to further mechanistic investigation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Action video gaming can promote neural plasticity. Short-term monocular patching drives neural plasticity in the visual system of human adults. For instance, short-term monocular patching of 0.5–5 h briefly enhances the patched eye’s contribution in binocular vision (i.e., short-term ocular dominance plasticity). In this study, we investigate whether action video gaming can influence this plasticity in adults with normal vision. We measured participants’ eye dominance using a binocular phase combination task before and after 2.5 h of monocular patching. Participants were asked to play action video games, watch action video game movies, or play non-action video games during the period of monocular patching. We found that participants’ change of ocular dominance after monocular patching was not significantly different either for playing action video games versus watching action video game movies (Comparison 1) or for playing action video games versus playing non-action video games (Comparison 2). These results suggest that action video gaming does not either boost or eliminate short-term ocular dominance plasticity, and that the neural site for this type of plasticity might be in the early visual pathway.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) at immediate, 30‐minute, and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of NREM sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors, such as age and epilepsy duration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30 minutes and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13 minutes was associated with impaired memory retention over 1 week.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in the hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:976–987 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features, such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate, such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (<i>p </i> = 0.02), including but not limited to chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (<i>C9orf72 </i>) repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (<i>p </i> = 0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:950–961 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear whether retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The estimated proportion of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in multiple sclerosis (MS) attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/yr, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/yr, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:−0.09 ± 0.04%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.03; ONL:−0.12 ± 0.06%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:−0.10 ± 0.04%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.01; ONL:−0.13 ± 0.05%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.01), whereas they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:885–896 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non‐motor DBS effects is not well‐characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS, which have been reported to improve, worsen, or remain unchanged.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 patients with PD from 3 DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, and Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as the test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fibers connecting the electrode with left prefrontal areas were associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:962–975 </b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R">Extra‐Axial Inflammatory Signal in Parameninges in Migraine with Visual Aura</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).</p>
<p>Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used simultaneously acquired <sup>11</sup>C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:939–949 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (<i>p </i> = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (<i>p </i> for interaction = 0.73).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:931–938 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain magnetic resonance imaging to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: <i>p </i> = 0.001; left: <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001; left: <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), putamen (right: <i>p </i> = 0.001; left: <i>p </i> = 0.001), and angular gyrus (right: <i>p </i> = 0.011; left: <i>p </i> = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (<i>p </i> = 0.010), caudate (<i>p </i> = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (<i>p </i> = 0.004), and supramarginal gyrus (<i>p </i> = 0.003). The other respiratory variables—lowest oxygen saturation, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation &lt; 90%, apnea–hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index—did not show any significant association with brain volumes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:921–930 </b></p>

<p>Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicate that exposure to nicotine during development, separated from the effects of smoking tobacco, can contribute to dysregulation of brain development including behavioral deficits. An RNAseq study of human fetal cerebral cortex demonstrated that 9 out of 16 genes for human nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunits are selectively expressed between 7.5 and 12 post-conceptional weeks (PCW). The most highly expressed subunit genes were CHNRA4 and CHNRB2, whose protein products combine to form the most ubiquitous functional receptor isoform expressed in the adult brain. They exhibited correlated expression in both RNAseq samples, and in tissue sections by in situ hybridization. Co-localization studies with other cortical markers suggest they are pre-dominantly expressed by post-mitotic glutamatergic neuron pre-cursors in both cortical plate and pre-subplate, rather than cortical progenitor cells or GABAergic interneuron pre-cursors. However, GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells in the ganglionic eminences do express these sub-units. CHNRA5 also showed moderate levels of expression and again favored post-mitotic neurons. Other subunits, e.g., CHRNA7, exhibited low but detectable levels of expression. CHRN genes found not to be expressed included genes for subunits usually considered muscle specific, e.g., CHNRA1, although some muscle specific gene expression was detected, for instance CHNRB1. Although there is little or no synthesis of acetylcholine by intrinsic cortical neurons, cholinergic fibers from basal forebrain innervate the cerebral cortex from 12 PCW at the latest. Acetylcholine may have a paracrine effect on radially migrating cortical neurons and GABAergic interneuron progenitors.</p>

<p>Background: We aimed to identify the functional brain networks involved in the regulation of visual accommodation by contrasting the cortical functional areas evoked by foveal fixation to an “E” target, which were subservient to the accommodation responses to a -3/-6 diopter stimulus.</p><p>Methods: Neural activity was assessed in healthy volunteers by changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five right-handed subjects viewed the “E” target presented in a hierarchical block design. They participated in two monocular tasks: (i) sustained foveal fixation upon an “E” target on a white background at 33 cm (-3.03D accommodative demand); and (ii) sustained fixation through an attached -3D concave lens (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye; each condition cycled through a standard alternating 30-s eye open/30-s eye closed design to provide the BOLD contrast. The total sustained period was 480 s.</p><p>Results: The contrast between the -3D and the rest condition revealed activation in the occipital lobe (Lingual gyrus, Cuneus, Calcarine_L, and Calcarine_R); cerebellum (Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Cerebellum_6_L); precentral lobe (Precentral_R); frontal lobe (Frontal_Inf_Oper_R and Frontal_Mid_R); and cingulate cortex (Cingulum_Ant_L). With the -3D concave lenses (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye, the voxel size and peak intensity of activation in the occipital lobe and cerebellum were greater than with the -3D accommodative demand; emergent activated brain areas included the parietal lobe (bilateral precuneus gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus); the precentral lobe and cingulate cortex failed to reach the threshold in the -6D vs. rest contrast. In the -3D and -6D contrast comparison, the frontal lobe (Frontal_Sup_Medial_L) and parietal lobe (Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R) passed the significance threshold of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction. The mean activation in the -3D and -6D contrast revealed an incremental summation of the activations than that found in the previous -3D vs. rest and -6D vs. rest comparisons.</p><p>Conclusions: Neural circuits were selectively activated during the -3D/-6D accommodative response to blur cues. Cognitive-perceptual processing is involved in signal regulation of ocular accommodative functions.</p>

<p>Young neurons in the adult brain are key to some types of learning and memory. They integrate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus contributing to such cognitive processes following timely developmental events. While experimentally impairing GABAergic transmission through the blockade or elimination of the ionic cotransporter NKCC1 leads to alterations in the proper maturation of young neurons, it is still unknown if the in vivo administration of common use diuretic drugs that block the cotransporter, alters the development of young hippocampal neurons and affects DG-related functions. In this study, we delivered chronically and intracerebroventricularly the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide to young-adult rats. We analyzed doublecortin density and development parameters (apical dendrite length and angle and dendritic arbor length) in doublecortin positive neurons from different subregions in the DG and evaluated the performance of animals in contextual fear learning and memory. Our results show that in bumetanide-treated subjects, doublecortin density is diminished in the infra and suprapyramidal blades of the DG; the length of primary dendrites is shortened in the infrapyramidal blade and; the growth angle of primary dendrites in the infrapyramidal blade is different from control animals. Behaviorally, treated animals showed the typical learning curve in a contextual fear task, and freezing-time displayed during contextual fear memory was not different from controls. Thus, in vivo icv delivery of bumetanide negatively alters DCX density associated to young neurons and its proper development but not to the extent of affecting a DG dependent task as aversive context learning and memory.</p>

<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disease. Autoantibodies, cellular immunity, complement, and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MG. It is characterized by the dysfunction of neuromuscular junction transmission and skeletal muscle weakness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small molecule ribonucleic acids that regulate various biological processes (e.g., development, differentiation, and immunity) at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of gene expression. miRNAs play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including MG. In recent studies, the functional mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG have received increasing attention. miRNAs are highly stable and have high specificity in peripheral body fluids. Therefore, the miRNAs in body fluids may represent promising biomarkers for determining the prognosis of MG and the efficacy of treatment. This article reviews the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG, highlights the potential of miRNAs as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MG, and deepens our understanding of disease processes.</p>

<p>It is becoming increasingly accepted that there is an interplay between the peripheral immune response and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in the leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with familial and sporadic cases of PD but are also found in immune-related disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and leprosy. Furthermore, LRRK2 has been associated with bacterial infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium. Recent evidence suggests a role of LRRK2 in the regulation of the immune system and modulation of inflammatory responses, at a systemic level, with LRRK2 functionally implicated in both the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. It has therefore been suggested that peripheral immune signaling may play an important role in the regulation of neurodegeneration in LRRK2 as well as non-LRRK2-associated PD. This review will discuss the current evidence for this hypothesis and will provide compelling rationale for placing LRRK2 at the interface between peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Recent advances in deep learning have improved the segmentation accuracy of subcortical brain structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of many neurological disorders. However, most existing deep learning based approaches in neuroimaging do not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the subnuclei of the amygdala. To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to harmonize multi-site MRI data, and show that our method generalizes well to challenging traumatic brain injury (TBI) datasets collected from multiple centers. This appears to be a promising strategy for image segmentation for multiple site studies and increased morphological variability from significant brain pathology.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating gait disorder in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). While various neuroimaging techniques have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of FOG, changes in corticomotor excitability associated with FOG have yet to be determined. Research to date has not concluded if changes in corticomotor excitability are associated with gait disturbances in this patient population. This study aimed to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticomotor excitability changes associated with FOG. Furthermore, the relationship between corticomotor excitability and gait performances would be determined.</p>Methods<p>Eighteen participants with PD and FOG (PD + FOG), 15 without FOG (PD − FOG), and 15 non-disabled adults (Control) were recruited for this study. Single and paired-pulse TMS paradigms were used to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, respectively. Gait performance was measured by the 10-Meter-Walk test. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TMS outcomes and gait parameters.</p>Results<p>Compared with the Control group, the PD + FOG group showed a significantly lower resting motor threshold and reduced short intracortical inhibition (SICI). Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between resting motor evoked potential and step length, and between SICI and walking velocity in the Control group. While the silent period correlated with step length in the PD − FOG group, no significant relationship was observed in the PD + FOG group.</p>Discussion and Conclusion<p>Compared to the Control group, the PD + FOG group exhibited reduced corticomotor inhibition. Distinct correlations observed among the three groups suggest that the function of the corticomotor system plays an important role in mediating walking ability in non-disabled adults and people with PD − FOG, while people with PD + FOG may rely on neural networks other than the corticomotor system to control gait.</p>

<p>Empathy influences how we perceive, understand, and interact with our social environment. Previous studies suggested a network of different brain regions as a neural substrate for empathy, including, in particular, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, a contribution of the somatosensory cortices for this empathy related network has been suggested. This is remarkable, given that other recent studies have revealed a role for the somatosensory cortex in various social tasks. For example, in experiments using tactile priming, incidental haptic sensations are found to influence judgment recommendations. Here, we aimed to test if this engagement of the somatosensory cortices during tactile priming can be predicted by the participant’s empathy personality traits. We assessed participant’s empathy and personality traits by means of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and NEO-FFI and tested whether trait empathy is associated with the tactile priming effect in social judgments. Results revealed that empathy predicted the tactile priming effect negatively. This was accompanied by a reduced engagement of the somatosensory cortex, which has been shown to be associated with the priming effect. We conclude that empathy seems to protect people from tactile priming effects.</p>

<p>In humans and experimental animals, the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reduces food intake and body weight. To gain further insights into the mechanism(s) underlying its satiety effect, we: (i) evaluated the CNTF-dependent activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in mouse models where neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons can be identified by green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (ii) assessed whether CNTF promotes leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers. Immunohistochemical experiments enabled us to establish that intraperitoneal injection of mouse recombinant CNTF activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in a substantial proportion of arcuate nucleus (ARC) NPY neurons (18.68% ± 0.60 in 24-h fasted mice and 25.50% ± 1.17 in fed mice) but exerted a limited effect on POMC neurons (4.15% ± 0.33 in 24-h fasted mice and 2.84% ± 0.45 in fed mice). CNTF-responsive NPY neurons resided in the ventromedial ARC, facing the median eminence (ME), and were surrounded by albumin immunoreactivity, suggesting that they are located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In both normally fed and high-fat diet (HFD) obese animals, CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in ME β1- and β2-tanycytes, an effect that has been linked to the promotion of leptin entry into the brain. Accordingly, compared to the animals treated with leptin, mice treated with leptin/CNTF showed: (i) a significantly greater leptin content in hypothalamic protein extracts; (ii) a significant increase in phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3)-positive neurons in the ARC and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus of normally fed mice; and (iii) a significantly increased number of P-STAT3-positive neurons in the ARC and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of HFD obese mice. Collectively, these data suggest that exogenously administered CNTF reduces food intake by exerting a leptin-like action on distinctive NPY ARC neurons and by promoting leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers.</p>

<p>Microglia, the innate immune effector cells of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the development, homeostasis, and pathology of CNS. Microglia become activated in response to various insults and injuries and protect the CNS by phagocytosing the invading pathogens, dead neurons, and other cellular debris. Recent studies have demonstrated that the epigenetic mechanisms ensure the coordinated regulation of genes involved in microglial activation. In this study, we performed a microRNA (miRNA) microarray in activated primary microglia derived from rat pup’s brain and identified differentially expressed miRNAs targeting key genes involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, miR-142-3p, one of the highly up-regulated miRNAs in microglia upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation, compared to untreated primary microglia cells was predicted to target Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin dependent kinase 2a (CAMK2A). Further, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-142-3p targets the 3′UTR of Camk2a. CAMK2A has been implicated in regulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning. Given this, this study further focused on understanding the miR-142-3p mediated regulation of the CAMK2A-BDNF pathway via Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in activated microglia. The results revealed that CAMK2A was downregulated in activated microglia, suggesting an inverse relationship between miR-142-3p and Camk2a in activated microglia. Overexpression of miR-142-3p in microglia was found to decrease the expression of CAMK2A and subsequently BDNF through regulation of CREB phosphorylation. Functional analysis through shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of CAMK2A in microglia confirmed that the regulation of BDNF by miR-142-3p is via CAMK2A. Overall, this study provides a database of differentially expressed miRNAs in activated primary microglia and reveals that microglial miR-142-3p regulates the CAMK2A-CREB-BDNF pathway which is involved in synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a severely limited regeneration capacity. Comparison with lower species like amphibians, which are able to restore even complex tissues after damage, indicates the presence of an inhibitory environment that restricts the cellular response in mammals. In this context, signals provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important regulators of events like cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation or neurite outgrowth. Therefore, knowledge of the post-lesional ECM and of cells that produce these factors might support development of new treatment strategies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury and other types of CNS damage. In the present study, we analyzed the surround of focal infrared laser lesions of the adult mouse visual cortex. This lesion paradigm avoids direct contact with the brain, as the laser beam passes the intact bone. Cell type-specific markers revealed a distinct spatial distribution of different astroglial subtypes in the penumbra after injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as marker for reactive astrocytes was found broadly up-regulated, whereas the more immature markers vimentin and nestin were only expressed by a subset of cells. Dividing astrocytes could be identified via the proliferation marker Ki-67. Different ECM molecules, among others the neural stem cell-associated glycoprotein tenascin-C and the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate epitope, were found on astrocytes in the penumbra. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and aggrecan as markers for perineuronal nets, a specialized ECM limiting synaptic plasticity, appeared normal in the vicinity of the necrotic lesion core. In sum, expression of progenitor markers by astrocyte subpopulations and the identification of proliferating astrocytes in combination with an ECM that contains components typically associated with neural stem/progenitor cells suggest that an immature cell fate is facilitated as response to the injury.</p>

<p>Introduction: Studies have shown that excess formaldehyde accumulation in the brain accelerates cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, reports from our research team revealed that red light treatment (RLT) improved memory in AD mice by activating formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and thus reducing formaldehyde levels. Here, we developed a medical RLT device to investigate the safety and efficacy of this device in older adults with mild to moderate AD.</p><p>Methods: This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will include 60 participants who will be recruited and randomly divided into an RLT group and a control group. The RLT group will receive RLT intervention 5 days a week for 30 min each time for 24 weeks while the control group will continue their routine treatments without RLT. All participants will undergo neuropsychological and functional assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Barthel Index at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. All participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and blood/urine biomarkers tests at baseline and 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the ADAS-cog score while the secondary outcomes will be the GDS and NPI scores. Adverse events will be recorded and treated when necessary. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RLT.</p><p>Discussion: This protocol outlines the objectives of the study and explained the RLT device developed by the research team. The study is designed as an RCT to evaluate the safety and effects of the RLT device on older adults with mild to moderate AD. This study will provide evidence for the clinical use of RLT on treatment for AD.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR1800020163; Pre-results.</p>

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study, we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF) tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (ΔHbO) in the region of interest, ΔHbO maps at 13 specific time points (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean, three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually, after training the CNN model with ΔHbO maps and temporal feature maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46, 87.80, and 90.37%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61% was achieved from the ΔHbO slope map during 20–60 s interval of N-back tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to identify MCI from their patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53706">A moth odorant receptor highly expressed in the ovipositor is involved in detecting host-plant volatiles</a></h4>

Antennae are often considered to be the nostrils of insects. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of the pheromone gland-ovipositor complex of <i>Helicoverpa assulta</i> and discovered that an odorant receptor (OR) gene, <i>HassOR31</i>, had much higher expression in the ovipositor than in antennae or other tissues. To determine whether the ovipositor was involved in odorant detection, we co-expressed <i>HassOR31</i> and its co-receptor, <i>HassORco</i>, in a <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte model system, and demonstrated that the OR was responsive to 12 plant odorants, especially Z-3-hexenyl butyrate. These odorants elicited electrophysiological responses of some sensilla in the ovipositor, and <i>HassOR31</i> and <i>HassORco</i> were co-expressed within ovipositor sensilla. Two oviposition preference experiments showed that female moths lacking antennae still preferentially selected oviposition sites containing plant volatiles. We suggest that the expression of <i>HassOR31</i> in the ovipositor of <i>H. assulta</i> helps females to determine precise egg-laying sites in host plants.

Previously we showed that YAP/TAZ promote not only proliferation but also differentiation of immature Schwann cells (SCs), thereby forming and maintaining the myelin sheath around peripheral axons (Grove et al., 2017). Here we show that YAP/TAZ are required for mature SCs to restore peripheral myelination, but not to proliferate, after nerve injury. We find that YAP/TAZ dramatically disappear from SCs of adult mice concurrent with axon degeneration after nerve injury. They reappear in SCs only if axons regenerate. YAP/TAZ ablation does not impair SC proliferation or transdifferentiation into growth promoting repair SCs. SCs lacking YAP/TAZ, however, fail to upregulate myelin-associated genes and completely fail to remyelinate regenerated axons. We also show that both YAP and TAZ are redundantly required for optimal remyelination. These findings suggest that axons regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs and that YAP/TAZ are essential for functional regeneration of peripheral nerve.

<p>by Martí Català, Jordi Bechini, Montserrat Tenesa, Ricardo Pérez, Mariano Moya, Cristina Vilaplana, Joaquim Valls, Sergio Alonso, Daniel López, Pere-Joan Cardona, Clara Prats</p>

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that still causes more than 1.5 million deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that around 30% of the world’s population is latently infected. However, the mechanisms responsible for 10% of this reserve (i.e., of the latently infected population) developing an active disease are not fully understood, yet. The dynamic hypothesis suggests that endogenous reinfection has an important role in maintaining latent infection. In order to examine this hypothesis for falsifiability, an agent-based model of growth, merging, and proliferation of TB lesions was implemented in a computational bronchial tree, built with an iterative algorithm for the generation of bronchial bifurcations and tubes applied inside a virtual 3D pulmonary surface. The computational model was fed and parameterized with computed tomography (CT) experimental data from 5 latently infected minipigs. First, we used CT images to reconstruct the virtual pulmonary surfaces where bronchial trees are built. Then, CT data about TB lesion’ size and location to each minipig were used in the parameterization process. The model’s outcome provides spatial and size distributions of TB lesions that successfully reproduced experimental data, thus reinforcing the role of the bronchial tree as the spatial structure triggering endogenous reinfection. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the final number of lesions is strongly related with the endogenous reinfection frequency and maximum growth rate of the lesions, while their mean diameter mainly depends on the spatial spreading of new lesions and the maximum radius. Finally, the model was used as an <i>in silico</i> experimental platform to explore the transition from latent infection to active disease, identifying two main triggering factors: a high inflammatory response and the combination of a moderate inflammatory response with a small breathing amplitude.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/48zZq2xcYt8" width="1" />

<p>by Lei Wang, Zhu-Hong You, Yang-Ming Li, Kai Zheng, Yu-An Huang</p>

Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved 91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods, GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, we conducted case study experiments on diseases including breast cancer, glioma and colorectal cancer. The results showed that 16, 15 and 17 of the top 20 candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were respectively confirmed by relevant literature and databases. These results suggest that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sxyqcAr41hA" width="1" />

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), the causative infectious agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals per year than any other infectious agent. Granulomas, the hallmark of Mtb infection, are complex structures that form in lungs, composed of immune cells surrounding bacteria, infected cells, and a caseous necrotic core. While granulomas serve to physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria growth, some granulomas are unable to control Mtb growth, leading to bacteria and infected cells leaving the granuloma and disseminating, either resulting in additional granuloma formation (local or non-local) or spread to airways or lymph nodes. Dissemination is associated with development of active TB. It is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving dissemination from TB lung granulomas. Herein, we develop a novel hybrid multi-scale computational model, <i>MultiGran</i>, that tracks Mtb infection within multiple granulomas in an entire lung. <i>MultiGran</i> follows cells, cytokines, and bacterial populations within each lung granuloma throughout the course of infection and is calibrated to multiple non-human primate (NHP) cellular, granuloma, and whole-lung datasets. We show that <i>MultiGran</i> can recapitulate patterns of <i>in vivo</i> local and non-local dissemination, predict likelihood of dissemination, and predict a crucial role for multifunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage dynamics for preventing dissemination.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s01vVoOJjxc" width="1" />

<p>by Tobias S. Brett, Pejman Rohani</p>

Developing methods for anticipating the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases is both important and timely; however, traditional model-based approaches are stymied by uncertainty surrounding the underlying drivers. Here, we demonstrate an operational, mechanism-agnostic detection algorithm for disease (re-)emergence based on early warning signals (EWSs) derived from the theory of critical slowing down. Specifically, we used computer simulations to train a supervised learning algorithm to detect the dynamical footprints of (re-)emergence present in epidemiological data. Our algorithm was then challenged to forecast the slowly manifesting, spatially replicated reemergence of mumps in England in the mid-2000s and pertussis post-1980 in the United States. Our method successfully anticipated mumps reemergence 4 years in advance, during which time mitigation efforts could have been implemented. From 1980 onwards, our model identified resurgent states with increasing accuracy, leading to reliable classification starting in 1992. Additionally, we successfully applied the detection algorithm to 2 vector-transmitted case studies, namely, outbreaks of dengue serotypes in Puerto Rico and a rapidly unfolding outbreak of plague in 2017 in Madagascar. Taken together, these findings illustrate the power of theoretically informed machine learning techniques to develop early warning systems for the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMgEqDRtzdE" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The lateral habenula (LHb) sends complex projections to several areas of the mesopontine tegmentum, the raphe, and the hypothalamus. However, few markers have been available to distinguish subsets of LHb neurons that may serve these pathways. In order to address this complexity, we examined the mouse and rat LHb for neurons that express the GABA biosynthesis enzymes glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) and GAD2, and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). The mouse LHb contains a population of neurons that express GAD2, while the rat LHb contains discrete populations of neurons that express GAD1 and VGAT. However, we could not detect single neurons in either species that co-express a GABA synthetic enzyme and VGAT, suggesting that these LHb neurons do not use GABA for conventional synaptic transmission. Instead, all of the neuronal types expressing a GABAergic marker in both species showed co-expression of the glutamate transporter VGluT2. Anterograde tract-tracing of the projections of GAD2-expressing LHb neurons in <i>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice, combined with retrograde tracing from selected downstream nuclei, show that LHb-GAD2 neurons project selectively to the midline structures in the mesopontine tegmentum, including the median raphe (MnR) and nucleus incertus (NI), and only sparsely innervate the hypothalamus, rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Postsynaptic recording of LHb-GAD2 neuronal input to tegmental neurons confirms that glutamate, not GABA, is the fast neurotransmitter in this circuit. Thus, GAD2 expression can serve as a marker for functional studies of excitatory neurons serving specific LHb output pathways in mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Confidence judgments are a central tool in metacognition research. In a typical task, participants first perform perceptual (first-order) decisions and then rate their confidence in these decisions. The relationship between confidence and first-order accuracy is taken as a measure of metacognitive performance. Confidence is often assumed to stem from decision-monitoring processes alone, but processes that co-occur with the first-order decision may also play a role in confidence formation. In fact, some recent studies have revealed that directly manipulating motor regions in the brain, or the time of first-order decisions relative to second-order decisions, affects confidence judgments. This finding suggests that confidence could be informed by a readout of reaction times in addition to decision-monitoring processes. To test this possibility, we assessed the contribution of response-related signals to confidence and, in particular, to metacognitive performance (i.e., a measure of the adequacy of these confidence judgments). In human volunteers, we measured the effect of making an overt (vs covert) decision, as well as the effect of pairing an action to the stimulus about which the first-order decision is made. Against our expectations, we found no differences in overall confidence or metacognitive performance when first-order responses were covert as opposed to overt. Further, actions paired to visual stimuli presented led to higher confidence ratings, but did not affect metacognitive performance. These results suggest that confidence ratings do not always incorporate motor information.</p>

Abstract
<p>Local brain signal variability [SD of the BOLD signal (SD<sub>BOLD</sub>]] correlates with age and cognitive performance, and recently differentiated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether changes to SD<sub>BOLD</sub> precede diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment. We compared ostensibly healthy older adult humans who scored below the recommended threshold on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and who showed reduced medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume in a previous study ("at-risk" group, <i>n</i> = 20), with healthy older adults who scored within the normal range on the MoCA ("control" group, <i>n</i> = 20). Using multivariate partial least-squares analysis we assessed the correlations between SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and age, MoCA score, global fractional anisotropy, global mean diffusivity, and four cognitive factors. Greater SD<sub>BOLD</sub> in the MTL and occipital cortex positively correlated with performance on cognitive control/speed tasks but negatively correlated with memory scores in the control group. These relations were weaker in the at-risk group. A <i>post hoc</i> analysis assessed associations between MTL volumes and SD<sub>BOLD</sub> in both groups. This revealed a negative correlation, most robust in the at-risk group, between MTL SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and MTL subregion volumetry, particularly the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions. Together, these results suggest that the association between SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and cognition differs between the at-risk and control groups, which may be because of lower MTL volumes in the at-risk group. Our data indicate relations between MTL SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and cognition may be helpful in understanding brain differences in individuals who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.</p>

Abstract
<p>Social aggression, such as domestic violence, has been associated with a reduced ability to take on others’ perspectives. In this naturalistic imaging study, we investigated whether training human participants to take on a first-person embodied perspective during the experience of domestic violence enhances the identification with the victim and elicits brain activity associated with the monitoring of the body and surrounding space and the experience of threat. We combined fMRI measurements with preceding virtual reality exposure from either first-person perspective (1PP) or third-person perspective (3PP) to manipulate whether the domestic abuse stimulus was perceived as directed to oneself or another. We found that 1PP exposure increased body ownership and identification with the virtual victim. Furthermore, when the stimulus was perceived as directed toward oneself, the brain network that encodes the bodily self and its surrounding space was more strongly synchronized across participants and connectivity increased from premotor cortex (PM) and intraparietal sulcus towards superior parietal lobe. Additionally, when the stimulus came near the body, brain activity in the amygdala (AMG) strongly synchronized across participants. Exposure to 3PP reduced synchronization of brain activity in the personal space network, increased modulation of visual areas and strengthened functional connectivity between PM, supramarginal gyrus and primary visual cortex. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1PP embodiment training enhances experience from the viewpoint of the virtual victim, which is accompanied by synchronization in the fronto-parietal network to predict actions toward the body and in the AMG to signal the proximity of the stimulus.</p>

Abstract
<p>Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in the control of motor and higher cognitive functions such as learning, working memory, and decision making. The primary motor cortex (M1), which is essential for motor control and the acquisition of motor skills, receives dopaminergic inputs in its superficial and deep layers from the midbrain. However, the precise action of DA and DA receptor subtypes on the cortical microcircuits of M1 remains poorly understood. The aim of this work was to investigate in mice how DA, through the activation of D2-like receptors (D2Rs), modulates the cellular and synaptic activity of M1 parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs) which are crucial to regulate the spike output of pyramidal neurons (PNs). By combining immunofluorescence, <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology, pharmacology and optogenetics approaches, we show that D2R activation increases neuronal excitability of PVINs and GABAergic synaptic transmission between PVINs and PNs in Layer V of M1. Our data reveal how cortical DA modulates M1 microcircuitry, which could be important in the acquisition of motor skills.</p>

Abstract
<p>Mouse hippocampus retains the capacity for neurogenesis throughout lifetime, but such plasticity decreases with age. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) involves the birth, maturation, and synaptic integration of newborn granule cells (GCs) into preexisting hippocampal circuitry. While functional integration onto adult-born GCs has been extensively studied, maturation of efferent projections onto CA3 pyramidal cells is less understood, particularly in aged brain. Here, using combined light and reconstructive electron microscopy (EM), we describe the maturation of mossy fiber bouton (MFB) connectivity with CA3 pyramidal cells in young adult and aged mouse brain. We found mature synaptic contacts of newborn GCs were formed in both young and aged brains. However, the dynamics of their spatiotemporal development and the cellular process by which these cells functionally integrated over time were different. In young brain newborn GCs either formed independent nascent MFB synaptic contacts or replaced preexisting MFBs, but these contacts were pruned over time to a mature state. In aged brain only replacement of preexisting MFBs was observed and new contacts were without evidence of pruning. These data illustrate that functional synaptic integration of AHN occurs in young adult and aged brain, but with distinct dynamics. They suggest elimination of preexisting connectivity is required for the integration of adult-born GCs in aged brain.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The function(s) of the Biogenesis of Lysosome‐related Organelles Complex‐1 (BLOC‐1) during brain development is to date largely unknown. Here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse. Most of the defects observed early postnatally in the mutant mice were more prominent in males than in females and in the hippocampus. Male mutant mice, but not females, had smaller brains as compared to sex‐matching wild types at postnatal day 1 (P1), this deficit was largely recovered by P14 and P45. An abnormal cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was observed in P1 pallid male, but not female, or juvenile mice (P45), along with severely decreased expression levels of the radial glial marker Glutamate‐Aspartate Transporter. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the overall response to the lack of functional BLOC‐1 was more pronounced in hippocampi at P1 than at P45 or in the cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that absence of BLOC‐1 renders males more susceptible to perinatal brain maldevelopment and although most abnormalities appear to have been resolved in juvenile animals, still permanent defects may be present, resulting in faulty neuronal circuits, and contribute to previously reported cognitive and behavioral phenotypes in adult BLOC‐1‐deficient mice.</p>

<p>In utero electroporation (IUE) is a powerful tool for testing the role of genes in neuronal migration and function, but this technique suffers from high degrees of variability. Such variability can result from inconsistent surgery, developmental gradients along both rostral-caudal and medial-lateral axes, differences within littermates and from one litter to another. Comparisons between control and experimental electroporations rely on section matching, which is inherently subjective. These sources of variability are cumulative, leading to difficult to interpret data and an increased risk of both false positives and false negatives. To address these limitations, we developed two tools: (1) a new plasmid, termed Double UP, which combines LoxP-flanked reporters and limiting Cre dosages to generate internal controls, and (2) an automated program for unbiased and precise quantification of migration. In concert, these tools allow for more rigorous and objective experiments, while decreasing the mice, time, and reagents required to complete studies.</p>

<p>Objective: Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are major causes of intractable epilepsies. To characterize the early neuroimaging findings of MCDs, we tried to identify the MRI features consistent with pathological findings in an infant rat MCD model, prenatally exposed to methylazoxymethanol (MAM), by using newly developed MRI techniques.</p><p>Methods: At gestational day 15, two doses of MAM (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or normal saline were injected into pregnant rats. The offspring underwent in vivo MRI, including glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST), <sup>1</sup>H-MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging, at postnatal day (P) 15 using a 7T small-animal imaging system. Another set of prenatally MAM-exposed rats were sacrificed for histological staining.</p><p>Results: At P15, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of rats with MCDs showed decreased neuronal nuclei, parvalbumin, and reelin expressions. Moreover, dendritic arborization of pyramidal cells in the RSC significantly decreased in infant rats with MCDs. In vivo MRI showed significantly decreased GluCEST (%) in the RSC of rats with MCDs (p = 0.000) and a significant correlation between GluCEST (%) and RSC thickness (r = 0.685, p = 0.003). The rats with MCDs showed reduced glutamate (p = 0.002), N-acetylaspartate (p = 0.002), and macromolecule and lipid levels (p = 0.027) and significantly reduced fractional anisotropy values in the RSC.</p><p>Conclusion:In vivo MRI revealed reduced neuronal population and dendritic arborization in the RSC of infant rats with MCDs during the early postnatal period. These pathological changes of the cortex could serve as clinical imaging biomarkers of MCDs in infants.</p>

<p>In previous reports, we developed a method to apply Brownian optogenetic noise-photostimulation (BONP, 470 nm) up to 0.67 mW on the barrel cortex of in vivo ChR2 transgenic mice. In such studies, we found that the BONP produces an increase in the evoked field potentials and the neuronal responses of pyramidal neurons induced by somatosensory mechanical stimulation. Here we extended such findings by examining whether the same type of BONP augments the Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitude elicited by voltage-clamp ramps of dissociated pyramidal neurons from the somatosensory cortex of ChR2 transgenic and wild type mice. We found that in all neurons from the ChR2 transgenic mice, but none of the wild type mice, the peak amplitude of a TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> current and its inverse of latency exhibited inverted U-like graphs as a function of the BONP level. It means that an intermediate level of BONP increases both the peak amplitude of the Na<sup>+</sup> current and its inverse of latency. Our research suggests that the impact of BONP on the Na<sup>+</sup> channels of pyramidal neurons could be associated with the observed augmentation-effects in our previous in vivo preparation. Moreover, it provides caution information for the use of an appropriate range of light intensity, &lt;0.67 mW, which could avoid opto non-genetics (also termed “optonongenetic”) related responses due to light-induced temperature changes.</p>

Background<p>The reactivity enhancement of pain sensitive neurons in the nervous system is a feature of the pathogenesis for neuropathic pain (NP), yet the underlying mechanisms need to be fully understood. In this study, we made an attempt to clarify the NP-related hub genes and signaling pathways so as to provide effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods toward NP.</p>Methods<p>Microarray expression profile GSE30691 including the mRNA-seq data of the spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced NP rats was accessed from the GEO database. Then, genes associated with NP development were screened using differential analysis along with random walk with restart (RWR). GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to explore the biological functions and signaling pathways where the genes were activated. Afterward, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and GO analysis were conducted to further identify the hub genes which showed an intimate correlation with NP development.</p>Results<p>Totally 94 genes associated with NP development were screened by differential analysis and RWR analysis, and they were observed to be predominantly enriched in hormone secretion and transport, cAMP signaling pathway and other NP occurrence associated functions and pathways. Thereafter, the 94 genes were subjected to PPI analysis to find the genes much more associated with NP and a functional module composed of 48 genes were obtained. 8 hub genes including C3, C1qb, Ccl2, Cxcl13, Timp1, Fcgr2b, Gal, and Lyz2 were eventually identified after further association and functional enrichment analyses, and the expression of these 8 genes were all higher in SNI rats by comparison with those in Sham rats.</p>Conclusion<p>Based on the data collected from GEO database, this study discovered 8 hub genes that were closely related to NP occurrence and development, which help to provide potent theoretical basis for NP treatment.</p>

<p>The Parkinson’s disease-associated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a complex multi-domain protein belonging to the Roco protein family, a unique group of G-proteins. Variants of this gene are associated with an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. Besides its well-characterized enzymatic activities, conferred by its GTPase and kinase domains, and a central dimerization domain, it contains four predicted repeat domains, which are, based on their structure, commonly involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In the past decades, tremendous progress has been made in determining comprehensive interactome maps for the human proteome. Knowledge of PPIs has been instrumental in assigning functions to proteins involved in human disease and helped to understand the connectivity between different disease pathways and also significantly contributed to the functional understanding of LRRK2. In addition to an increased kinase activity observed for proteins containing PD-associated variants, various studies helped to establish LRRK2 as a large scaffold protein in the interface between cytoskeletal dynamics and the vesicular transport. This review first discusses a number of specific LRRK2-associated PPIs for which a functional consequence can at least be speculated upon, and then considers the representation of LRRK2 protein interactions in public repositories, providing an outlook on open research questions and challenges in this field.</p>

<p>The increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease represents a significant burden for patients and national health systems. The conditions are primarily caused by the death of neurons and other neural cell types. One important aim of current stem cell research is to find a way to replace the lost cells. In this perspective, neural stem cells (NSCs) have been considered as a promising tool in the field of regenerative medicine. The behavior of NSCs is modulated by environmental influences, for example hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules or biomechanics. These factors can be studied by using well-defined hydrogels, which are polymeric networks of synthetic or natural origin with the ability to swell in water. These gels can be modified with a variety of molecules and optimized with regard to their mechanical properties to mimic the natural extracellular environment. In particular modifications applying distinct units such as functional domains and peptides can modulate the development of NSCs with regard to proliferation, differentiation and migration. One well-known peptide sequence that affects the behavior of NSCs is the integrin recognition sequence RGD that has originally been derived from fibronectin. In the present review we provide an overview concerning the applications of modified hydrogels with an emphasis on synthetic hydrogels based on poly(acrylamides), as modified with either cationic moieties or the peptide sequence RGD. This knowledge might be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for the therapy of spinal cord injuries, neurodegenerative diseases and traumata.</p>

<p>Central coordination of cardiovascular function is accomplished, in part, by the baroreceptor reflex, a multi-input multi-output physiological control system that regulates the activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems via interactions among multiple brainstem nuclei. Recent single-cell analyses within the brain revealed that individual neurons within and across brain nuclei exhibit distinct transcriptional states contributing to neuronal function. Such transcriptional heterogeneity complicates the task of understanding how neurons within and across brain nuclei organize and function to process multiple inputs and coordinate cardiovascular functions within the larger context of the baroreceptor reflex. However, prior analysis of brainstem neurons revealed that single-neuron transcriptional heterogeneity reflects an adaptive response to synaptic inputs and that neurons organize into distinct subtypes with respect to synaptic inputs received. Based on these results, we hypothesize that adaptation of neuronal subtypes support robust biological function through graded cellular responses. We test this hypothesis by examining the functional impact of neuronal adaptation on parasympathetic activity within the context of short-term baroreceptor reflex regulation. In this work, we extend existing quantitative closed-loop models of the baroreceptor reflex by incorporating into the model distinct input-driven neuronal subtypes and neuroanatomical groups that modulate parasympathetic activity. We then use this extended model to investigate, via simulation, the functional role of neuronal adaptation under conditions of health and systolic heart failure. Simulation results suggest that parasympathetic activity can be modulated appropriately by the coordination of distinct neuronal subtypes to maintain normal cardiovascular functions under systolic heart failure conditions. Moreover, differing degrees of adaptation of these neuronal subtypes contribute to cardiovascular behaviors corresponding to distinct clinical phenotypes of heart failure, such as exercise intolerance. Further, our results suggest that an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity regulating ventricular contractility contributes to exercise intolerance in systolic heart failure patients, and restoring this balance can improve the short-term cardiovascular performance of these patients.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence has indicated that activation of microglia and neuroinflammation reaction play a prominent role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Inhibition of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been shown to be associated with immune responses and brain damage, but its effects on AD remain unclear. This study mainly aimed to investigate the protective effect of TAK-242 (TLR4-specific inhibitor) on microglial polarization and neuroprotection in an AD mouse model and the underlying mechanisms. We found that APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice exhibited a dramatic increase in TLR4 levels concomitant with a significantly higher expression of inflammatory microglia compared to C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 by TAK-242 administration significantly improved neurological function, decreased the level of Bax, and caused a significant reduction in the levels of M1-markers (iNOS and TNFα), while the expressions of M2-phenotype markers (Trem-2 and Arg-1) were increased both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, TAK-242 treatment enhanced BV2 microglial phagocytosis. Moreover, Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>35</sub> caused the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine production, MyD88, NF-kappaB-p65, and NLRP3, which could be ameliorated by NLRP3-siRNA or TAK-242. These findings indicated that TLR4 inhibition provided neuroprotection and promoted a microglial switch from the inflammatory M1 phenotype to the protective M2 phenotype in AD. The mechanism involved may be related to modulation of the MyD88/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Single cell electrophysiology remains one of the most widely used approaches of systems neuroscience. Decisions made by the experimenter during electrophysiology recording largely determine recording quality, duration of the project and value of the collected data. Therefore, online feedback aiding these decisions can lower monetary and time investment, and substantially speed up projects as well as allow novel studies otherwise not possible due to prohibitively low throughput. Real-time feedback is especially important in studies that involve optogenetic cell type identification by enabling a systematic search for neurons of interest. However, such tools are scarce and limited to costly commercial systems with high degree of specialization, which hitherto prevented wide-ranging benefits for the community. To address this, we present an open-source tool that enables online feedback during electrophysiology experiments and provides a Python interface for the widely used Open Ephys open source data acquisition system. Specifically, our software allows flexible online visualization of spike alignment to external events, called the online peri-event time histogram (OPETH). These external events, conveyed by digital logic signals, may indicate photostimulation time stamps for in vivo optogenetic cell type identification or the times of behaviorally relevant events during in vivo behavioral neurophysiology experiments. Therefore, OPETH allows real-time identification of genetically defined neuron types or behaviorally responsive populations. By allowing “hunting” for neurons of interest, OPETH significantly reduces experiment time and thus increases the efficiency of experiments that combine in vivo electrophysiology with behavior or optogenetic tagging of neurons.</p>

Methylene blue at low doses stimulates cytochrome oxidase activity and may thus counteract the adverse effects of cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the effects of methylene blue on cytochrome oxidase activity during chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have not been described before. To test this hypothesis, rats underwent bilateral carotid artery occlusion or sham surgery, received daily 4 mg/kg methylene blue or saline injections, and learned a visual water task. Brain mapping of cytochrome oxidase activity was done by quantitative enzyme histochemistry. Permanent carotid occlusion for 1 month resulted in decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, and weaker interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity between these regions. Methylene blue preserved cytochrome oxidase activity in regions affected by carotid occlusion and strengthened their interregional correlations of cytochrome oxidase activity, which prevented neurodegenerative effects and facilitated task-specific learning and memory. Brain-behavior correlations revealed positive correlations between performance and brain regions in which cytochrome oxidase activity was preserved by methylene blue. These results are the first to demonstrate that methylene blue prevents neurodegeneration and memory impairment by preserving cytochrome oxidase activity and interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity in brain regions susceptible to chronic hypoperfusion. This demonstration provides further support for the hypothesis that lower cerebral blood flow results in an Alzheimer’s-like syndrome and that stimulating cytochrome oxidase activity with low-dose methylene blue is neuroprotective.</p>

<p>Traditionally, in vitro generation of donor cells for brain repair has been dominated by the application of extrinsic growth factors and morphogens. Recent advances in cell engineering strategies such as reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and direct cell fate conversion have impressively demonstrated the feasibility to manipulate cell identities by the overexpression of cell fate-determining transcription factors. These strategies are now increasingly implemented for transcription factor-guided differentiation of neural precursors and forward programming of pluripotent stem cells toward specific neural subtypes. This review covers major achievements, pros and cons, as well as future prospects of transcription factor-based cell fate specification and the applicability of these approaches for the generation of donor cells for brain repair.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56801">Slightly beneficial genes are retained by bacteria evolving DNA uptake despite selfish elements</a></h4>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene loss result in rapid changes in the gene content of bacteria. While HGT aids bacteria to adapt to new environments, it also carries risks such as selfish genetic elements (SGEs). Here, we use modelling to study how HGT of slightly beneficial genes impacts growth rates of bacterial populations, and if bacteria collectives can evolve to take up DNA despite selfish elements. We find four classes of slightly beneficial genes: indispensable, enrichable, rescuable, and unrescuable genes. Rescuable genes — genes with small fitness benefits that are lost from the population without HGT — can be collectively retained by a community that engages in costly HGT. While this `gene-sharing' cannot evolve in well-mixed cultures, it does evolve in a spatial population like a biofilm. Despite enabling infection by harmful SGEs, the uptake of DNA is evolutionarily maintained by the hosts, explaining the coexistence of bacteria and SGEs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56325"><i>Drosophila</i> SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms</a></h4>

Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A.Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities <i>via</i> an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. <i>Drosophila</i> generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55845">Identification of a novel toxicophore in anti-cancer chemotherapeutics that targets mitochondrial respiratory complex I</a></h4>

Disruption of mitochondrial function selectively targets tumour cells that are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. However, due to their high energy demands, cardiac cells are disproportionately targeted by mitochondrial toxins resulting in a loss of cardiac function. An analysis of the effects of mubritinib on cardiac cells showed that this drug did not inhibit HER2 as reported, but directly inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex I, reducing cardiac-cell beat rate, with prolonged exposure resulting in cell death. We used a library of chemical variants of mubritinib and showed that modifying the 1H-1,2,3-triazole altered complex I inhibition, identifying the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as the toxicophore. The same toxicophore is present in a second anti-cancer therapeutic carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) and we demonstrate that CAI also functions through complex I inhibition, mediated by the toxicophore. Complex I inhibition is directly linked to anti-cancer cell activity, with toxicophore modification ablating the desired effects of these compounds on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.

<p>by Chao Kong, Yu-Xiang Yao, Zhi-Tong Bing, Bing-Hui Guo, Liang Huang, Zi-Gang Huang, Ying-Cheng Lai</p>

Non-coding RNAs are fundamental to the competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) hypothesis in oncology. Previous work focused on static CeRNA networks. We construct and analyze CeRNA networks for four sequential stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on multi-omics data of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs and mRNAs. We find that the networks possess a two-level bipartite structure: common competing endogenous network (CCEN) composed of an invariant set of microRNAs over all the stages and stage-dependent, unique competing endogenous networks (UCENs). A systematic enrichment analysis of the pathways of the mRNAs in CCEN reveals that they are strongly associated with cancer development. We also find that the microRNA-linked mRNAs from UCENs have a higher enrichment efficiency. A key finding is six microRNAs from CCEN that impact patient survival at all stages, and four microRNAs that affect the survival from a specific stage. The ten microRNAs can then serve as potential biomarkers and prognostic tools for LUAD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1pKXGg7bnUY" width="1" />

<p>by Lisa C. Simonsen, Tony C. Slaba, Peter Guida, Adam Rusek</p>

With exciting new NASA plans for a sustainable return to the moon, astronauts will once again leave Earth’s protective magnetosphere only to endure higher levels of radiation from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and the possibility of a large solar particle event (SPE). Gateway, lunar landers, and surface habitats will be designed to protect crew against SPEs with vehicle optimization, storm shelter concepts, and/or active dosimetry; however, the ever penetrating GCR will continue to pose the most significant health risks especially as lunar missions increase in duration and as NASA sets its aspirations on Mars. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as potential immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. Characterization and mitigation of these risks requires a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) heavy-ion exposures and the validation of countermeasures in a relevant space environment. Historically, most research on understanding space radiation-induced health risks has been performed using acute exposures of monoenergetic single-ion beams. However, the space radiation environment consists of a wide variety of ion species over a broad energy range. Using the fast beam switching and controls systems technology recently developed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a new era in radiobiological research is possible. NASA has developed the “GCR Simulator” to generate a spectrum of ion beams that approximates the primary and secondary GCR field experienced at human organ locations within a deep-space vehicle. The majority of the dose is delivered from protons (approximately 65%–75%) and helium ions (approximately 10%–20%) with heavier ions (Z ≥ 3) contributing the remainder. The GCR simulator exposes state-of-the art cellular and animal model systems to 33 sequential beams including 4 proton energies plus degrader, 4 helium energies plus degrader, and the 5 heavy ions of C, O, Si, Ti, and Fe. A polyethylene degrader system is used with the 100 MeV/n H and He beams to provide a nearly continuous distribution of low-energy particles. A 500 mGy exposure, delivering doses from each of the 33 beams, requires approximately 75 minutes. To more closely simulate the low-dose rates found in space, sequential field exposures can be divided into daily fractions over 2 to 6 weeks, with individual beam fractions as low as 0.1 to 0.2 mGy. In the large beam configuration (60 × 60 cm<sup>2</sup>), 54 special housing cages can accommodate 2 to 3 mice each for an approximately 75 min duration or 15 individually housed rats. On June 15, 2018, the NSRL made a significant achievement by completing the first operational run using the new GCR simulator. This paper discusses NASA’s innovative technology solution for a ground-based GCR simulator at the NSRL to accelerate our understanding and mitigation of health risks faced by astronauts. Ultimately, the GCR simulator will require validation across multiple radiogenic risks, endpoints, doses, and dose rates.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QTWrG0NjKNI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex hormone transition may trigger severe depressive episodes in some women. In order to map mechanisms related to such phenomena we developed a pharmacological preclinical human model using sex hormone manipulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in a placebo‐controlled design. Here the findings from this model is synthesized and discussed in the context of related literature on hormonal contributions to reproductive mental health disorders. The GnRha model work points to an estradiol‐dependent depressive response in healthy women undergoing short‐term sex hormone manipulation with GnRHa, which is linked to serotonin transporter changes (a key regulator of synaptic serotonin), a disengagement of hippocampus, and overengagement of brain networks recruited when processing emotional salient information. Further, the GnRHa model suggest that key brain regions in the reward circuit are less engaged in positive stimuli when undergoing sex hormone manipulation, which may underlie anhedonia. Also, the work supports that enhanced sensitivity to estrogen signaling at the level of gene expression may drive increased risk for depressive symptoms when exposed to sex steroid hormone fluctuations. In conclusion, the GnRHa model work highlights the brain signatures of rapid and profound changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, which reflect plausible mechanisms by which risk for mood disorders works. This model points to the role of estrogen dynamics and sensitivity, and offers a rationale for personalized prevention in hormonal transition phases, for example pregnancy to postpartum transition, perimenopause, and hormone treatments, which now can move into clinical translation and ideally pave the way for protecting mental and cognitive health.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.</p>

<p>In the inner retina (from GCL to IPL), ganglion cells express high levels of CD200, CD47, and CX3CL1, followed by amacrine cells. Vascular endothelial cells express CD200 and CD47. They also express complement factor H and CD59a. In the outer retina (from INL to ONL), horizontal cells, on the one hand, express high levels of CD200 and CD47, whereas bipolar cells express only low levels of TGFβ2 and CD47. Photoreceptors, on the other hand, express CD59a and CD47 and the expression is increased in disease conditions such as retinal detachment and uveoretinitis. Immune activation (including microglial and complement activation) in the inner retina may be regulated predominately by ganglion cells and vascular endothelial cells with the support from amacrine cells, whereas immune activation in the outer retina may be regulated by horizontal cell and photoreceptors. Müller cells, which span throughout the neuroretina, express TGFβ2 and CD47 and may participate in the regulation of all types of retinal immune activation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuroretina is protected by its own defense system, that is microglia and the complement system. Under normal physiological conditions, microglial activation is tightly regulated by the neurons although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using published single‐cell RNA sequencing data sets, we found that immune regulatory molecules including CD200, CD47, CX3CL1, TGFβ, and complement inhibitor CD59a are expressed by various retinal neurons. Importantly, we found that photoreceptors express higher levels of CD47 and CD59a, which was further confirmed in cultured 661W cells, WERI‐Rb1 cells, and microdissected photoreceptors from human eyes. The expression of CD59a mRNA in 661W cells was upregulated by TNFα and hypoxia, whereas LPS, hypoxia, and IL‐4 upregulated CD47 mRNA expression in 661W cells. Immunofluorescence staining detected strong CD59a immunoreactivity in the outer nuclear layer, inner/outer segments, and discrete staining in ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer. The expression of CD59a in photoreceptors was increased in the detached retina, but decreased in retinas from experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) mice. In EAU retina, CD59a was highly expressed by active immune cells. CD47 was detected in GCL, IPL, and inner nuclear layer and some photoreceptors. The expression of CD47 in photoreceptors was also increased in the detached retina but decreased in EAU retina. In a coculture system, 661W enhanced arginase‐1 and reduced IL‐6 mRNA expression in BV2 microglial cells. Our results suggest that photoreceptors express immune regulatory molecules and may have the potential to regulate immune activation in the outer retina/subretinal space under pathophysiological conditions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U‐shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor‐ and non‐motor‐related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole‐brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained <i>via </i> the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function <i>via </i> microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Maternal deprivation, a model of child neglect, increases VTA dopamine (DA) neuronal excitability through impaired interaction between AKAP150 and PKA resulting in GABAergic dysfunction. This neuroadaptation may be affected through HDAC2 and is reversible by in vivo HDAC inhibition suggesting the potential therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitors in reversal of VTA DA dysfunction.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic early life stress (ELS) is linked to dopamine (DA) dysregulation which increases the probability of developing psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood. Our prior studies demonstrated that a severe early life stressor, a 24‐hr maternal deprivation (MD) in juvenile male rats, could lead to altered DA signaling from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) due to impairment of GABAergic synaptic plasticity (promoting GABAergic long‐term depression, LTD) with concomitant changes in the abundance of synaptic regulators including A‐kinase anchoring protein (AKAP150). Importantly, these MD‐induced synaptic changes in the VTA were accompanied by upregulation of histone deacetylase 2, histone hypoacetylation, and were reversible by HDAC inhibition. Using cell‐attached and whole‐cell patch clamp recordings, we found that MD stress also increased spontaneous VTA DA neuronal activity and excitability in juvenile male rats without affecting intrinsic excitability. Postsynaptic chemical disruption of AKAP150 and protein kinase A interaction increased VTA DA neuronal excitability in control non‐MD rats mimicking the effects of MD on DA cell excitability with similar changes in membrane properties. Interestingly, this disruption decreased MD‐induced VTA DA hyperexcitability. This MD‐induced DA neuronal hyperexcitability could also be normalized at 24 hr after injection of the class 1 HDAC inhibitor, CI‐994. Altogether, our data suggest that AKAP150 plays a critical role in the regulation of VTA DA neuronal excitability and that HDAC‐mediated targeting of AKAP150 signaling could normalize VTA DA dysfunction following ELS thereby providing novel therapeutic targets for prevention of later life psychopathology.</p>

<p>Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP, astrocyte endfeet) produce growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is released and modulates the astrocyte morphological changes and tight junction strengthening. Astrocytes and tight junctions are disrupted in diseased conditions and can be restored by pharmacologically driven increased GDF15 production at PAP.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP) surround cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) and modulate the strengthening of tight junctions to influence blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Morphologically altered astrocytes may affect barrier properties and trigger the onset of brain pathologies. However, astrocyte‐dependent mediators of these events remain poorly studied. Here, we show a pharmacologically driven elevated expression and release of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in rat primary astrocytes and cerebral PAP. GDF15 has been shown to possess trophic properties for motor neurons, prompting us to hypothesize similar effects on astrocytes. Indeed, its increased expression and release occurred simultaneously to morphological changes of astrocytes <i>in vitro </i> and PAP, suggesting modulatory effects of GDF15 on these cells, but also neighboring EC. Administration of recombinant GDF15 was sufficient to promote astrocyte remodeling and enhance barrier properties between ECs <i>in vitro </i>, whereas its pharmacogenetic abrogation prevented these effects. We validated our findings in male high anxiety‐related behavior rats, an animal model of depressive‐like behavior, with shrunk PAP associated with reduced expression of the junctional protein claudin‐5, which were both restored by a pharmacologically induced increase in GDF15 expression. Thus, we identified GDF15 as an astrocyte‐derived trigger of astrocyte process remodeling linked to enhanced tight junction strengthening at the BBB.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder not responding to at least two adequate treatments are defined as treatment‐refractory major depressive disorder (TR‐MDD). Some TR‐MDD patients have altered metabolic phenotypes that may be pharmacologically reversed. The characterization of these phenotypes and their underlying etiologies is paramount, particularly their genetic components. In this study, TR‐MDD patients (<i>n </i> = 124) were recruited and metabolites were quantified in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood. Three sub‐categories of deficiencies were examined, namely 5‐methyltetrahydrofolte (in CSF; <i>n </i> = 13), tetrahydrobiopterin (in CSF; <i>n </i> = 11), and abnormal acylcarnitine profiles (in peripheral blood; <i>n </i> = 8). Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from the entire TR‐MDD cohort and exonic variant allele frequencies for cases were compared to a control cohort (1:5 matching on ancestry). Low frequency, damaging alleles were identified and used for <i>in silico </i> pathway analyses. Three association signals for TR‐MDD approached genome‐wide significance on chromosomes 22, 7, and 3. Three risk‐associated variants from a prior depression study were replicated. Relevant biological pathways were identified that contained an enrichment of rare, damaging variants in central nervous system (CNS)‐specific pathways, including neurotransmitter receptors, potassium channels, and synapse transmission. Some TR‐MDD patients had rare variants in genes that were previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, psychiatric endophenotypes, CNS structural defects, and CNS‐related cellular and molecular functions. Exome analysis of metabolically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients has identified potentially functional gene pathways and low frequency, deleterious gene variants for further investigation. Further studies in larger cohorts of biochemically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients are desirable to extend and confirm these findings.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With high morbidity and mortality worldwide, injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) usually result in devastating consequences. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood and current therapies are still limited. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of endogenous noncoding RNAs, characterized by covalently closed annular structure. It is gradually recognized that circRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, such as acting as microRNA sponges or scaffolds during the assembly of protein complex and modulating the transcription of certain genes. Interestingly, circRNAs have been found to be highly expressed in the CNS, which indicates their neurospecificity. Several circRNAs have already been discovered to be associated with multiple pathophysiological processes following neurological diseases. Currently, the molecular roles of circRNAs in CNS injuries have gained increasing attention, leading to uninterrupted relevant researches. Herein, we presented a review of current studies on the role of circRNAs in CNS injuries. The therapeutic potency of circRNAs in CNS injuries was also analyzed.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perinatal hypoxic‐ischemic (HI)‐related brain injury is an important cause of morbidity and long‐standing disability in newborns. The only currently approved therapeutic strategy available to reduce brain injury in the newborn is hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia can only be used to treat HI encephalopathy in full‐term infants and survivors remain at high risk for a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities as a result of residual brain injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for adjunctive therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and neurovascular damage are important factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HI‐related brain injury and represent exciting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we address the role of each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in the pathophysiology of HI‐related injury in the neonatal brain. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) observed in the early hours after an HI‐related event is associated with a response at the basal lamina level, which comprises astrocytes, pericytes, and immune cells, all of which could affect BBB function to further exacerbate parenchymal injury. Future research is required to determine potential drugs that could prevent or attenuate neurovascular damage and/or augment repair. However, some studies have reported beneficial effects of hypothermia, erythropoietin, stem cell therapy, anti‐cytokine therapy and metformin in ameliorating several different facets of damage to the NVU after HI‐related brain injury in the perinatal period.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides protection, rigidity, and structure toward cells. It consists, among others, of a wide variety of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which act together to produce a complex and dynamic environment, most relevant in transmembrane events. In the brain, the ECM occupies a notable proportion of its volume and maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS). In addition, remodeling of the ECM, that is transient changes in ECM proteins regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is an important process that modulates cell behavior upon injury, thereby facilitating recovery. Failure of ECM remodeling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative demyelinating disease of the CNS with an inflammatory response against protective myelin sheaths that surround axons. Remyelination of denuded axons improves the neuropathological conditions of MS, but this regeneration process fails over time, leading to chronic disease progression. In this review, we uncover abnormal ECM remodeling in MS lesions by discussing ECM remodeling in experimental demyelination models, that is when remyelination is successful, and compare alterations in ECM components to the ECM composition and MMP expression in the parenchyma of demyelinated MS lesions, that is when remyelination fails. Inter‐ and intralesional differences in ECM remodeling in the distinct white matter MS lesions are discussed in terms of consequences for oligodendrocyte behavior and remyelination (failure). Hence, the review will aid to understand how abnormal ECM remodeling contributes to remyelination failure in MS lesions and assists in developing therapeutic strategies to promote remyelination.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This review article highlights the current state of perinatal depression (PND) research including established standards of care and innovative research in progress. PND can have a significant adverse impact on mother, child, and family; however, to date, wide‐scale identification, prevention, and treatment have been limited. PND is heterogenous in presentation with likely multifactorial etiologies for each woman. Challenges in PND research are discussed including a need for universal tools, standardized measures, benchmarks, and best practices. Current examples are reviewed that highlight approaches to novel treatment paradigms and interventions. This includes reviewing epidemiologic studies in PND research, examining the biological underpinnings of PND, and discussing examples from this field and other fields currently developing translational research that spans from bench to bedside. Current and future challenges and opportunities in developing best practices for the treatment of PND are outlined. We also discuss the use of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach for PND research and provide recommendations for future directions in PND research collaboration. In conclusion, greater precision in perinatal psychiatry can be possible in the future with the development of guidelines and best practices that build on current work and apply innovative and collaborative approaches of scientists, providers, patients, community members, and government officials.</p>

<p>Depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Based on symptoms above clinical cut‐offs for depression, five distinct groups could be distinguished with different levels of depressive symptoms from during pregnancy through six months after childbirth. The associations were then tested between a number of background‐ and lifestyle‐, pregnancy‐, delivery‐, and postpartum‐related characteristics and these trajectory groups.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence of over 10%, is associated with long‐term health risks for both mothers and offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn from a large population‐based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (<i>n </i> = 2,466). Five trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ≥13 (pregnancy) or ≥12 points (postpartum): (a) <i>healthy </i> (60.6%), (b) <i>pregnancy depression </i> (8.5%), (c) <i>early postpartum onset </i> (10.9%), (d) <i>late postpartum onset </i> (5.4%), and (e) <i>chronic depression </i> (14.6%). In multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference. Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were primarily associated with <i>pregnancy depression </i> and <i>chronic depression </i>. Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence, interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery experience was associated with <i>early postpartum onset </i>. Postpartum factors (e.g., infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties) were associated with <i>early  </i>and <i>late postpartum onset </i> together with <i>chronic depression </i>. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories, studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR‐per 1 <i>SD </i> increase = 1.20), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (OR = 1.17) Interleukin (IL)‐18 (OR = 1.06), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF‐23) (OR = 1.25), and C‐X‐C motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transition to motherhood encompasses physiological and behavioral adaptations essential for the initiation and maintenance of offspring care and feeding and includes widespread changes throughout the brain. The growth of new neurons occurs across the lifespan in distinct regions of mammalian brains and changes dynamically across reproductive events in female mammals. The subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus undergo high rates of neurogenesis in adulthood and are sensitive to hormonal fluctuations. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased cell proliferation in the SVZ and interneuron survival in the olfactory bulb. In mice, peripartum prolactin signaling mediates SVZ neurogenesis and is important for enhanced olfactory recognition of offspring and maternal care. In contrast, cell proliferation and immature neuron survival decrease in the DG during the postpartum period. High baseline glucocorticoid concentrations suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially representing an energetic trade‐off accompanying a reduced need for spatial navigation early postpartum. In women, hippocampal volume decline during pregnancy and partial recovery during the postpartum period could contribute to the risk of psychiatric illness. New evidence indicates that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) is an additional site for adult neurogenesis sensitive to reproductive experience and offspring contact. In this review, we discuss the initial and lasting impact of maternal experience on adult neurogenesis. Because neurogenesis has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses, understanding how reproductive experience alters new neuron production in maternal mammals has far‐reaching implications for women's health and wellness across the lifespan.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.</p>

<p>Intersectional viral genetics allows for targeted expression in astrocytes. Olfactory bulb astrocyte calcium activity spatially matches neuronal activity patterns with odor stimulation. Manipulating astrocyte calcium activity alters neuronal activity and impacts olfactory behavior.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the central nervous system. They modulate synaptic function through a variety of mechanisms, and yet remain relatively understudied with respect to overall neuronal circuit function. Exploiting the tractability of the mouse olfactory system, we manipulated astrocyte activity and examined how astrocytes modulate olfactory bulb responses. Toward this, we genetically targeted both astrocytes and neurons for <i>in vivo </i> widefield imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to odor stimuli. We found that astrocytes exhibited odor response maps that overlap with excitatory neuronal activity. By manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes using chemical genetics we found that odor‐evoked neuronal activity was reciprocally affected, suggesting that astrocyte activation inhibits neuronal odor responses. Subsequently, behavioral experiments revealed that astrocyte manipulations affect both odor detection threshold and discrimination, suggesting that astrocytes play an active role in olfactory sensory processing circuits. Together, these studies show that astrocyte calcium signaling contributes to olfactory behavior through modulation of sensory circuits.</p>

<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a complex sensorimotor disorder in which the role of the endogenous opioid system is not clear. This study suggests that the anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems could underlie the pathogenesis of RLS.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an irresistible need to move the legs while sitting or lying at night with insomnia as a frequent consequence. Human RLS has been associated with abnormalities in the endogenous opioid system, the dopaminergic system, the iron regulatory system, anemia, and inflammatory and auto‐immune disorders. Our previous work indicates that mice lacking all three subtypes of opioid receptors have a phenotype similar to that of human RLS. To study the roles of each opioid receptor subtype in RLS, we first used mu opioid receptor knockout (MOR KO) mice based on our earlier studies using postmortem brain and cell culture. The KO mice showed decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells (RBCs), with an appearance of microcytic RBCs indicating anemia. Together with decreased serum iron and transferrin, but increased ferritin levels, the anemia is similar to that seen with chronic inflammation in humans. A decreased serum iron level was also observed in the wildtype mice treated with an MOR antagonist. Iron was increased in the liver and spleen of the KO mice. Normal circadian variations in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems were absent in the KO mice. The KO mice showed hyperactivity and increased thermal sensitivity in wakefulness primarily during what would normally be the sleep phase similar to that seen in human RLS. Deficits in endogenous opioid system transmission could predispose to anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems, thereby contributing to an RLS‐like phenotype.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00008">The (Un)Conscious Mouse as a Model for Human Brain Functions: Key Principles of Anesthesia and Their Impact on Translational Neuroimaging</a></h4>

<p>In recent years, technical and procedural advances have brought functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to the field of murine neuroscience. Due to its unique capacity to measure functional activity non-invasively, across the entire brain, fMRI allows for the direct comparison of large-scale murine and human brain functions. This opens an avenue for bidirectional translational strategies to address fundamental questions ranging from neurological disorders to the nature of consciousness. The key challenges of murine fMRI are: (1) to generate and maintain functional brain states that approximate those of calm and relaxed human volunteers, while (2) preserving neurovascular coupling and physiological baseline conditions. Low-dose anesthetic protocols are commonly applied in murine functional brain studies to prevent stress and facilitate a calm and relaxed condition among animals. Yet, current mono-anesthesia has been shown to impair neural transmission and hemodynamic integrity. By linking the current state of murine electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and fMRI of anesthetic effects to findings from human studies, this systematic review proposes general principles to design, apply and monitor anesthetic protocols in a more sophisticated way. The further development of balanced multimodal anesthesia, combining two or more drugs with complementary modes of action helps to shape and maintain specific brain states and relevant aspects of murine physiology. Functional connectivity and its dynamic repertoire as assessed by fMRI can be used to make inferences about cortical states and provide additional information about whole-brain functional dynamics. Based on this, a simple and comprehensive functional neurosignature pattern can be determined for use in defining brain states and anesthetic depth in rest and in response to stimuli. Such a signature can be evaluated and shared between labs to indicate the brain state of a mouse during experiments, an important step toward translating findings across species.</p>

<p>The brain is complex and heterogeneous. Even though numerous independent studies indicate cortical hyperexcitability as a potential contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, the mechanisms that are responsible for upper motor neuron (UMN) vulnerability remain elusive. To reveal the electrophysiological determinants of corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN, a.k.a UMN in mice) vulnerability, we investigated the motor cortex of hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at P30 (postnatal day 30), a presymptomatic time point. Glutamate uncaging by laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed altered dynamics especially within the inhibitory circuitry and more specifically in L2/3 of the motor cortex, whereas the excitatory microcircuits were unchanged. Observed microcircuitry changes were specific to CSMN in the motor column. Electrophysiological evaluation of the intrinsic properties in response to the microcircuit changes, as well as the exon microarray expression profiles of CSMN isolated from hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and healthy mice at P30, revealed the presence of a very dynamic set of events, ultimately directed to establish, maintain and retain the balance at this early stage. Also, the expression profile of key voltage-gated potassium and sodium channel subunits as well as of the inhibitory GABA receptor subunits and modulatory proteins began to suggest the challenges CSMN face at this early age. Since neurodegeneration is initiated when neurons can no longer maintain balance, the complex cellular events that occur at this critical time point help reveal how CSMN try to cope with the challenges of disease manifestation. This information is critically important for the proper modulation of UMNs and for developing effective treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds within the transmembrane regions of membrane protein substrates, releasing bioactive fragments that play roles in many physiological and pathological processes. Based on their catalytic mechanism and nucleophile, I-CLiPs are classified into metallo, serine, aspartyl, and glutamyl proteases. Presenilin is the most prominent among I-CLiPs, as the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase (GS) complex responsible for cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, as well as many other membrane substrates. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GS provide new details on how presenilin recognizes and cleaves APP and Notch. First, presenilin transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 6 are dynamic. Second, upon binding to GS, the substrate TM helix is unwound from the C-terminus, resulting in an intermolecular β-sheet between the substrate and presenilin. The transition of the substrate C-terminus from α-helix to β-sheet is proposed to expose the scissile peptide bond in an extended conformation, leaving it susceptible to protease cleavage. Despite the astounding new insights in recent years, many crucial questions remain unanswered regarding the inner workings of γ-secretase, however. Key unanswered questions include how the enzyme recognizes and recruits substrates, how substrates are translocated from an initial docking site to the active site, how active site aspartates recruit and coordinate catalytic water, and the nature of the mechanisms of processive trimming of the substrate and product release. Answering these questions will have important implications for drug discovery aimed at selectively reducing the amyloid load in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with minimal side effects.</p>

Objective<p>Melatonin is the major hormone produced and secreted at night by the pineal gland into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and circulation. The relationship between plasma melatonin levels and Parkinson’s disease is not clear. The aim of the current study was to assess plasma melatonin levels in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and to analysis the relationship between plasma melatonin levels and non-motor symptoms.</p>Participants and Methods<p>In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 61 patients with idiopathic PD [males n = 30 (49.2%), average age 62.4 years (range: 46–73 years)] and a total of 58 healthy volunteers [males n = 30 (51.7%), average age 64.3 years (range: 45–70 years)] who participated in the study. Plasma melatonin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The severity of disease in PD patients was scored by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Staging scale. The quality of life in PD patients was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire. The non-motor symptoms were assessed by the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for PD.</p>Results<p>Compared with the healthy controls, the plasma melatonin levels were significantly higher in PD patients (12.82 ± 4.85 vs. 19.40 ± 4.23, P &lt; 0.001). Plasma melatonin levels were significantly associated with the levodopa equivalent daily dose (r = −0.262, P &lt; 0.05, n = 61). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the negative cardiovascular symptom group than in the cardiovascular symptom group (20.13 ± 3.74 vs. 16.93 ± 3.74, P &lt; 0.05). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the non-sleep-disorders group than in the sleep disorders group (22.12 ± 5.93 vs. 18.86 ± 3.66, P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the plasma melatonin concentration was higher in the group without gastrointestinal dysfunction than in the gastrointestinal dysfunction group (21.71 ± 4.44 vs. 18.35 ± 3.74, P &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>This study revealed that the plasma melatonin levels in PD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Non-motor symptoms that were significantly negatively correlated with plasma melatonin levels were cardiovascular symptoms, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Plasma melatonin levels have the closest relationship with sleep disorders. There was a correlation between plasma melatonin levels and sleep quality in patients with PD. The remaining non-motor symptoms were not related to plasma melatonin levels.</p>

<p>The temporal pattern of action potentials can convey rich information in a variety of sensory systems. We describe a new non-invasive technique that enables precise, reliable generation of action potential patterns in tactile peripheral afferent neurons by brief taps on the skin. Using this technique, we demonstrate sophisticated coding of temporal information in the somatosensory system, that shows that perceived vibration frequency is not encoded in peripheral afferents as was expected by either their firing rate or the underlying periodicity of the stimulus. Instead, a burst gap or silent gap between trains of action potentials conveys frequency information. This opens the possibility of new encoding strategies that could be deployed to convey sensory information using mechanical or electrical stimulation in neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces, and may extend to senses beyond artificial encoding of aspects of touch. We argue that a focus on appropriate use of effective temporal coding offers more prospects for rapid improvement in the function of these interfaces than attempts to scale-up existing devices.</p>

<p>The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly understood and are still under debate. This has hindered the development of adaptive DBS (aDBS). For further progress in aDBS, more insight into the dynamics of PD is needed, which can be obtained using machine learning models. This study presents an approach that uses generative and discriminative machine learning models to more accurately estimate the symptom severity of patients and adjust therapy accordingly. A support vector machine is used as the representative algorithm for discriminative machine learning models, and the Gaussian mixture model is used for the generative models. Therapy is effected using the state estimates obtained from the machine learning models together with a fuzzy controller in a critic-actor control approach. Both machine learning model configurations achieve PD suppression to desired state in 7 out of 9 cases; most of which settle in under 2 s.</p>

Background<p>Non-invasive neuromodulation is an emerging therapy for children with early brain injury but is difficult to apply to preschoolers when windows of developmental plasticity are optimal. Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) decreases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability in adults but effects on the developing brain are unstudied.</p>Objective/Hypothesis<p>We aimed to determine the effects of tSMS on cortical excitability and motor learning in healthy children. We hypothesized that tSMS over right M1 would reduce cortical excitability and inhibit contralateral motor learning.</p>Methods<p>This randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, three-arm, cross-over trial enrolled 24 healthy children aged 10–18 years. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) assessed cortical excitability via motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and paired pulse measures. Motor learning was assessed via the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). A tSMS magnet (677 Newtons) or sham was held over left or right M1 for 30 min while participants trained the non-dominant hand. A linear mixed effect model was used to examine intervention effects.</p>Results<p>All 72 tSMS sessions were well tolerated without serious adverse effects. Neither cortical excitability as measured by MEPs nor paired-pulse intracortical neurophysiology was altered by tSMS. Possible behavioral effects included contralateral tSMS inhibiting early motor learning (p &lt; 0.01) and ipsilateral tSMS facilitating later stages of motor learning (p &lt; 0.01) in the trained non-dominant hand.</p>Conclusion<p>tSMS is feasible in pediatric populations. Unlike adults, tSMS did not produce measurable changes in MEP amplitude. Possible effects of M1 tSMS on motor learning require further study. Our findings support further exploration of tSMS neuromodulation in young children with cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>The sense of smell has been shown to deteriorate in patients with some neurodegenerative disorders. In Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), decreased ability to smell is associated with early disease stages. Thus, olfactory neurons in the nose and olfactory bulb (OB) may provide a window into brain physiology and pathophysiology to address the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Because nasal olfactory receptor neurons regenerate throughout life, the olfactory system offers a broad variety of cellular mechanisms that could be altered in AD, including odorant receptor expression, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in the olfactory epithelium, axonal targeting to the OB, and synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the OB. This review focuses on pathophysiological changes in the periphery of the olfactory system during the progression of AD in mice, highlighting how the olfactory epithelium and the OB are particularly sensitive to changes in proteins and enzymes involved in AD pathogenesis. Evidence reviewed here in the context of the emergence of other typical pathological changes in AD suggests that olfactory impairments could be used to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the early phases of the pathology.</p>

<p>Static magnetic fields have been shown to induce effects on the human brain. Different experiments seem to support the idea that moderate static magnetic field can exert some influence on the gating processes of the membrane channels. In this article we visit the order of magnitude of the energy magnetic terms associated with moderate applied field (between 10 and 200 milliteslas). It is shown that gradients of the Zeeman energy associated with the inhomogeneous applied fields can induce pressures of the order of 10<sup>–2</sup>Pa. The surface tension generated by the magnetic pressure, on the surface delimiting the brain region subject to relevant field and gradients, is found to range between 10<sup>–1</sup> and 1 mN⋅m<sup>–1</sup>. These pressures seem to be strong enough to interfere with the elastic and electrostatic energies involved in the channel activation-inactivation-deactivation mechanisms of biological membranes. It has been described that small mechanical force can activate voltage gated potassium channels. Moreover, stretch-activated ion channels are widely described in different biological tissues. Virtually, all these channels can modify their activity if stressed by a sufficient pressure delivered for enough time. We propose mechanical stimulation – possibly not exclusively – as a candidate mechanism how static magnetic field can produce effects in biological systems. It must be emphasized, that such field gradients were not previously proposed as a possible source of neural activity modification.</p>

<p>The technology for producing microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has been developing since the 1970s and extracellular electrophysiological recordings have become well established in neuroscience, drug screening and cardiology. MEAs allow monitoring of long-term spiking activity of large ensembles of excitable cells noninvasively with high temporal resolution and mapping its spatial features. However, their inability to register subthreshold potentials, such as intrinsic membrane oscillations and synaptic potentials, has inspired a number of laboratories to search for alternatives to bypass the restrictions and/or increase the sensitivity of microelectrodes. In this study, we present the fabrication and in vitro experimental validation of arrays of PEDOT:PSS-coated 3D ultramicroelectrodes, with the best-reported combination of small size and low electrochemical impedance. We observed that this type of microelectrode does not alter neuronal network biological properties, improves the signal quality of extracellular recordings and exhibits higher selectivity toward single unit recordings. With fabrication processes simpler than those reported in the literature for similar electrodes, our technology is a promising tool for study of neuronal networks.</p>

<p>Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are involved not only in hemostasis but also in the development of ischemic brain injury. In the present work, we examined in vivo effects of a new peptide (AP9) composing Asn<sup>47</sup>-Phen<sup>55</sup> of PAR1 “tethered ligand” generated by activated protein C. We chose a mouse model of photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia to assess AP9 effects in vivo. To reveal the molecular mechanism of AP9 action, mice lacking β-arrestin-2 were used. AP9 was injected intravenously once 10 min before PT at doses of 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg, or twice, that is, 10 min before and 1 h after PT at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Lesion volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and staining of brain sections with tetrazolium salt. Neurologic deficit was estimated using the cylinder and the grid-walk tests. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption was assessed by Evans blue dye extraction. Eosin-hematoxylin staining and immunohistochemical staining were applied to evaluate the number of undamaged neurons and activated glial cells in the penumbra. A single administration of AP9 (20 mg/kg), as well as its two injections (20 mg/kg), decreased brain lesion volume. A double administration of AP9 also reduced BBB disruption and neurological deficit in mice. We did not observe the protective effect of AP9 in mice lacking β-arrestin-2 after PT. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time protective properties of a PAR1 agonist peptide, AP9, in vivo. β-Arrestin-2 was required for the protective action of AP9 in PT-induced brain ischemia.</p>

<p>Similarly to human population imaging, there are several well-founded motivations for animal population imaging, the most notable being the improvement of the validity of statistical results by pooling a sufficient number of animal data provided by different imaging centers. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a multicenter animal study, sharing raw data from forty rats and processing pipelines between four imaging centers. As specific use case, we focused on T1 and T2 mapping of the healthy rat brain at 7T. We quantitatively report about the variability observed across two MR data providers and evaluate the influence of image processing steps on the final maps, using three fitting algorithms from three centers. Finally, to derive relaxation times from different brain areas, two multi-atlas segmentation pipelines from different centers were performed on two different platforms. Differences between the two data providers were 2.21% for T1 and 9.52% for T2. Differences between processing pipelines were 1.04% for T1 and 3.33% for T2. These maps, obtained in healthy conditions, may be used in the future as reference when exploring alterations in animal models of pathology.</p>

<p>Clinical multicenter imaging studies are frequent and rely on a wide range of existing tools for sharing data and processing pipelines. This is not the case for preclinical (small animal) studies. Animal population imaging is still in infancy, especially because a complete standardization and control of initial conditions in animal models across labs is still difficult and few studies aim at standardization of acquisition and post-processing techniques. Clearly, there is a need of appropriate tools for the management and sharing of data, post-processing and analysis methods dedicated to small animal imaging. Solutions developed for Human imaging studies cannot be directly applied to this specific domain. In this paper, we present the Small Animal Shanoir (SAS) solution for supporting animal population imaging using tools compatible with open data. The integration of automated workflow tools ensures accessibility and reproducibility of research outputs. By sharing data and imaging processing tools, hosted by SAS, we promote data preparation and tools for reproducibility and reuse, and participation in multicenter or replication “open science” studies contributing to the improvement of quality science in preclinical domain. SAS is a first step for promoting open science for small animal imaging and a contribution to the valorization of data and pipelines of reference.</p>

Background<p>Clinical tests for detecting central and peripheral shoulder fatigue are limited. The discrimination of these two types of fatigue is necessary to better adapt recovery intervention. The Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements describes the neuromotor impulse response using lognormal functions and has many applications in pathology detection. The ideal motor control is modeled and a change in the neuromuscular system is reflected in parameters extracted according to this theory.</p>Objective<p>The objective of this study was to assess whether a shoulder neuromuscular fatigue could be detected through parameters describing the theory, if there is the possibility to discriminate central from peripheral fatigue, and which handwriting test gives the most relevant information on fatigue.</p>Methods<p>Twenty healthy participants performed two sessions of fast stroke handwriting on a tablet, before and after a shoulder fatigue. The fatigue was in internal rotation for one session and in external rotation during the other session. The drawings consisted of simple strokes, triangles, horizontal, and vertical oscillations. Parameters of these strokes were extracted according to the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory. The evolution of each participant was analyzed through a U-Mann–Whitney test for individual comparisons. A Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup>-test and a U-Mann–Whitney test were also performed on all participants to assess the group evolution after fatigue. Moreover, a correlation among parameters was calculated through Spearman coefficients to assess intrinsic parameters properties of each handwriting test.</p>Results<p>Central and peripheral parameters were statistically different before and after fatigue with a possibility to discriminate them. Participants had various responses to fatigue. However, when considering the group, parameters related to the motor program execution showed significant increase in the handwriting tests after shoulder fatigue. The test of simple strokes permits to know more specifically where the fatigue comes from, whereas the oscillations tests were the most sensitive to fatigue.</p>Conclusion<p>The results of this study suggest that the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory is an innovative approach for fatigue detection with discrimination between the central and peripheral systems. Overall, there is a possibility to implement the setting for clinics and sports personalized follow-up.</p>

<p>Much is known about electroencephalograph (EEG) patterns during sleep, but until recently, it was difficult to study EEG patterns during conscious, awake behavior. Technological advances such as powerful wireless EEG systems have led to a renewed interest in EEG as a clinical and research tool for studying real-time changes in the brain. We report here the first normative study of EEG activity while healthy young adults completed a series of cognitive tests recently published by the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB), a commonly-used standardized measure of cognition primarily used in clinical populations. In this preliminary study using a wireless EEG system, we examined power spectral density (PSD) in four EEG frequency bands. During baseline and cognitive testing, PSD activity for the lower frequency bands (theta and alpha) was greater, relative to the higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), suggesting participants were relaxed and mentally alert. Alpha, beta and gamma activity was increased during a memory test compared to two other, less demanding executive function tests. Gamma activity was also inversely correlated with performance on the memory test, consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis which proposes that better cognitive performance may link with lower cortical energy consumption. In summary, our study suggests that cognitive performance is related to the dynamics of EEG activity in a normative young adult population.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00041">An Active Inference Approach to Modeling Structure Learning: Concept Learning as an Example Case</a></h4>

<p>Within computational neuroscience, the algorithmic and neural basis of structure learning remains poorly understood. Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning—and specifically state-space expansion and reduction—within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) “slots” that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning—associated with these slots—can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of “one-shot” generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer.</p>

<p>Conscious awareness plays a major role in human cognition and adaptive behavior, though its function in multisensory integration is not yet fully understood, hence, questions remain: How does the brain integrate the incoming multisensory signals with respect to different external environments? How are the roles of these multisensory signals defined to adhere to the anticipated behavioral-constraint of the environment? This work seeks to articulate a novel theory on conscious multisensory integration (CMI) that addresses the aforementioned research challenges. Specifically, the well-established contextual field (CF) in pyramidal cells and coherent infomax theory (Kay et al., 1998; Kay and Phillips, 2011) is split into two functionally distinctive integrated input fields: local contextual field (LCF) and universal contextual field (UCF). LCF defines the modulatory sensory signal coming from some other parts of the brain (in principle from anywhere in space-time) and UCF defines the outside environment and anticipated behavior (based on past learning and reasoning). Both LCF and UCF are integrated with the receptive field (RF) to develop a new class of contextually-adaptive neuron (CAN), which adapts to changing environments. The proposed theory is evaluated using human contextual audio-visual (AV) speech modeling. Simulation results provide new insights into contextual modulation and selective multisensory information amplification/suppression. The central hypothesis reviewed here suggests that the pyramidal cell, in addition to the classical excitatory and inhibitory signals, receives LCF and UCF inputs. The UCF (as a steering force or tuner) plays a decisive role in precisely selecting whether to amplify/suppress the transmission of relevant/irrelevant feedforward signals, without changing the content e.g., which information is worth paying more attention to? This, as opposed to, unconditional excitatory and inhibitory activity in existing deep neural networks (DNNs), is called conditional amplification/suppression.</p>

<p>Extracellular ATP and serotonin (5-HT) are powerful triggers of nociceptive firing in the meninges, a process supporting headache and whose cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The current study aimed to develop, with the neurosimulator NEURON, a novel approach to explore in silico the molecular determinants of the long-lasting, pulsatile nature of migraine attacks. The present model included ATP and 5-HT release, ATP diffusion and hydrolysis, 5-HT uptake, differential activation of ATP P2X or 5-HT3 receptors, and receptor subtype-specific desensitization. The model also tested the role of branched meningeal fibers with multiple release sites. Spike generation and propagation were simulated using variable contribution by potassium and sodium channels in a multi-compartment fiber environment. Multiple factors appeared important to ensure prolonged nociceptive firing potentially relevant to long-lasting pain. Crucial roles were observed in: (i) co-expression of ATP P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits; (ii) intrinsic activation/inactivation properties of sodium Nav1.8 channels; and (iii) temporal and spatial distribution of ATP/5-HT release sites along the branches of trigeminal nerve fibers. Based on these factors we could obtain either persistent activation of nociceptive firing or its periodic bursting mimicking the pulsating nature of pain. In summary, our model proposes a novel tool for the exploration of peripheral nociception to test the contribution of clinically relevant factors to headache including migraine pain.</p>

<p>Due to their postmitotic status, the potential for neurons to undergo senescence has historically received little attention. This lack of attention has extended to some non-postmitotic cells as well. Recently, the study of senescence within the central nervous system (CNS) has begun to emerge as a new etiological framework for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The presence of senescent cells is known to be deleterious to non-senescent neighboring cells via development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which includes the release of inflammatory, oxidative, mitogenic, and matrix-degrading factors. Senescence and the SASP have recently been hailed as an alternative to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the selective killing of senescence cells by senolytic drugs as a substitute for amyloid beta (Aß) targeting antibodies. Here we call for caution in rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis and to the dismissal of Aß antibody intervention at least in early disease stages, as Aß oligomers (AßO), and cellular senescence may be inextricably linked. We will review literature that portrays AßO as a stressor capable of inducing senescence. We will discuss research on the potential role of secondary senescence, a process by which senescent cells induce senescence in neighboring cells, in disease progression. Once this seed of senescent cells is present, the elimination of senescence-inducing stressors like Aß would likely be ineffective in abrogating the spread of senescence. This has potential implications for when and why AßO clearance may or may not be effective as a therapeutic for AD. The selective killing of senescent cells by the immune system via immune surveillance naturally curtails the SASP and secondary senescence outside the CNS. Immune privilege restricts the access of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma, making the brain a safe harbor for the spread of senescence and the SASP. However, an increasingly leaky blood brain barrier (BBB) compromises immune privilege in aging AD patients, potentially enabling immune infiltration that could have detrimental consequences in later AD stages. Rather than an alternative etiology, senescence itself may constitute an essential component of the cascade in the amyloid cascade hypothesis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00103">Differential Expression of Acid – Sensing Ion Channels in Mouse Primary Afferents in Naïve and Injured Conditions</a></h4>

<p>Injury and inflammation cause tissue acidosis, which is a common feature of various painful conditions. Acid-Sensing Ion channels (ASICs) are amongst the main excitatory channels activated by extracellular protons and expressed in the nervous system. Six transcripts of ASIC subunits including ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 are encoded by four genes (Asic1–4) and have been identified in rodents. Most ASIC subunits are present at substantial levels in primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) except for ASIC4. However, their expression pattern in DRG neurons remains largely unclear, mainly due to the lack of antibodies with appropriate specificity. In this study, we examined in detail the expression pattern of ASIC1-3 subunits, including splice variants, in different populations of DRG neurons in adult mice using an in situ hybridization technique (RNAscope) with high sensitivity and specificity. We found that in naïve condition, all five subunits examined were expressed in the majority of myelinated, NF200-immunoreactive, DRG neurons (NF200<sup>+</sup>). However, ASIC subunits showed a very different expression pattern among non-myelinated DRG neuronal subpopulations: ASIC1 and ASIC3 were only expressed in CGRP-immunoreactive neurons (CGRP<sup>+</sup>), ASIC2a was mostly expressed in the majority of IB4-binding neurons (IB4<sup>+</sup>), while ASIC2b was expressed in almost all non-myelinated DRG neurons. We also found that at least half of sensory neurons expressed multiple types of ASIC subunits, indicating prevalence of heteromeric channels. In mice with peripheral nerve injury, the expression level of ASIC1a and ASIC1b in L4 DRG and ASIC3 in L5 DRG were altered in CGRP<sup>+</sup> neurons, but not in IB4<sup>+</sup> neurons. Furthermore, the pattern of change varied among DRGs depending on their segmental level, which pointed to differential regulatory mechanisms between afferent types and anatomical location. The distinct expression pattern of ASIC transcripts in naïve condition, and the differential regulation of ASIC subunits after peripheral nerve injury, suggest that ASIC subunits are involved in separate sensory modalities.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00020">Structural Covariance Changes of Anterior and Posterior Hippocampus During Musical Training in Young Adults</a></h4>

<p>Musical training can induce the functional and structural changes of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous structure which can be divided into anterior and posterior parts along its longitudinal axis, and the whole-brain structural covariances of anterior (aHC) and posterior hippocampus (pHC) show distinct patterns in young adults. However, little is known about whether the anterior and posterior hippocampal structural covariances change after long-term musical training. Here, we investigated the musical training-induced changes of the whole-brain structural covariances of bilateral aHC and pHC in a longitudinal designed experiment with two groups (training group and control group) across three time points [the beginning (TP1) and the end (TP2) of 24 weeks of training, and 12 weeks after training (TP3)]. Using seed partial least square, we identified two significant patterns of structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The first showed common structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The second pattern revealed distinct structural covariance of the two regions and reflected the changes of structural covariance of the left pHC in the training group across three time points: the left pHC showed significant structural covariance with bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, left calcarine sulcus only at TP1 and TP3. Furthermore, the integrity of distinct structural networks of aHC and pHC in the second pattern significantly increased in the training group. Our findings suggest that musical training could change the organization of structural whole-brain covariance for left pHC and enhance the degree of the structural covariance network differentiation of the aHC and pHC in young adults.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is associated with deterioration of the sensorimotor system, which impairs balance and somatosensation. However, the exact age-related changes in the cortical processing of sensorimotor integration are unclear. This study investigated primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) oscillations in the 15–30 Hz beta band at rest and following (involuntary) rapid stretches to the triceps surae muscles (i.e., proprioceptive stimulation) of young and older adults. A custom-built, magnetoencephalography (MEG)-compatible device was used to deliver rapid (190°·s<sup>−1</sup>) ankle rotations as subjects sat passively in a magnetically-shielded room while MEG recorded their cortical signals. Eleven young (age 25 ± 3 years) and 12 older (age 70 ± 3 years) adults matched for physical activity level demonstrated clear 15–30 Hz beta band suppression and rebound in response to the stretches. A sub-sample (10 young and nine older) were tested for dynamic balance control on a sliding platform. Older adults had greater cortical beta power pre-stretch (e.g., right leg: 4.0 ± 1.6 fT vs. 5.6 ± 1.7 fT, P = 0.044) and, subsequently, greater normalized movement-related cortical beta suppression post-proprioceptive stimulation (e.g., right leg: −5.8 ± 1.3 vs. −7.6 ± 1.7, P = 0.01) than young adults. Furthermore, poorer balance was associated with stronger cortical beta suppression following proprioceptive stimulation (r = −0.478, P = 0.038, n = 19). These results provide further support that cortical processing of proprioception is hindered in older adults, potentially (adversely) influencing sensorimotor integration. This was demonstrated by the impairment of prompt motor action control, i.e., regaining perturbed balance. Finally, SM1 cortex beta suppression to a proprioceptive stimulus seems to indicate poorer sensorimotor functioning in older adults.</p>

Kauvar, Machado, et al. have developed a new method, COSMOS, to simultaneously record neural dynamics at ∼30 Hz from over a thousand near-cellular resolution neuronal sources spread across the entire dorsal neocortex of awake, behaving mice. With COSMOS, they observe cortex-spanning population encoding of actions during a three-option lick-to-target task.

The human guanylate binding protein (hGBP1) is a mechano-chemical GTPase of the dynamin family that hydrolyzes GTP to GMP in two consecutive cleavage steps. Xavier et al. demonstrate that, although GMP production is dispensable for the restriction of C. trachomatis growth, it is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Interferon (IFN) signaling within the CNS is critical for synaptic plasticity and processes of learning and memory formation under physiological conditions. Hosseini et al. provide evidence that the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) is mediating this effect via the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) in astrocytes by regulating synaptic glutamate levels.

Ménégaut et al. show that liver X receptor (LXR) agonists selectively increase IL1β mRNA levels independently of TLR activation. This effect, restricted to human macrophages, is mediated by an activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α through LXR. Accordingly, LXR agonists also potentiate other HIF-1α-dependent pathways, such as glycolysis.

Agarwal and Shendure show that deep neural networks can strongly predict mRNA abundance solely from promoter sequence. The residuals of these predictions facilitate inferences about the regulatory influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that CpG dinucleotide content at core promoters is associated with transcriptional activity.

Kaur and Aballay show that the G-protein-coupled receptor SRBC-48 functions cell autonomously in AWC neurons to protect from dendrite degeneration caused by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dendrite degeneration in AWC results in decreased longevity that may be due, in part, to hyperactivation of the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16.

The timely expression of cell cycle genes is finely controlled by specific transcriptional programs. In this study, Nourreddine et al. evaluate the role of RNA-binding proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes. They show that the NF45-NF90 complex regulates the expression of an important cluster of mitotic mRNAs.

Sorge et al. show that reduced expression of a single, small subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain induces a transcriptional stress response through ATF4. This adaptation re-programs metabolism in Drosophila epithelial progenitors toward a glycolytic metabolism. Ultimately, cells are stressed but more responsive to oncogenic signaling and tumorous overgrowth.

Goldman and colleagues report that transplanted human glial progenitor cells can migrate broadly within the adult brain, colonizing the host to functionally remyelinate demyelinated tissue, in both congenital and acquired models of dysmyelination. They then use RNA-seq to define how the transcriptional signatures of human GPCs change after demyelination-induced mobilization.

RNA editing is an essential cellular process mediated by ADARs, but few trans regulators are known. Freund et al. use BioID to identify ADAR interactors, including all DZF-domain-containing proteins. One of these, ILF3, is shown to be a global negative regulator of editing, establishing this family as influential editing regulators.

Nakatake et al. establish 714 transgene-inducible human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and capture global transcriptome changes perturbed by the overexpression of these transgenes—mostly transcription factors (TFs). The analyses help in classifying TFs and identify sets of TFs that direct the differentiation of hESCs into distinct cell types.

Sreenivasan et al. describe the necessity to remove a subpopulation of muscle stem cells by necroptosis for efficient regeneration of chronically damaged skeletal muscles. Muscle stem cells acquire a lowered threshold for necroptosis by attenuating recruitment of the repressive CHD4/NuRD complex to the Ripk3 promotor.

Zhang et al. demonstrate that RIPK3 RHIM is essential for necroptosis, which causes the embryonic lethality in Fadd-deficient mice. Compared with Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− mice, Ripk3V448P/V448PFadd−/− mice develop more severe lymphoproliferative disease, which is suppressed by RIPK1 deficiency, indicating that RIPK1 participates in RIPK3-mediated inflammatory response independent of the RIPK3 RHIM.

Sciamanna et al. show overt alterations in neuronal excitability of the globus pallidus in a dystonia mouse model. Pallidal neurons show impairments in firing rate and pattern, caused by altered dopamine D2 receptor control over GABAergic striatopallidal synapses with subsequent downregulation of HCN channels.

Ueda et al. reveal that intrauterine pressures produced by uterine smooth muscle contractions show the highest and most frequent periodic peaks just after mouse embryo implantation. Reichert’s membrane, a specialized basement membrane that wraps around the implanted embryo, plays a crucial role as a shock absorber of intrauterine pressures.

<p>by Jannes Jegminat, Maya A. Jastrzębowska, Matthew V. Pachai, Michael H. Herzog, Jean-Pascal Pfister</p>

Accumulating evidence indicates that the human brain copes with sensory uncertainty in accordance with Bayes’ rule. However, it is unknown how humans make predictions when the generative model of the task at hand is described by uncertain parameters. Here, we tested whether and how humans take parameter uncertainty into account in a regression task. Participants extrapolated a parabola from a limited number of noisy points, shown on a computer screen. The quadratic parameter was drawn from a bimodal prior distribution. We tested whether human observers take full advantage of the given information, including the likelihood of the quadratic parameter value given the observed points and the quadratic parameter’s prior distribution. We compared human performance with Bayesian regression, which is the (Bayes) optimal solution to this problem, and three sub-optimal models, which are simpler to compute. Our results show that, under our specific experimental conditions, humans behave in a way that is consistent with Bayesian regression. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that humans generate responses in a manner consistent with probability matching rather than Bayesian decision theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gszthWlCb3w" width="1" />

<p>by Abhishek Varghese, Christopher Drovandi, Antonietta Mira, Kerrie Mengersen</p>

The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is one of the most economically important vector-borne banana diseases throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin and presents a significant challenge to the agricultural sector. Current models of BBTV are largely deterministic, limited by an incomplete understanding of interactions in complex natural systems, and the appropriate identification of parameters. A stochastic network-based Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model has been created which simulates the spread of BBTV across the subsections of a banana plantation, parameterising nodal recovery, neighbouring and distant infectivity across summer and winter. Findings from posterior results achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate Bayesian computation suggest seasonality in all parameters, which are influenced by correlated changes in inspection accuracy, temperatures and aphid activity. This paper demonstrates how the model may be used for monitoring and forecasting of various disease management strategies to support policy-level decision making.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msPvB3YIBRs" width="1" />

<p>by Kai Zheng, Zhu-Hong You, Jian-Qiang Li, Lei Wang, Zhen-Hao Guo, Yu-An Huang</p>

Found in recent research, tumor cell invasion, proliferation, or other biological processes are controlled by circular RNA. Understanding the association between circRNAs and diseases is an important way to explore the pathogenesis of complex diseases and promote disease-targeted therapy. Most methods, such as <i>k</i>-mer and <i>PSSM</i>, based on the analysis of high-throughput expression data have the tendency to think functionally similar nucleic acid lack direct linear homology regardless of positional information and only quantify nonlinear sequence relationships. However, in many complex diseases, the sequence nonlinear relationship between the pathogenic nucleic acid and ordinary nucleic acid is not much different. Therefore, the analysis of positional information expression can help to predict the complex associations between circRNA and disease. To fill up this gap, we propose a new method, named iCDA-CGR, to predict the circRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce circRNA sequence information and quantifies the sequence nonlinear relationship of circRNA by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) technology based on the biological sequence position information for the first time in the circRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, our method achieved 0.8533 AUC, which was significantly higher than other existing methods. In the validation of independent data sets including circ2Disease, circRNADisease and CRDD, the prediction accuracy of iCDA-CGR reached 95.18%, 90.64% and 95.89%. Moreover, in the case studies, 19 of the top 30 circRNA-disease associations predicted by iCDA-CGR on circRDisease dataset were confirmed by newly published literature. These results demonstrated that iCDA-CGR has outstanding robustness and stability, and can provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uwMfW5XHIO0" width="1" />

<p>by Joseph Farris, Barbara Calhoun, Suhail Alam, Shaun Lee, Kasturi Haldar</p>

Monogenetic diseases provide unique opportunity for studying complex, clinical states that underlie neurological severity. Loss of glycine decarboxylase (<i>GLDC</i>) can severely impact neurological development as seen in non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). NKH is a neuro-metabolic disorder lacking quantitative predictors of disease states. It is characterized by elevation of glycine, seizures and failure to thrive, but glycine reduction often fails to confer neurological benefit, suggesting need for alternate tools to distinguish severe from attenuated disease. A major challenge has been that there are 255 unique disease-causing missense mutations in <i>GLDC</i>, of which 206 remain entirely uncharacterized. Here we report a Multiparametric Mutation Score (MMS) developed by combining <i>in silico</i> predictions of stability, evolutionary conservation and protein interaction models and suitable to assess 251 of 255 mutations. In addition, we created a quantitative scale of clinical disease severity comprising of four major disease domains (seizure, cognitive failure, muscular and motor control and brain-malformation) to comprehensively score patient symptoms identified in 131 clinical reports published over the last 15 years. The resulting patient Clinical Outcomes Scores (COS) were used to optimize the MMS for biological and clinical relevance and yield a patient Weighted Multiparametric Mutation Score (WMMS) that separates severe from attenuated neurological disease (p = 1.2 e-5). Our study provides understanding for developing quantitative tools to predict clinical severity of neurological disease and a clinical scale that advances monitoring disease progression needed to evaluate new treatments for NKH.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WR12eOYB0U8" width="1" />

<p>by Vincent Cabeli, Louis Verny, Nadir Sella, Guido Uguzzoni, Marc Verny, Hervé Isambert</p>

The precise diagnostics of complex diseases require to integrate a large amount of information from heterogeneous clinical and biomedical data, whose direct and indirect interdependences are notoriously difficult to assess. To this end, we propose an efficient computational approach to simultaneously compute and assess the significance of multivariate information between any combination of mixed-type (continuous/categorical) variables. The method is then used to uncover direct, indirect and possibly causal relationships between mixed-type data from medical records, by extending a recent machine learning method to reconstruct graphical models beyond simple categorical datasets. The method is shown to outperform existing tools on benchmark mixed-type datasets, before being applied to analyze the medical records of eldery patients with cognitive disorders from La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris. The resulting clinical network visually captures the global interdependences in these medical records and some facets of clinical diagnosis practice, without specific hypothesis nor prior knowledge on any clinically relevant information. In particular, it provides some physiological insights linking the consequence of cerebrovascular accidents to the atrophy of important brain structures associated to cognitive impairment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pHhrrFVoAqM" width="1" />

<p>by Yuan Zhao, Jacob L. Yates, Aaron J. Levi, Alexander C. Huk, Il Memming Park</p>

For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animal’s perceptual report. This phenomenon has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. The interpretation of choice-correlated activity is quite ambiguous, but its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings from the middle temporal (MT) area during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional latent factors that captured the population-wide fluctuations. We dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code. We found that the latent factors strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Surprisingly, we found that a large component of the choice information resides in the subspace orthogonal to the stimulus representation inconsistent with the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas. We hypothesize that this non-corrupting choice-correlated feedback might be related to learning or reinforcing sensory-motor relations in the sensory population.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i2p-pPqQmFM" width="1" />

<p>by Marie Berenguer, Karolin F. Meyer, Jun Yin, Gregg Duester</p>

Identification of target genes that mediate required functions downstream of transcription factors is hampered by the large number of genes whose expression changes when the factor is removed from a specific tissue and the numerous binding sites for the factor in the genome. Retinoic acid (RA) regulates transcription via RA receptors bound to RA response elements (RAREs) of which there are thousands in vertebrate genomes. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for epigenetic marks and RNA-seq on trunk tissue from wild-type and <i>Aldh1a2</i>-/- embryos lacking RA synthesis that exhibit body axis and forelimb defects. We identified a relatively small number of genes with altered expression when RA is missing that also have nearby RA-regulated deposition of histone H3 K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (gene activation mark) or histone H3 K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (gene repression mark) associated with conserved RAREs, suggesting these genes function downstream of RA. RA-regulated epigenetic marks were identified near RA target genes already known to be required for body axis and limb formation, thus validating our approach; plus, many other candidate RA target genes were found. Nuclear receptor 2f1 (<i>Nr2f1</i>) and nuclear receptor 2f2 (<i>Nr2f2</i>) in addition to Meis homeobox 1 (<i>Meis1</i>) and Meis homeobox <i>2</i> (<i>Meis2)</i> gene family members were identified by our approach, and double knockouts of each family demonstrated previously unknown requirements for body axis and/or limb formation. A similar epigenetic approach can be used to determine the target genes for any transcriptional regulator for which a knockout is available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IguCTmU-Yjs" width="1" />

Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:&gt;2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed &gt;400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human–yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r8aUy1SRxQo" width="1" />

<p>The teleost fish <i>Astyanax mexicanus </i> is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave <i>Astyanax </i> brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Astyanax mexicanus </i> is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral <i>Astyanax </i> are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave <i>Astyanax </i> using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with nonvisual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave <i>Astyanax </i> in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vertebrate locomotion is orchestrated by spinal interneurons making up a central pattern generator. Proper coordination of activity, both within and between segments, is required to generate the desired locomotor output. This coordination is altered during acceleration to ensure the correct recruitment of muscles for the chosen speed. The transcription factor <i>Dmrt3</i> has been proposed to shape the patterned output at different gaits in horses and mice. Here, we characterized <i>dmrt3a</i> mutant zebrafish, which showed a strong, transient, locomotor phenotype in developing larvae. During beat-and-glide swimming, mutant larvae showed fewer and shorter movements with decreased velocity and acceleration. Developmental compensation likely occurs as the analyzed behaviors did not differ from wild-type at older larval stages. However, analysis of maximum swim speed in juveniles suggests that some defects persist within the mature locomotor network of <i>dmrt3a</i> mutants. Our results reveal the pivotal role Dmrt3 neurons play in shaping the patterned output during acceleration in vertebrates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This mini‐review presents the view that contemporary approaches to stem the tide of opioid overdose deaths are insufficient to make a significant impact. Instead, a focus on the opioid receptor as the ultimate molecular target to directly abolish opioid overdose death is explored. After identifying the key brainstem neurons that control respiration which are inhibited by opioid drugs, genetic techniques targeting the <i>mu </i> opioid receptor are detailed which prevent opioid overdose. This receptor‐centric solution for the opioid overdose epidemic can be realized with existing technology and, with sufficient effort, could enter clinical trials within 5 to 10 years.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses <i>LacZ </i> under the control of an intragenic enhancer of <i>Dlx5 </i> and <i>Dlx6 </i> (<i>Dlx5/6‐LacZ </i>). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including <i>Calb2 </i> and <i>Nkx2.2 </i> ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls, and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00127">The Functional Role of Spinal Interneurons Following Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) impedes signal transmission by disrupting both the local neurons and their surrounding synaptic connections. Although the majority of SCI patients retain spared neural tissue at the injury site, they predominantly suffer from complete autonomic and sensorimotor dysfunction. While there have been significant advances in the characterization of the spared neural tissue following SCI, the functional role of injury-induced interneuronal plasticity remains elusive. In healthy individuals, spinal interneurons are responsible for relaying signals to coordinate both sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. However, the spontaneous synaptic loss following injury alters these intricate interneuronal networks in the spinal cord. Here, we propose the synaptopathy hypothesis of SCI based on recent findings regarding the maladaptive role of synaptic changes amongst the interneurons. These maladaptive consequences include circuit inactivation, neuropathic pain, spasticity, and autonomic dysreflexia. Recent preclinical advances have uncovered the therapeutic potential of spinal interneurons in activating the dormant relay circuits to restore sensorimotor function. This review will survey the diverse role of spinal interneurons in SCI pathogenesis as well as treatment strategies to target spinal interneurons.</p>

Chang et al. demonstrate that, at eye opening, three distinct representations of orientation exist in the ferret visual cortex: one each for monocular stimulation and a third for binocular stimulation. Through experience-dependent processes, a unified binocularly aligned orientation representation develops, driven by concerted shifts in monocular orientation preferences.

Tau, a microtubule-associated protein that modifies the dynamic properties and organization of microtubules in neurons and affects axonal transport, shows remarkable heterogeneity, with multiple isoforms (45–65 kDa) generated by alternative splicing. A high-molecular-weight (HMW) isoform (110 kDa) that contains an additional large exon termed 4a was discovered more than 25 years ago. This isoform, called Big tau, is expressed mainly in the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also in adult neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) that extend processes into the periphery.

The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.</p>

<p>by Tim Loossens, Merijn Mestdagh, Egon Dejonckheere, Peter Kuppens, Francis Tuerlinckx, Stijn Verdonck</p>

The human affect system is responsible for producing the positive and negative feelings that color and guide our lives. At the same time, when disrupted, its workings lie at the basis of the occurrence of mood disorder. Understanding the functioning and dynamics of the affect system is therefore crucial to understand the feelings that people experience on a daily basis, their dynamics across time, and how they can become dysregulated in mood disorder. In this paper, a nonlinear stochastic model for the dynamics of positive and negative affect is proposed called the Affective Ising Model (AIM). It incorporates principles of statistical mechanics, is inspired by neurophysiological and behavioral evidence about auto-excitation and mutual inhibition of the positive and negative affect dimensions, and is intended to better explain empirical phenomena such as skewness, multimodality, and non-linear relations of positive and negative affect. The AIM is applied to two large experience sampling studies on the occurrence of positive and negative affect in daily life in both normality and mood disorder. It is examined to what extent the model is able to reproduce the aforementioned non-Gaussian features observed in the data, using two sightly different continuous-time vector autoregressive (VAR) models as benchmarks. The predictive performance of the models is also compared by means of leave-one-out cross-validation. The results indicate that the AIM is better at reproducing non-Gaussian features while their performance is comparable for strictly Gaussian features. The predictive performance of the AIM is also shown to be better for the majority of the affect time series. The potential and limitations of the AIM as a computational model approximating the workings of the human affect system are discussed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9AUmWLqrtr0" width="1" />

<p>by Felix Roy, Matthieu Barbier, Giulio Biroli, Guy Bunin</p>

When can ecological interactions drive an entire ecosystem into a persistent non-equilibrium state, where many species populations fluctuate without going to extinction? We show that high-diversity spatially heterogeneous systems can exhibit chaotic dynamics which persist for extremely long times. We develop a theoretical framework, based on dynamical mean-field theory, to quantify the conditions under which these fluctuating states exist, and predict their properties. We uncover parallels with the persistence of externally-perturbed ecosystems, such as the role of perturbation strength, synchrony and correlation time. But uniquely to endogenous fluctuations, these properties arise from the species dynamics themselves, creating feedback loops between perturbation and response. A key result is that fluctuation amplitude and species diversity are tightly linked: in particular, fluctuations enable dramatically more species to coexist than at equilibrium in the very same system. Our findings highlight crucial differences between well-mixed and spatially-extended systems, with implications for experiments and their ability to reproduce natural dynamics. They shed light on the maintenance of biodiversity, and the strength and synchrony of fluctuations observed in natural systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SeW8ir14OPs" width="1" />

The human genome harbors a variety of genetic variations. Single-nucleotide changes that alter amino acids in protein-coding regions are one of the major causes of human phenotypic variation and diseases. These single-amino acid variations (SAVs) are routinely found in whole genome and exome sequencing. Evaluating the functional impact of such genomic alterations is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We developed DeepSAV, a deep-learning convolutional neural network to differentiate disease-causing and benign SAVs based on a variety of protein sequence, structural and functional properties. Our method outperforms most stand-alone programs, and the version incorporating population and gene-level information (DeepSAV+PG) has similar predictive power as some of the best available. We transformed DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs in the human population into a quantity termed “mutation severity measure” for each human protein-coding gene. It reflects a gene's tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. Genes implicated in cancer, autism, and viral interaction are found by this measure as intolerant to mutations, while genes associated with a number of other diseases are scored as tolerant. Among known disease-associated genes, those that are mutation-intolerant are likely to function in development and signal transduction pathways, while those that are mutation-tolerant tend to encode metabolic and mitochondrial proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WiZE8G7kv4s" width="1" />

<p>by Elsa Hansen, Jason Karslake, Robert J. Woods, Andrew F. Read, Kevin B. Wood</p>

Standard infectious disease practice calls for aggressive drug treatment that rapidly eliminates the pathogen population before resistance can emerge. When resistance is absent, this elimination strategy can lead to complete cure. However, when resistance is already present, removing drug-sensitive cells as quickly as possible removes competitive barriers that may slow the growth of resistant cells. In contrast to the elimination strategy, a containment strategy aims to maintain the maximum tolerable number of pathogens, exploiting competitive suppression to achieve chronic control. Here, we combine in vitro experiments in computer-controlled bioreactors with mathematical modeling to investigate whether containment strategies can delay failure of antibiotic treatment regimens. To do so, we measured the “escape time” required for drug-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations to eclipse a threshold density maintained by adaptive antibiotic dosing. Populations containing only resistant cells rapidly escape the threshold density, but we found that matched resistant populations that also contain the maximum possible number of sensitive cells could be contained for significantly longer. The increase in escape time occurs only when the threshold density—the acceptable bacterial burden—is sufficiently high, an effect that mathematical models attribute to increased competition. The findings provide decisive experimental confirmation that maintaining the maximum number of sensitive cells can be used to contain resistance when the size of the population is sufficiently large.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qYb_asQrd9M" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>In neuroscience, the structure of a circuit has often been used to intuit function—an inversion of Louis Kahn’s famous dictum, "Form follows function" (Kristan and Katz, 2006). However, different brain networks may use different network architectures to solve the same problem. The olfactory circuits of two insects, the locust, <i>Schistocerca americana,</i> and the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, serve the same function—to identify and discriminate odors. The neural circuitry that achieves this shows marked structural differences. Projection neurons (PNs) in the antennal lobe innervate Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body. In locust, each KC receives inputs from ~50% of PNs, a scheme that maximizes the difference between inputs to any two of ~50,000 KCs. In contrast, in <i>Drosophila</i>, this number is only 5% and appears suboptimal. Using a computational model of the olfactory system, we show that the activity of KCs is sufficiently high-dimensional that it can separate similar odors regardless of the divergence of PN–KC connections. However, when temporal patterning encodes odor attributes, dense connectivity outperforms sparse connections. Increased separability comes at the cost of reliability. The disadvantage of sparse connectivity can be mitigated by incorporating other aspects of circuit architecture seen in <i>Drosophila</i>. Our simulations predict that <i>Drosophila</i> and locust circuits lie at different ends of a continuum where the <i>Drosophila</i> gives up on the ability to resolve similar odors to generalize across varying environments, while the locust separates odor representations but risks misclassifying noisy variants of the same odor.</p>

Abstract
<p>Understanding the function of broadly projecting neurons depends on comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and targets of their axon collaterals. While retrograde tracers and, more recently, retrograde viral vectors have been used to identify efferent projections, they have limited ability to reveal the full pattern of axon collaterals from complex, heterogeneous neuronal populations. Here we describe TrAC (tracing axon collaterals), an intersectional recombinase-based viral-genetic strategy that allows simultaneous visualization of axons from a genetically defined neuronal population and a projection-based subpopulation. To test this new method, we have applied TrAC to analysis of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE)-containing neurons projecting to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) in laboratory mice. TrAC allowed us to label each projection-based LC-NE subpopulation, together with all remaining LC-NE neurons, in isolation from other noradrenergic populations. This analysis revealed mPFC-projecting and M1-projecting LC-NE subpopulations differ from each other and from the LC as a whole in their patterns of axon collateralization. Thus, TrAC complements and extends existing axon tracing methods by permitting analyses that have not previously been possible with complex genetically defined neuronal populations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5–E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing the hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 [PECAM1], vascular endothelial‐cadherin [VE‐cadherin] and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by <i>Griffonia simplicifolia </i> isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5–E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. <i>In vitro </i>, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5‐S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II‐IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II‐IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent hippocampus expresses a variety of neuronal network oscillations depending on the behavioral state of the animal. Locomotion and active exploration are accompanied by theta‐nested gamma oscillations while resting states and slow‐wave sleep are dominated by intermittent sharp wave‐ripple complexes. It is believed that gamma rhythms create a framework for efficient acquisition of information whereas sharp wave‐ripples are thought to be involved in consolidation and retrieval of memory. While not strictly mutually exclusive, one of the two patterns usually dominates in a given behavioral state. Here we explore how different input patterns induce either of the two network states, using an optogenetic stimulation approach in hippocampal brain slices of mice. We report that the pattern of the evoked oscillation depends strongly on the initial synchrony of activation of excitatory cells within CA3. Short, synchronous activation favors the emergence of sharp wave‐ripple complexes while persistent but less synchronous activity—as typical for sensory input during exploratory behavior—supports the generation of gamma oscillations. This dichotomy is reflected by different degrees of synchrony of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents within these two states. Importantly, the induction of these two fundamental network patterns does not depend on the presence of any neuromodulatory transmitter like acetylcholine, but is merely based on a different synchrony in the initial activation pattern.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted MRI scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our dataset, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely non‐overlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported, but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.</p>

<p>Though it is well known that chronic infections of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) can induce mental and behavioral disorders in the host, little is known about the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this pathological process. In this study, we employed an advanced lncRNAs and mRNAs integration chip (Affymetrix HTA 2.0) to detect the expression of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in T. gondii Chinese 1 strain infected mouse brain. As a result, for the first time, the downregulation of lncRNA-11496 (NONMMUGO11496) was identified as the responsible factor for this pathological process. We showed that dysregulation of lncRNA-11496 affected proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of mouse microglia. Furthermore, we proved that Mef2c (Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C), a member of the MEF2 subfamily, is the target gene of lncRNA-11496. In a more detailed study, we confirmed that lncRNA-11496 positively regulated the expression of Mef2c by binding to histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Importantly, Mef2c itself could coordinate neuronal differentiation, survival, as well as synapse formation. Thus, our current study provides the first evidence in terms of the modulatory action of lncRNAs in chronic toxoplasmosis in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a solid scientific basis for using lncRNA-11496 as a therapeutic target to treat T. gondii induced neurological disorder.</p>

<p>The striatum, the main input structure of the basal ganglia, is critical for action selection and adaptive motor control. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying these functions, an analysis of microcircuits that compose the striatum is necessary. Among these, cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) provide intrinsic striatal innervation whose dysfunction is implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Tourette syndrome. The ability to experimentally manipulate the activity of ChIs is critical to gain insights into their contribution to the normal function of the striatum and the emergence of behavioral abnormalities in pathological states. In this study, we generated and tested CAV-pChAT-GFP, a replication-defective canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence under the control of the human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter. We first tested the potential specificity of CAV-pChAT-GFP to label striatal ChIs in a rat before performing experiments on two macaque monkeys. In the vector-injected rat and monkey striatum, we found that GFP expression preferentially colocalized with ChAT-immunoreactivity throughout the striatum, including those from local circuit interneurons. CAV-2 vectors containing transgene driven by the ChAT promoter provide a powerful tool for investigating ChI contributions to circuit function and behavior in nonhuman primates.</p>

<p>Dopamine, alongside other neuromodulators, defines brain and neuronal states, inter alia through regulation of global and local mRNA translation. Yet, the signaling pathways underlying the effects of dopamine on mRNA translation and psychiatric disorders are not clear. In order to examine the molecular pathways downstream of dopamine receptors, we used genetic, pharmacologic, biochemical, and imaging methods, and found that activation of dopamine receptor D1 but not D2 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr<sup>56</sup> but not eIF2α in cortical primary neuronal culture in a time-dependent manner. NMDA receptor, mTOR, and ERK pathways are upstream of the D1 receptor-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation and essential for it. Furthermore, D1 receptor activation resulted in a major reduction in dendritic eEF2 phosphorylation levels. D1-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation results in an increase of BDNF and synapsin2b expression which was followed by a small yet significant increase in general protein synthesis. These results reveal the role of dopamine D1 receptor in the regulation of eEF2 pathway translation in neurons and present eEF2 as a promising therapeutic target for addiction and depression as well as other psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>A growing number of genes associated with Parkinson’s disease are implicated in the regulation of lysosome function, including LRRK2, whose missense mutations are perhaps the most common monogenic cause of this neurodegenerative disease. These mutations are collectively thought to introduce a pathologic increase in LRRK2 kinase activity, which is currently a major target for therapeutic intervention. Heterozygous carriers of many missense mutations in the GBA1 gene have dramatically increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. A critical question has recently emerged regarding the potential interplay between the proteins encoded by these two disease-linked genes. Our group has recently demonstrated that knockin mutation of a Parkinson’s-linked GBA1 variant induces severe lysosomal and cytokine abnormalities in murine astrocytes and that these deficits were normalized via inhibition of wild-type LRRK2 kinase activity in these cells. Another group independently found that LRRK2 inhibition increases glucocerebrosidase activity in wild-type human iPSC-derived neurons, as well as those whose activity is disrupted by GBA1 or LRRK2 mutation. Fundamental questions remain in terms of the lysosomal abnormalities and the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in human neurons deficient in glucocerebrosidase activity. Here, we further elucidate the physiological crosstalk between LRRK2 signaling and glucocerebrosidase activity in human iPSC-derived neurons. Our studies show that the allelic loss of GBA1 manifests broad defects in lysosomal morphology and function. Furthermore, our data show an increase in both the accumulation and secretion of oligomeric α-synuclein protein in these GBA1-heterozygous-null neurons, compared to isogenic controls. Consistent with recent findings in murine astrocytes, we observed that multiple indices of lysosomal dysfunction in GBA1-deficient human neurons were normalized by LRRK2 kinase inhibition, while some defects were preserved. Our findings demonstrate a selective but functional intersection between glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and LRRK2 signaling in the cell and may have implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Neuroergonomics is an emerging field that investigates the human brain about behavioral performance in natural environments and everyday settings. This study investigated the body and brain activity correlates of a typical daily activity, hot beverage preparation, and consumption in a realistic office environment where participants performed natural daily tasks. Using wearable, battery operated and wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, neural and physiological responses were measured in untethered, freely moving participants who prepared hot beverages using two different machines (a market leader and follower as determined by annual US sales). They later consumed the drinks they had prepared in three blocks. Emotional valence was estimated using frontal asymmetry in EEG alpha band power and emotional arousal was estimated from EDA tonic and phasic activity. Results from 26 participants showed that the market-leading coffee machine was more efficient to use based on self-reports, behavioral performance measures, and there were significant within-subject differences in valence between the two machine use. Moreover, the market leader user interface led to greater self-reported product preference, which was further supported by significant differences in measured arousal and valence (EDA and EEG, respectively) during coffee production and consumption. This is the first study that uses a multimodal and comprehensive assessment of coffee machine use and beverage consumption in a naturalistic work environment. Approaches described in this study can be adapted in the future to other task-specific machine usability and consumer neuroscience studies.</p>

<p>Despite state-of-the-art surgical and postoperative treatment, median nerve transection causes lasting impaired hand function due to limitations in the nerve’s reinnervation ability. The defective innervation and thus controllability of the affected hand can shape the brain’s control of manual behaviors. Earlier studies of changes in the processing of tactile stimuli have focused mainly on stimulation of the reinnervated hand and lack sufficient control over the brain’s use of the tactile input in perceptual terms. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity (BOLD-signal) in 11 people with median nerve injury and healthy controls (N = 11) when performing demanding tactile tasks using the tip of either the index or little finger of either hand. For the nerve-injured group, the left median nerve had been traumatically transected in the distal forearm and surgically repaired on average 8 years before the study. The hand representation of their contralesional (right) primary somatosensory cortex (S1) showed greater activity compared to controls when the left reinnervated index finger was used, but also when the left-hand little finger and the fingers of the right hand innervated by uninjured nerves were used. We argue that the overall increase in activity reflects a general disinhibition of contralesional S1 consistent with an augmented functional reorganizational plasticity being an ongoing feature of chronic recovery from nerve injury. Also, the nerve-injured showed increased activity within three prefrontal cortical areas implicated in higher-level behavioral processing (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), suggesting that processes supporting decision-making and response-selection were computationally more demanding due to the compromised tactile sensibility.</p>

<p>Cluster headache (CH) is among the most common and debilitating autonomic cephalalgias. We characterize clinical outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the posterior hypothalamic region through a novel analysis of the electrophysiological topography and tractography-based structural connectivity. The left posterior hypothalamus was targeted ipsilateral to the refractory CH symptoms. Intraoperatively, field potentials were captured in 1 mm depth increments. Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was conducted to assess the structural connectivity of the estimated volume of activated tissue (VAT) associated with therapeutic response. Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic region led to the resolution of CH symptoms, and this benefit has persisted for 1.5-years post-surgically. Active contacts were within the posterior hypothalamus and dorsoposterior border of the ventral anterior thalamus (VAp). Delta- (3 Hz) and alpha-band (8 Hz) powers increased and peaked with proximity to the posterior hypothalamus. In the posterior hypothalamus, the delta-band phase was coupled to beta-band amplitude, the latter of which has been shown to increase during CH attacks. Finally, we identified that the VAT encompassing these regions had a high proportion of streamlines of pain processing regions, including the insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus, and the brainstem. Our unique case study of posterior hypothalamic region DBS supports durable efficacy and provides a platform using electrophysiological topography and structural connectivity, to improve mechanistic understanding of CH and this promising therapy.</p>

Background<p>Endogenous paired associative stimulation (ePAS) is a neuromodulatory intervention that has potential to aid stroke recovery. ePAS involves pairing endogenous electroencephalography (EEG) signals known as movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), with peripheral electrical stimulation. Previous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate changes in corticomotor excitability following ePAS. However, the use of TMS as a measure in stroke research is limited by safety precautions, intolerance, and difficulty generating a measurable response in more severely affected individuals. We were interested in evaluating the effect of ePAS using more feasible measures in people with stroke. This study asks whether ePAS produces immediate improvements in the primary outcomes of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and total neuromuscular fatigue of the dorsiflexor muscles, and in the secondary outcomes of muscle power, voluntary activation (VA), central fatigue, peripheral fatigue, and electromyography activity.</p>Method<p>In this repeated-measures cross-over study, 15 participants with chronic stroke completed two interventions, ePAS and sham, in a randomized order. During ePAS, 50 repetitions of visually cued dorsiflexion were completed, while single pulses of electrical stimulation were delivered to the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve. Each somatosensory volley was timed to arrive in the primary motor cortex at the peak negativity of the MRCP. Univariate and multivariate linear mixed models were used to analyze the primary and secondary data, respectively.</p>Results<p>There was a statistically significant increase in dorsiflexor MVIC immediately following the ePAS intervention (mean increase 7 N), compared to the sham intervention (mean change 0 N) (univariate between-condition analysis p = 0.047). The multivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of ePAS on VA of the tibialis anterior muscle, such that ePAS increased VA by 7 percentage units (95% confidence interval 1.3–12.7%). There was no statistically significant effect on total neuromuscular fatigue, muscle power, or other secondary measures.</p>Conclusion<p>A single session of ePAS can significantly increase isometric muscle strength and VA in people with chronic stroke. The findings confirm that ePAS has a central neuromodulatory mechanism and support further exploration of its potential as an adjunct to stroke rehabilitation. In addition, the findings offer alternative, feasible outcome measures for future research.</p>Clinical trial registration<p>Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12617000838314 (www.anzctr.org.au), Universal Trial Number U111111953714.</p>

<p>Magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) offers a non-invasive alternative for defining preoperative language lateralization in neurosurgery patients. MEGI indeed can be used for accurate estimation of language lateralization with a complex language task – auditory verb generation. However, since language function may vary considerably in patients with focal lesions, it is important to optimize MEGI for estimation of language function with other simpler language tasks. The goal of this study was to optimize MEGI laterality analyses for two such simpler language tasks that can have compliance from those with impaired language function: a non-word repetition (NWR) task and a picture naming (PN) task. Language lateralization results for these two tasks were compared to the verb-generation (VG) task. MEGI reconstruction parameters (regions and time windows) for NWR and PN were first defined in a presurgical training cohort by benchmarking these against laterality indices for VG. Optimized time windows and regions of interest (ROIs) for NWR and PN were determined by examining oscillations in the beta band (12–30 Hz) a marker of neural activity known to be concordant with the VG laterality index (LI). For NWR, additional ROIs include areas MTG/ITG and for both NWR and PN, the postcentral gyrus was included in analyses. Optimal time windows for NWR were defined as 650–850 ms (stimulus-locked) and −350 to −150 ms (response-locked) and for PN −450 to −250 ms (response-locked). To verify the optimal parameters defined in our training cohort for NWR and PN, we examined an independent validation cohort (n = 30 for NWR, n = 28 for PN) and found high concordance between VG laterality and PN laterality (82%) and between VG laterality and NWR laterality (87%). Finally, in a test cohort (n = 8) that underwent both the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) test and MEG for VG, NWR, and PN, we identified excellent concordance (100%) with IAP for VG + NWR + PN composite LI, high concordance for PN alone (87.5%), and moderate concordance for NWR alone (66.7%). These findings provide task options for non-invasive language mapping with MEGI that can be calibrated for language abilities of individual patients. Results also demonstrate that more accurate estimates can be obtained by combining laterality estimates obtained from multiple tasks. MEGI</p>

<p>Human arm movements are highly stereotypical under a large variety of experimental conditions. This is striking due to the high redundancy of the human musculoskeletal system, which in principle allows many possible trajectories toward a goal. Many researchers hypothesize that through evolution, learning, and adaption, the human system has developed optimal control strategies to select between these possibilities. Various optimality principles were proposed in the literature that reproduce human-like trajectories in certain conditions. However, these studies often focus on a single cost function and use simple torque-driven models of motion generation, which are not consistent with human muscle-actuated motion. The underlying structure of our human system, with the use of muscle dynamics in interaction with the control principles, might have a significant influence on what optimality principles best model human motion. To investigate this hypothesis, we consider a point-to-manifold reaching task that leaves the target underdetermined. Given hypothesized motion objectives, the control input is generated using Bayesian optimization, which is a machine learning based method that trades-off exploitation and exploration. Using numerical simulations with Hill-type muscles, we show that a combination of optimality principles best predicts human point-to-manifold reaching when accounting for the muscle dynamics.</p>

<p>Our aim is to propose an efficient algorithm for enhancing the contrast of dark images based on the principle of stochastic resonance in a global feedback spiking network of integrate-and-fire neurons. By linear approximation and direct simulation, we disclose the dependence of the peak signal-to-noise ratio on the spiking threshold and the feedback coupling strength. Based on this theoretical analysis, we then develop a dynamical system algorithm for enhancing dark images. In the new algorithm, an explicit formula is given on how to choose a suitable spiking threshold for the images to be enhanced, and a more effective quantifying index, the variance of image, is used to replace the commonly used measure. Numerical tests verify the efficiency of the new algorithm. The investigation provides a good example for the application of stochastic resonance, and it might be useful for explaining the biophysical mechanism behind visual perception.</p>

<p>Fluorescence calcium imaging using a range of microscopy approaches, such as two-photon excitation or head-mounted “miniscopes,” is one of the preferred methods to record neuronal activity and glial signals in various experimental settings, including acute brain slices, brain organoids, and behaving animals. Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P, and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As two-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data optimally and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions, namely NoRMCorre and CaImAn, for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction, and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software package, which we named EZcalcium.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00019">A Probabilistic Framework for Decoding Behavior From in vivo Calcium Imaging Data</a></h4>

<p>Understanding the role of neuronal activity in cognition and behavior is a key question in neuroscience. Previously, in vivo studies have typically inferred behavior from electrophysiological data using probabilistic approaches including Bayesian decoding. While providing useful information on the role of neuronal subcircuits, electrophysiological approaches are often limited in the maximum number of recorded neurons as well as their ability to reliably identify neurons over time. This can be particularly problematic when trying to decode behaviors that rely on large neuronal assemblies or rely on temporal mechanisms, such as a learning task over the course of several days. Calcium imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators has overcome these two issues. Unfortunately, because calcium transients only indirectly reflect spiking activity and calcium imaging is often performed at lower sampling frequencies, this approach suffers from uncertainty in exact spike timing and thus activity frequency, making rate-based decoding approaches used in electrophysiological recordings difficult to apply to calcium imaging data. Here we describe a probabilistic framework that can be used to robustly infer behavior from calcium imaging recordings and relies on a simplified implementation of a naive Baysian classifier. Our method discriminates between periods of activity and periods of inactivity to compute probability density functions (likelihood and posterior), significance and confidence interval, as well as mutual information. We next devise a simple method to decode behavior using these probability density functions and propose metrics to quantify decoding accuracy. Finally, we show that neuronal activity can be predicted from behavior, and that the accuracy of such reconstructions can guide the understanding of relationships that may exist between behavioral states and neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Electroacupuncture (EA) is a safe and effective therapy for ischemic stroke in both clinical and laboratory settings. However, the underlying mechanism behind EA treatment for stroke remains unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether EA treatment at the acupoints of Zusanli (ST36) and Quchi (LI11) exerted a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke rats by modulating autophagy and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. EA was performed at 24 h following brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) for 30 min per day for 3 days. Our results indicated that EA treatment significantly decreased neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volume in ischemic stroke rats. Also, EA intervention markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis by suppressing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 (CCAS3) at 72 h following I/R, as shown by a Western blot analysis. Furthermore, EA treatment after ischemic stroke suppressed the ischemia activated expression level of LC3II/I and Atg7 and increased the ischemia inhibited expression level of PI3K, phosphorylation of mTOR, phosphorylation of AKT, P62 and LAMP1, hence mediating the autophagy level of the neurocyte, which was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor Dactolisib. In summary, our results indicate that the protective effects of EA treatment at points of Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) in rats following cerebral I/R injury was associated with the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and autophagy via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Human brain organoids cultured from human pluripotent stem cells provide a promising platform to recapitulate histological features of the human brain and model neural disorders. However, unlike animal models, brain organoids lack a reproducible topographic organization, which limits their application in modeling intricate biology, such as the interaction between different brain regions. To overcome these drawbacks, brain organoids have been pre-patterned into specific brain regions and fused to form an assembloid that represents reproducible models recapitulating more complex biological processes of human brain development and neurological diseases. This approach has been applied to model interneuron migration, neuronal projections, tumor invasion, oligodendrogenesis, forebrain axis establishment, and brain vascularization. In this review article, we will summarize the usage of this technology to understand the fundamental biology underpinning human brain development and disorders.</p>

<p>Trauma or neurodegenerative diseases trigger the retrograde death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing an irreversible functional loss. AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, has been shown to play crucial roles in cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration. However, its function in adult RGC regeneration remains elusive. Here, we show that optic nerve injury induces dynamic changes of Arid1a expression. Importantly, deleting Arid1a in mice dramatically promotes RGC survival, but insignificantly impacts axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Next, joint profiling of transcripts and accessible chromatin in mature RGCs reveals that Arid1a regulates several genes involved in apoptosis and JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Thus, our findings suggest modulation of Arid1a as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote RGC neuroprotection after damage.</p>

<p>Sensory epithelia of the inner ear contain mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and glia-like supporting cells (SCs), both of which are required for hearing and balance functions. Each of these cell types has unique responses to ototoxic and cytoprotective stimuli. Non-lethal heat stress in the mammalian utricle induces heat shock proteins (HSPs) and protects against ototoxic drug-induced hair cell death. Induction of HSPs in the utricle demonstrates cell-type specificity at the protein level, with HSP70 induction occurring primarily in SCs, while HSP32 (also known as heme oxygenase 1, HMOX1) is induced primarily in resident macrophages. Neither of these HSPs are robustly induced in HCs, suggesting that HCs may have little capacity for induction of stress-induced protective responses. To determine the transcriptional responses to heat shock of these different cell types, we performed cell-type-specific transcriptional profiling using the RiboTag method, which allows for immunoprecipitation (IP) of actively translating mRNAs from specific cell types. RNA-Seq differential gene expression analyses demonstrated that the RiboTag method identified known cell type-specific markers as well as new markers for HCs and SCs. Gene expression differences suggest that HCs and SCs exhibit differential transcriptional heat shock responses. The chaperonin family member Cct8 was significantly enriched only in heat-shocked HCs, while Hspa1l (HSP70 family), and Hspb1 and Cryab (HSP27 and HSP20 families, respectively) were enriched only in SCs. Together our data indicate that HCs exhibit a limited but unique heat shock response, and SCs exhibit a broader and more robust transcriptional response to protective heat stress.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative disorders (ND) are characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of neurons. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most incident age-related ND, in which the presence of a chronic inflammatory compound seems to be related to its pathogenesis. Different stimuli in the central nervous system (CNS) can induce activation, proliferation, and changes in phenotype and glial function, which can be modulated by anti-inflammatory agents. Apigenin (4,5,7–trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid found in abundance in many fruits and vegetables, that has shown important effects upon controlling the inflammatory response. This study evaluated the neuroprotective and neuroimmunomodulatory potential of apigenin using in vitro models of neuroinflammation associated with AD. Co-cultures of neurons and glial cells were obtained from the cortex of newborn and embryonic Wistar rats. After 26 days in vitro, cultures were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, or to Aβ oligomers (500 nM) for 4 h, and then treated with apigenin (1 μM) for further 24 h. It was observed that the treatment with apigenin preserved neurons and astrocytes integrity, determined by Rosenfeld’s staining and immunocytochemistry for β-tubulin III and GFAP, respectively. Moreover, it was observed by Fluoro-Jade-B and caspase-3 immunostaining that apigenin was not neurotoxic and has a neuroprotective effect against inflammatory damage. Additionally, apigenin reduced microglial activation, characterized by inhibition of proliferation (BrdU+ cells) and modulation of microglia morphology (Iba-1 + cells), and decreased the expression of the M1 inflammatory marker CD68. Moreover, as determined by RT-qPCR, inflammatory stimuli induced by IL-1β increased the mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL5, and decreased the mRNA expression of IL-10. Contrary, after treatment with apigenin in inflammatory stimuli (IL-1β or LPS) there was a modulation of the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reduced expression of OX42, IL-6 and gp130. Moreover, apigenin alone and after an inflammatory stimulus with IL-1β also induced the increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an effect that may be associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Together these data demonstrate that apigenin presents neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and might represent an important neuroimmunomodulatory agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

Neural tube defects (NTDs) represent a failure of the neural plate to complete the developmental transition to a neural tube. NTDs are the most common birth anomaly of the CNS. Following mandatory folic acid fortification of dietary grains, a dramatic reduction in the incidence of NTDs was observed in areas where the policy was implemented, yet the genetic drivers of NTDs in humans, and the mechanisms by which folic acid prevents disease, remain disputed. Here, we discuss current understanding of human NTD genetics, recent advances regarding potential mechanisms by which folic acid might modify risk through effects on the epigenome and transcriptome, and new approaches to study refined phenotypes for a greater appreciation of the developmental and genetic causes of NTDs.

The glymphatic concept along with the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels have, in recent years, highlighted that fluid is directionally transported within the central nervous system (CNS). Imaging studies, as well as manipulations of fluid transport, point to a key role of the glymphatic–lymphatic system in clearance of amyloid-β and other proteins. As such, the glymphatic–lymphatic system represents a new target in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Not unexpectedly, introduction of a new plumbing system in the brain has stirred controversies.

<p>by Guang Song</p>

Mass-spring models have been a standard approach in molecular modeling for the last few decades, such as elastic network models (ENMs) that are widely used for normal mode analysis. In this work, we present a vastly different elastic solid model (ESM) of macromolecules that shares the same simplicity and efficiency as ENMs in producing the equilibrium dynamics and moreover, offers some significant new features that may greatly benefit the research community. ESM is different from ENM in that it treats macromolecules as elastic solids. Our particular version of ESM presented in this work, named <i>α</i>ESM, captures the shape of a given biomolecule most economically using <i>alpha shape</i>, a well-established technique from the computational geometry community. Consequently, it can produce most economical coarse-grained models while faithfully preserving the shape and thus makes normal mode computations and visualization of extremely large complexes more manageable. Secondly, as a solid model, ESM’s close link to finite element analysis renders it ideally suited for studying mechanical responses of macromolecules under external force. Lastly, we show that ESM can be applied also to structures without atomic coordinates such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. The complete MATLAB code of <i>α</i>ESM is provided.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qWtezuvCimM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a non‐linear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category’s perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In non‐primates, there is evidence for CP for sound and colour discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish <i>Pomacentrus amboinensis. </i> Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain datasets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering uni‐modal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal datasets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be re‐assembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4<i>% </i> per axis dimension; in contrast, b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1<i>% </i> per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.</p>

<p>Chronic neuroinflammation has long been hypothesized to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression. Previous research suggests that both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory microglia ameliorate amyloid pathology, but the latter worsen tau pathology. In this study, we sought to determine whether induction of arginase-1 positive microglia with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 modulates pathology in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Our findings indicate that a single intracranial IL-4 injection positively modulated performance of 3xTg AD mice in a Novel Object Recognition task, and locally increased the levels of arginase-1 positive myeloid cells when assessed one-week post injection. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased tau phosphorylation in IL-4 injected animals; however, we were not able to detect significant changes in tau phosphorylation utilizing Western blot. Lastly, IL-4 injection did not appear to cause significant changes in amyloid β load. In conclusion, acute intracranial IL-4 led to some positive benefits in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Although more work remains, these results support therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Objectives: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides significant benefits over classic TMS. Yet, the acquisition of individual structural magnetic resonance images (MRI<sub>individual</sub>) is a time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible prerequisite in all subjects for spatial tracking and anatomical guidance in nTMS studies. We hypothesize that spatial transformation can be used to adjust MRI templates to individual head shapes (MRI<sub>warped</sub>) and that TMS parameters do not differ between nTMS using MRI<sub>individual</sub> or MRI<sub>warped</sub>.</p><p>Materials and Methods: Twenty identical TMS sessions, each including four different navigation conditions, were conducted in 10 healthy subjects (one female, 27.4 ± 3.8 years), i.e., twice per subject by two researchers to additionally assess interrater reliabilities. MRI<sub>individual</sub> were acquired for all subjects. MRI<sub>warped</sub> were obtained through the spatial transformation of a template MRI following a 5-, 9-and 36-point head surface registration (MRI<sub>warped_5</sub>, MRI<sub>warped_9</sub>, MRI<sub>warped_36</sub>). Stimulation hotspot locations, resting motor threshold (RMT), 500 μV motor threshold (500 μV-MT), and mean absolute motor evoked potential difference (MAD) of primary motor cortex (M1) examinations were compared between nTMS using either MRI<sub>warped</sub> variants or MRI<sub>individual</sub> and non-navigated TMS.</p><p>Results: M1 hotspots were spatially consistent between MRI<sub>individual</sub> and MRI<sub>warped_36</sub> (insignificant deviation by 4.79 ± 2.62 mm). MEP thresholds and variance were also equivalent between MRI<sub>individual</sub> and MRI<sub>warped_36</sub> with mean differences of RMT by −0.05 ± 2.28% maximum stimulator output (%MSO; t<sub>(19)</sub> = −0.09, p = 0.923), 500 μV-MT by −0.15 ± 1.63%MSO (t<sub>(19)</sub> = −0.41, p = 0.686) and MAD by 70.5 ± 214.38 μV (t<sub>(19)</sub> = 1.47, p = 0.158). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of motor thresholds were between 0.88 and 0.97.</p><p>Conclusions: NTMS examinations of M1 yield equivalent topographical and functional results using MRI<sub>individual</sub> and MRI<sub>warped</sub> if a sufficient number of registration points are used.</p>
