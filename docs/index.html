<p>The main objective of this work was to obtain detailed information on the distribution and localization of the spexin (Spx) system in the sea bass brain. To this purpose, we first identified and characterized the <i>spx1</i> gene and analyzed its expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of the European sea bass by using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Then, we mapped the Spx1 system by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against mammalian SPX, and finally we determined its interaction with other reproductive-related neuroendocrine systems by using double immunohistochemistry and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih), prepro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh1), -(Gnrh2) and -(Gnrh3) antisera. The results obtained suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spexin (Spx) is a recently characterized neuropeptide implicated in multiple physiological processes in vertebrates, including reproduction, food intake, and regulation of anxiety and stress. Two orthologs (Spx1 and Spx2) are present in some nonmammalian vertebrates, including teleosts. However, information on the distribution of Spx in the brain and its interactions with other neuroendocrine systems in fish is still scarce. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) Spx1, which included a 27 aa signal peptide and a mature peptide of 14 aa that is C-terminal amidated. <i>spx1</i> transcripts were higher in the diencephalon/caudal preoptic area/hypothalamus and medulla but were also detected in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon/rostral preoptic area, optic tectum/tegmentum, cerebellum/pons, and pituitary. The immunohistochemical study revealed Spx1-immunoreactive (ir) cells in different nuclei of the preoptic area, habenula, prethalamus, mesencephalic tegmentum and in the proximal <i>pars distalis</i> (PPD) and <i>pars intermedia</i> of the pituitary. Spx1-ir fibers were widely distributed throughout the brain being particularly abundant in the midbrain and hindbrain, in close contact with tegmental gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) cells and isthmic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih) cells of the secondary gustatory nucleus. Moreover, Gnih fibers were observed innervating Spx1-ir cells lying in several subdivisions of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and in the lateral nucleus of the valvula, whereas ventrolateral prethalamic Spx1-ir cells received immunopositive Gnrh2 fibers. In the pituitary, Gnrh1-ir fibers were observed closely associated with Spx1-ir cells of the PPD. These results suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gene expression profiling in trigeminal ganglia from Cntnap2-/- and Shank3b-/- mouse models of autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Sensory difficulties represent a crucial issue in the life of autistic individuals. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders describes both hyper- and hypo-responsiveness to sensory stimulation as a criterion for the diagnosis autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Among the sensory domain affected in ASD, altered responses to tactile stimulation represent the most commonly reported sensory deficits. Although tactile abnormalities have been reported in monogenic cohorts of patients and genetic mouse models of ASD, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Traditionally, autism research has focused on the central nervous system as the target to infer the neurobiological bases of such tactile abnormalities. Nonetheless, the peripheral nervous system represents the initial site of processing of sensory information and a potential site of dysfunction in the sensory cascade. Here we investigated the gene expression deregulation in the trigeminal ganglion (which directly receives tactile information from whiskers) in two genetic models of syndromic autism (Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice) at both adult and juvenile ages. We found several neuronal and non-neuronal markers involved in inhibitory, excitatory, neuroinflammatory and sensory neurotransmission to be differentially regulated within the trigeminal ganglia of both adult and juvenile Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice. These results may help in entangling the multifaced complexity of sensory abnormalities in autism and open avenues for the development of peripherally targeted treatments for tactile sensory deficits exhibited in ASD.

	<p>A specific interpretation of embodiment assigns a central role to the body representations (BR) in cognition. In the social cognition domain, BR could be pivotal in representing others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and states. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between different BR and social cognition, in terms of Theory of Mind (ToM), in the same sample of participants is missing. Here, this relationship was explored considering individual differences in the action-oriented BR (aBR), nonaction-oriented BR (NaBR), and subjective predisposition toward internal bodily sensations (interoceptive sensibility, ISe). Eighty-two healthy adults were given behavioral measures probing aBR, NaBR, ISe, and affective/cognitive ToM. The results suggest that NaBR, which mainly relies on exteroceptive signals, predicts individual differences in cognitive ToM, possibly because it can allow differentiating between the self and others. Instead, the negative association between affective ToM and ISe suggests that an alteration of the internal body state representation (i.e., over-reporting interoceptive sensations) can affect emotional processing in social contexts. The finding that distinct aspects of the body processing from within (ISe) and from the outside (NaBR) differently contribute to ToM provides empirical support to the BR role in social cognition and can be relevant for developing interventions in clinical settings.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Apart from Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), no biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of dementia have been established to date. Inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia subtypes, e.g., AD or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the context of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, white blood cell (WBC) populations and platelet counts, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), have emerged as biomarkers. Their clinical relevance in dementia, however, is currently only insufficiently investigated. In the present study, hematological and inflammatory parameters were measured in the peripheral blood of 97 patients admitted to the gerontopsychiatric ward of Hannover Medical School, a university hospital in Germany, for dementia assessment. The study population comprised 20 non-demented, depressed patients (control group) and 77 demented patients who were assigned to five different groups based on their underlying dementia etiology: AD, n = 33; vascular dementia, n = 12; mixed dementia, n = 21; FTD, n = 5; and Korsakoff syndrome, n = 6. We observed neither statistically significant differences regarding total WBC populations, platelet counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, nor CRP levels between the control group and the five dementia groups. CRP levels tended to be higher in patients with Korsakoff syndrome than in the control group and in AD patients. Thus, CRP could possibly play a role in the differential diagnosis of dementia. This should be investigated further in future prospective studies with larger sample sizes. WBC and platelet counts, by contrast, do not appear to be suitable biomarkers in the differential diagnosis of dementia.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks cause intracranial hypotension (SIH) and also may cause infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) but the rate of development among different CSF leak types and outcome of treatment are not known. We determined the time interval from SIH onset to iSS and the outcome of treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,589 patients with SIH underwent neuroimaging and iSS was detected in 57 (23 men and 34 women, mean age = 41.3 years [3.6%]). We examined the type of underlying CSF leak by various imaging modalities. Percutaneous and surgical procedures were used to treat the CSF leaks.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The iSS was detected in 46 (10.3%) of 447 patients with ventral CSF leaks, in 2 (3.9%) of 51 patients with dural ectasia, in 5 (2.6%) of 194 patients with CSF-venous fistulas, in 4 (0.9%) of 457 patients with simple meningeal diverticula, and in none of the 101 patients with lateral CSF leaks or the 339 patients with leaks of indeterminate origin (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The estimated median latency period from SIH onset to iSS was 126 months. Ventral CSF leaks could not be eliminated with percutaneous procedures in any patient and surgical repair was associated with low risk (&lt;5%) and resulted in resolution of the CSF leak in all patients in whom the exact site of the CSF leak could be determined. Other types of CSF leak were treated with percutaneous or surgical procedures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The iSS can develop in most types of spinal CSF leak, including CSF-venous fistulas, but mainly in chronic ventral CSF leaks, which require surgical repair. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in brain volumetric measures and retinal layer thicknesses following acute optic neuritis (AON) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), to investigate the process of trans-synaptic degeneration, and determine its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PwMS were recruited within 40 days of AON onset (n = 49), and underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging followed by longitudinal tracking for up to 5 years. A comparator cohort of PwMS without a recent episode of AON were similarly tracked (n = 73). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accelerated atrophy of the occipital gray matter (GM), calcarine GM, and thalamus was seen in the AON cohort, as compared with the non-AON cohort (−0.76% vs −0.22% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.01] for occipital GM, −1.83% vs −0.32% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.008] for calcarine GM, −1.17% vs −0.67% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.02] for thalamus), whereas rates of whole-brain, cortical GM, non-occipital cortical GM atrophy, and T2 lesion accumulation did not differ significantly between the cohorts. In the AON cohort, greater AON-induced reduction in ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thickness over the first year was associated with faster rates of whole-brain (r = 0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.04), white matter (r = 0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and thalamic (r = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) atrophy over the study period. Significant relationships were identified between faster atrophy of the subcortical GM and thalamus, with worse visual function outcomes after AON.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide <i>in-vivo</i> evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration following AON in PwMS, and suggest that trans-synaptic degeneration may be related to clinically-relevant visual outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) is reliably elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less explored is its specificity relative to other neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we find novel evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition typically lacking tau pathology. We performed a detailed evaluation to identify the clinical correlates of elevated p-tau<sub>181</sub> in ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were clinically or pathologically diagnosed with ALS (n = 130) or AD (n = 79), or were healthy non-impaired controls (n = 26). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate AD from ALS. Within ALS, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests compared analytes by presence/absence of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Spearman correlations tested associations between plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> and postmortem neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A Wilcoxon test showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was higher in ALS than controls (<i>W</i> = 2,600, <i>p</i> = 0.000015), and ROC analyses showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> poorly discriminated AD and ALS (AUC = 0.60). In ALS, elevated plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with LMN signs in cervical (<i>W</i> = 827, <i>p</i> = 0.0072), thoracic (<i>W</i> = 469, <i>p</i> = 0.00025), and lumbosacral regions (<i>W</i> = 851, <i>p</i> = 0.0000029). In support of LMN findings, plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord (rho = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not in the motor cortex (<i>p</i> = 0.41). Cerebrospinal spinal fluid p-tau<sub>181</sub> and plasma neurofilament light chain were included as reference analytes, and demonstrate specificity of findings.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found strong evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in ALS and may be a novel marker specific to LMN dysfunction. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:807–818</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau Mediates Synergistic Influence of Vascular Risk and Aβ on Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5 ± 8.0 years). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Aβ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET). Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6 ± 1.5 years) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0 ± 2.0 years) using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Aβ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and Aβ on greater ITC tau accumulation (<i>p</i> = 0.004), even in individuals with Aβ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Aβ on longitudinal tau (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and Aβ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Aβ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Aβ-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Effects of Brain Lesions Causing Central Poststroke Pain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to test whether lesions causing central poststroke pain (CPSP) are associated with a specific connectivity profile, whether these connections are associated with metabolic changes, and whether this network aligns with neuromodulation targets for pain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two independent lesion datasets were utilized: (1) subcortical lesions from published case reports and (2) thalamic lesions with metabolic imaging using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography. Functional connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was assessed using a normative connectome (n = 1,000), and connections specific to CPSP were identified. Metabolic changes specific to CPSP were also identified and related to differences in lesion connectivity. Therapeutic relevance of the network was explored by testing for alignment with existing brain stimulation data and by prospectively targeting the network with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 7 patients with CPSP.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lesion locations causing CPSP showed a specific pattern of brain connectivity that was consistent across two independent lesion datasets (spatial <i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Connectivity differences were correlated with postlesion metabolism (<i>r</i> = −0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The topography of this lesion-based pain network aligned with variability in pain improvement across 12 prior neuromodulation targets and across 32 patients who received rTMS to primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Prospectively targeting this network with rTMS improved CPSP in 6 of 7 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing pain are connected to a specific brain network that shows metabolic abnormalities and promise as a neuromodulation target. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:834–845</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Brain Connectivity Predicts Chronic Pain in Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Previous studies have established the role of the cortico-mesolimbic and descending pain modulation systems in chronic pain prediction. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acute pain model where chronic pain is prevalent and complicated for prediction. In this study, we set out to study whether functional connectivity (FC) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is predictive of pain chronification in early-acute mTBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To estimate FC, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 105 participants with mTBI following a motor vehicle collision was acquired within 72 hours post-accident. Participants were classified according to pain ratings provided at 12-months post-collision into chronic pain (head/neck pain ≥30/100, n = 44) and recovery (n = 61) groups, and their FC maps were compared.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chronic pain group exhibited reduced negative FC between NAc and a region within the primary motor cortex corresponding with the expected representation of the area of injury. A complementary pattern was also demonstrated between PAG and the primary somatosensory cortex. PAG and NAc also shared increased FC to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) within the recovery group. Brain connectivity further shows high classification accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = .86) for future chronic pain, when combined with an acute pain intensity report.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FC features obtained shortly after mTBI predict its transition to long-term chronic pain, and may reflect an underlying interaction of injury-related primary sensorimotor cortical areas with the mesolimbic and pain modulation systems. Our findings indicate a potential predictive biomarker and highlight targets for future early preventive interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:819–833</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to its etiology. Remarkable progress has been made in deciphering disease etiology through genetic approaches, but there is limited data about how environmental and genetic factors interact to modify penetrance, risk, and disease severity. Here, we provide insights into environmental modifiers of PD, discussing precedents from other neurological and non-neurological conditions. Based on these examples, we outline genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD and review potential environmental modifiers of penetrance and clinical variability in monogenic and idiopathic PD. We also highlight the potential challenges and propose how future studies might tackle these important questions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:715–724</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Microglial Activation and Connectivity in Alzheimer Disease and Aging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, but increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation also plays a key role, driven by the activation of microglia. Aβ and tau pathology appear to spread along pathways of highly connected brain regions, but it remains elusive whether microglial activation follows a similar distribution pattern. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with microglia activation patterns.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 32 Aβ-positive early AD subjects (18 women, 14 men) and 18 Aβ-negative age-matched healthy controls (10 women, 8 men) from the prospective ActiGliA (Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease) study. All participants underwent microglial activation positron emission tomography (PET) with the third-generation mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure resting-state functional and structural connectivity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that inter-regional covariance in TSPO-PET and standardized uptake value ratio was preferentially distributed along functionally highly connected brain regions, with MRI structural connectivity showing a weaker association with microglial activation. AD patients showed increased TSPO-PET tracer uptake bilaterally in the anterior medial temporal lobe compared to controls, and higher TSPO-PET uptake was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia severity in a disease stage-dependent manner.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Microglial activation distributes preferentially along highly connected brain regions, similar to tau pathology. These findings support the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, and we speculate that pathology spreads throughout the brain along vulnerable connectivity pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Antibody Response to HML‐2 May Be Protective in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Reactivation of HERV-K(HML-2) has been found in subsets of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study examines the antibody response against HML-2 in ALS and analyzes its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Antibodies to HML-2 envelope (env) were analyzed using a peptide array for epitope mapping and by a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 242 healthy donors, and 243 ALS and 85 multiple sclerosis (MS) individuals. Extracellular levels of HML-2 were analyzed by digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Antibodies in the sera of ALS individuals recognized more HML-2 env peptides compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ALS individuals had higher levels of HML-2 than healthy donors (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and higher antibody levels against a select HML-2 env peptide compared to healthy donors or individuals with multiple sclerosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). 55.14% of ALS compared to 21.16% of healthy donors and 13.10% of MS individuals had antibodies against the HML-2 peptide (AUC = 0.769, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Levels of extracellular HML-2 DNA in serum (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the number of HML-2 env peptides recognized by ALS sera (<i>p</i> = 0.02) correlated with disease duration. Among ALS individuals, lower levels of HML-2 antibodies were associated with a definite diagnosis per EL Escorial criteria (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and with a lower predicted (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and observed survival (<i>p</i> = 0.03).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a differential antibody response against specific epitopes of HML-2 env in ALS and controls, suggesting epitope spreading, likely due to persistent antigenic exposure following reactivation of the viral genes. Low levels of antibodies to HML-2 env in ALS are associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival probability. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:782–792</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative neurological disorder with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the potential biomarkers implicated in the occurrence and progression of AD prior to clinical testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We selected 119 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 147,827 European participants. Summary data about AD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis with 63,926 European individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of blood metabolites with AD, and a phenome-wide MR analysis was further applied to ascertain the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four metabolites were identified as causal mediators for AD, including epiandrosterone sulfate (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.71; <i>p</i> = 6.14 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate (OR per SD increase: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; <i>p</i> = 1.98 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), sphingomyelin (OR per SD increase: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78–3.59; <i>p</i> = 2.10 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and glutamine (OR per SD increase: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; <i>p</i> = 2.09 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Phenome-wide MR analysis showed that epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate and sphingomyelin mediated the risk of multiple diseases, and glutamine had beneficial effects on the risk of 4 diseases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted increased epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate, and glutamine might be associated with a decreased risk of AD, while sphingomyelin was associated with an increased risk. Side-effect profiles were characterized to help inform drug target prioritization, and glutamine might be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of AD with no predicted detrimental side effects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45–55 deletion (del45–55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients, but the associated clinical variability and complications require clarification. We aimed to understand the phenotypes and potential modifying factors of this dystrophinopathy subset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study applied clinical and functional evaluation. Next generation sequencing was employed to identify intronic breakpoints and their impact on the <i>Dp140</i> promotor, intronic long noncoding RNA, and regulatory splicing sequences. DMD modifiers (<i>SPP1, LTBP4, ACTN3</i>) and concomitant mutations were also assessed. Haplotypes were built using <i>DMD</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms. Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of &gt;67% and traces of alternative del45–57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the <i>LTBP4</i> haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We confirmed that del45–55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the <i>LTBP4</i> modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed (1) to analyze salivary calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in patients with migraine, (2) to predict erenumab response from baseline CGRP levels, and (3) to evaluate CGRP change post-treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective observational study that measured salivary CGRP levels in healthy controls (HCs), patients with episodic migraine (EM) and patients with chronic migraine (CM). Participants collected saliva samples at baseline and, the patients who were candidates to receive erenumab, also collected saliva after 3 doses of treatment. We quantified CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and we performed an analysis at baseline and post-treatment through generalized linear mixed models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, a higher headache frequency was associated with higher CGRP levels, those being even higher in the presence of depressive symptoms. A cutoff point (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 103.93 (95% CI = 103.35–104.51) pg/ml was estimated to differentiate migraine from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC, 95% CI) of 0.801 (95% CI = 0.798–0.804). We also found that higher pretreatment salivary CGRP levels were statistically significantly associated to a higher probability of having 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency in patients with EM, but not in patients with CM. After 12 weeks of treatment with erenumab, salivary CGRP levels from patients within all spectrum of migraine frequency converged to similar CGRP values. In contrast, in patients with concomitant depressive symptoms, this convergence did not happen.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with migraine not only have higher CGRP levels compared with HCs, but also the presence of depressive symptoms seems to increase salivary CGRP levels and we have evidence, for the first time, that baseline salivary CGRP concentration is associated with treatment response to erenumab.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether adjunct alteplase improves brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 36 patients (mean [standard deviation] = 70.8 [13.5] years old, 18 [50%] women) with large vessel occlusion undergoing thrombectomy resulting in near-normal (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] b50/67/2c, n = 23, 64%) or normal angiographic reperfusion (eTICI 3, n = 13, 36%). Seventeen patients were randomized to intra-arterial alteplase (0.225mg/kg), and 19 received placebo. At 48 hours, patients had brain perfusion/diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of patients with areas of hypoperfusion on MRI. Secondary outcomes were the infarct expansion ratio (final to initial infarction volume), and the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak relative to total creatine as a marker of neuronal integrity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The prevalence of hypoperfusion was 24% with intra-arterial alteplase, and 58% with placebo (adjusted odds ratio = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04–0.91, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Among 14 patients with final eTICI 3 scores, hypoperfusion was found in 1 of 7 (14%) in the alteplase group and 3 of 7 (43%) in the placebo group. Abnormal brain perfusion was associated with worse functional outcome at day 90. Alteplase significantly reduced the infarct expansion ratio compared with placebo (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 0.7 [0.5–1.2] vs 3.2 [1.8–5.7], <i>p</i> = 0.01) and resulted in higher NAA peaks (median [IQR] = 1.13 [0.91–1.36] vs 1.00 [0.74–1.22], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a high prevalence of areas of hypoperfusion following thrombectomy despite successful reperfusion on angiography. Adjunct alteplase enhances brain reperfusion, which results in reduced expansion of the infarction and improved neuronal integrity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:860–870</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">5‐Year Associations among Cerebral Arterial Pulsatility, Perivascular Space Dilation, and White Matter Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High cerebral arterial pulsatility index (PI), white matter lesions (WMLs), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVSs), and lacunar infarcts are common findings in the elderly population, and considered indicators of small vessel disease (SVD). Here, we investigate the potential temporal ordering among these variables, with emphasis on determining whether high PI is an early or delayed manifestation of SVD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a population-based cohort, 4D flow MRI data for cerebral arterial pulsatility was collected for 159 participants at baseline (age 64–68), and for 122 participants at follow-up 5 years later. Structural MRI was used for WML and PVS segmentation, and lacune identification. Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were used to model longitudinal changes testing for pairwise associations, and latent change score (LCS) models to model multiple relationships among variables simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Longitudinal 5-year increases were found for WML, PVS, and PI. Cerebral arterial PI at baseline did not predict changes in WML or PVS volume. However, WML and PVS volume at baseline predicted 5-year increases in PI. This was shown for PI increases in relation to baseline WML and PVS volumes using LME models (R ≥ 0.24; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02 and R ≥ 0.23; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.03, respectively) and LCS models (β = 0.28; <i>p</i> = 0.015 and β = 0.28; <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). Lacunes at baseline were unrelated to PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In healthy older adults, indicators of SVD are related in a lead–lag fashion, in which the expression of WML and PVS precedes increases in cerebral arterial PI. Hence, we propose that elevated PI is a relatively late manifestation, rather than a risk factor, for cerebral SVD. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:871–881</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether  differential phosphorylation states of blood markers can identify patients with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed phospho(P)-Ser-935-LRRK2 and P-Ser-473-AKT levels in peripheral blood cells from patients with G2019S <i>LRRK2</i>-associated PD (L2PD, n = 31), G2019S <i>LRRK2</i> non-manifesting carriers (L2NMC, n = 26), idiopathic PD (iPD, n = 25), and controls (n = 40, total n = 122). We found no differences at P-Ser-935-LRRK2 between groups but detected a specific increase of P-Ser-473-AKT levels in all G2019S carriers, either L2PD or L2NMC, absent in iPD. Although insensitive to LRRK2 inhibition, our study identifies P-Ser-473-AKT as an endogenous candidate biomarker for peripheral inflammation in G2019S carriers using accessible blood cells.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite a 90% reperfusion rate, only 50% of patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion-related acute ischemic stroke (LVO-AIS) have a functional recovery at 3 months. Parenchymal hematoma (PH) is a predictor of poor outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT). We aim to investigate the relationship between the delay from onset to reperfusion, the occurrence of PH, and functional outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing prospective observational study. Data were analyzed from the subgroup of patients who underwent a successful EVT defined by a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score 2b-3. We assessed the factors associated with PH, (ie, PH1 or PH2 grade according to the European Collaborative Acute Stroke Study 2 (ECASS) classification of hemorrhagic transformation), then evaluated the relationships between PH, delay from onset to reperfusion, and functional recovery defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed 2,919 patients with an LVO-related AIS who underwent a successful EVT. Overall, 13.3% of the participant experienced a PH. The rate of PH increased by 2.5% (95% CI 1.5%–3.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) for every additional hour of onset to reperfusion delay and was, by comparison with the other study patients, consistently associated with a lower rate of functional recovery 19.7% (95% CI 11.6%–27.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) irrespective of time from onset to reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that PH rate is associated with the delay from onset to reperfusion and participates in the relationship between time to reperfusion and outcome. Time is Bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:882–887</p>

                <p>The first case of paralytic poliomyelitis in nearly a decade in the US was discovered in a 20-year-old unvaccinated man from Rockland County, New York, in July 2022, who developed acute flaccid myelitis. The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, derived from the oral polio vaccine. Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in local counties, as well as in New York City, representing community transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases, as well as the unique role neurologists might play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n = 52), solanezumab IV (n = 50), or placebo (n = 40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 9.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR = 5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i> = 0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR = 13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i> = 0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225 mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675 mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR &gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225 mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:729–744</p>

     alt="Mimicking partial to total placental insufficiency in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability <i>ex vivo</i> were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40 min (Full H-I). The new model, Partial+Full H-I, added a 30-min partial ischemia before the 40-min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C-section at E25 for <i>ex vivo</i> brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2 min of either H-I protocol. There was no difference between Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 6) showed less cell viability than Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 8) at 72-hr <i>ex vivo</i> in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H-I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H-I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.</p>

     alt="How lung injury and therapeutic oxygen could alter white matter development"/>
<p>Here we review the literature to shed light on the possibility that high oxygen levels and/or lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, can lead to neurodevelopmental impairment. The literature is especially convincing that these factors affect the neurodevelopment of extremely preterm or very low birth weight infants. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental brain injury describes a spectrum of neurological pathologies resulting from either antenatal or perinatal injury. This includes both cognitive and motor defects that affect patients for their entire lives. Developmental brain injury can be caused by a spectrum of conditions including stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage. Additional risk factors have been identified including very low birth weight, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supplementation. In fact, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an inflammatory disease associated with disrupted lung development, have been shown to have decreased cerebral white matter and decreased intracranial volumes. Thus, there appears to be a developmental link between the lung, O<sub>2</sub>, and the brain that leads to proper myelination. Here, we will discuss what is currently known about the link between O<sub>2</sub> and myelination and how scientists are exploring mechanisms through which supplemental O<sub>2</sub> and/or lung injury can affect brain development. Consideration of a link between the diseased lung and developing brain will allow clinicians to fine tune their approaches in managing preterm lung disease in order to optimize brain health.</p>

     alt="Neonatal administration of erythropoietin attenuates cognitive deficits in adult rats following placental insufficiency"/>
<p>In a transient systemic hypoxic-ischemic model of placental insufficiency, erythropoietin is found to have lasting, mitigating effects on the diminished cognitive flexibility and increased perseveration which are associated with encephalopathy of prematurity. Highly translatable testing, including novel object recognition and touchscreen-based visual discrimination and reversal learning, reveal significant differences post-treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Preterm birth is a principal cause of neurological disability later in life, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. Notably, cognitive impairment has greater impact on quality of life than physical disability. Survivors of preterm birth commonly have deficits of executive function. Difficulties with tasks and planning complexity correlate positively with increasing disability. To overcome these barriers for children born preterm, preclinical and clinical studies have emphasized the importance of neurorestoration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a endogenous cytokine with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action following perinatal brain injury. While most preclinical investigations have focused on pathology and molecular mechanisms, translational studies of repair using clinically viable biobehavioral biomarkers are still lacking. Here, using an established model of encephalopathy of prematurity secondary to placental insufficiency, we tested the hypothesis that administration of EPO in the neonatal period would attenuate deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in adult rats of both sexes. We assessed cognition and executive function in two ways. First, using the classic test of novel object recognition and second, using a touchscreen platform. Touchscreen testing allows for rigorous testing of cognition and executive function in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Data show that adult rats exhibit deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility following <i>in utero</i> placental insufficiency. Notably, neonatal treatment of EPO attenuates these deficits in adulthood and facilitates functional repair. Together, these data validate EPO neurorestoration using a clinically relevant outcome measure and support the concept that postnatal treatment following <i>in utero</i> injury can improve cognition and executive function through adulthood.</p>

<p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia-ischemia is labeled hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case–control studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by <i>a priori</i> criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel–Haenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal-population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron-specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.</p>

<p>Insomnia is prevalent in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and heavily influences quality of life. Using a mouse model of ASD we show that sleep problems are present from young ages and worsen with time, supporting abnormal sleep as a core feature of ASD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep problems are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can be observed before diagnosis, and are associated with increased restricted and repetitive behaviors. Therefore, sleep abnormalities may be a core feature of the disorder, but the developmental trajectory remains unknown. Animal models provide a unique opportunity to understand sleep ontogenesis in ASD. Previously we showed that adult mice with a truncation in the high-confidence ASD gene <i>Shank3</i> (Shank3<sup>∆C</sup>) recapitulate the clinical sleep phenotype. In this study we used longitudinal electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to define, for the first time, changes in sleep from weaning to young adulthood in an ASD mouse model. We show that Shank3<sup>∆C</sup> male mice sleep less overall throughout their lifespan, have increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in life despite significantly reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and have abnormal responses to increased sleep pressure that emerge during a specific developmental period. We demonstrate that the ability to fall asleep quickly in response to sleep loss develops normally between 24 and 30 days in mice. However, mutants are unable to reduce sleep latency after periods of prolonged waking and maintain the same response to sleep loss regardless of age. This phenomenon seems independent of homeostatic NREM sleep slow-wave dynamics. Overall, our study recapitulates both preclinical models and clinical studies showing that reduced sleep is consistently associated with ASD and suggests that problems falling asleep may reflect abnormal development of sleep and arousal mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is solid evidence for the prominent involvement of the central autonomic and default mode systems in shaping personality. However, whether functional connectivity of these systems can represent neural correlates and predictors of individual variation in personality traits is largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 215 healthy young adults were used to construct the sympathetic (SN), parasympathetic (PN), and default mode (DMN) networks, with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity measured. Personality factors were assessed using the five-factor model. We examined the associations between personality factors and functional network connectivity, followed by performance of personality prediction based on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. All personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) other than openness were significantly correlated with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity of the SN, PN, and DMN. Moreover, the CPM models successfully predicted conscientiousness and agreeableness at the individual level using functional network connectivity. Our findings may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural substrates underlying personality.</p>

     alt="IL-12p40 promotes secondary damage and functional impairment after spinal cord contusional injury"/>
<p>IL-12p40 is acutely upregulated, specifically on astrocytes in the ventro- and dorsomedial regions of the injured cords. IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are expressed early and chronically after SCI expanding from the ventromedial regions throughout the rest of the injured cord. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secondary damage obstructs functional recovery for individuals who have sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI). Two processes significantly contributing to tissue damage after trauma are spinal cord hemorrhage and inflammation: more specifically, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, frequently driven by pro-inflammatory factors. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators capable of modulating the immune response. While cytokines are necessary to elicit inflammation for proper healing, excessive inflammation can result in destructive processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are pathogenic in multiple autoimmune diseases. The cytokine subunit IL-12p40 is necessary to form bioactive IL-12 and IL-23. In this study, we examined the relationship between spinal cord hemorrhage and IL-12-related factors, as well as the impact of IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) on secondary damage and functional recovery after SCI. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and protein tissue analyses, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IL-12 and tissue hemorrhage. Receptor and ligand subunits of IL-12 were significantly upregulated after injury and colocalized with astrocytes, demonstrating a myriad of opportunities for IL-12 to induce an inflammatory response. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> female mice after SCI revealed an upregulation of genes associated with worsened recovery after SCI. Taken together, our data reveal a pathogenic role of IL-12p40 in the secondary damage after SCI, hindering functional recovery. IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) is thus an enticing neuroinflammatory target for further study as a potential therapeutic target to benefit recovery in acute SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Animal models of compression spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compression spinal cord injuries are a common cause of morbidity in people who experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Either as a by-product of a traumatic injury or due to nontraumatic conditions such as cervical myelitis, compression injuries are growing in prevalence clinically and many attempts of animal replication have been described within the literature. These models, however, often focus on the traumatic side of injury or mimic short-term injuries that are not representative of the majority of compression SCI. Of this, nontraumatic spinal cord injuries are severely understudied and have an increased prevalence in elderly populations, adults, and children. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate the current animal models of compression SCI and their suitability as a method for clinically relevant data that can help reduce morbidity and mortality of SCI. In this review, we reviewed the established and emerging methods of animal models of compression SCI. These models are the clip, balloon, solid spacer, expanding polymer, remote, weight drop, calibrated forceps, screw, and strap methods. These methods showed that there is a large reliance on the use of laminectomy to induce injury. Furthermore, the age range of many studies does not reflect the elderly and young populations that commonly suffer from compression injuries. It is therefore important to have techniques and methods that are able to minimize secondary effects of the surgeries, and are representative of the clinical cases seen so that treatments and interventions can be developed that are specific.</p>

                Traditionally, lymphocytic interferon γ (IFN-γ) was considered to be a simple 'booster' of proinflammatory responses by microglia (brain-resident macrophages) during bacterial or viral infection. Recent slice culture (in situ) and in vivo studies suggest, however, that IFN-γ has a unique role in microglial activation. Priming by IFN-γ results in proliferation (microgliosis), enhanced synapse elimination, and moderate nitric oxide release sufficient to impair synaptic transmission, gamma rhythm activity, and cognitive functions.

                Data on animals emphasize the importance of neuronal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) for feeding suppression, although it is unclear whether astrocytes participate in the transduction of anorectic GLP-1R-dependent signals. In humans, the brain circuitry underlying these effects remains insufficiently investigated. The present study aimed to explore GLP-1R protein expression in human hypothalamus and its correlation with body mass index (BMI). Sections of hypothalamus from 28 autopsy cases, 11 with normal weight (BMI<25 Kg/m2) and 17 with non-normal weight (BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2), were examined using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labeling. Prominent GLP-1R immunoexpression was detected in neurons of several hypothalamic nuclei, including paraventricular, supraoptic, and infundibular nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area (LH), and basal forebrain nuclei. Interestingly, in LH, GLP-1R was significantly decreased in individuals with BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2, compared with normal weight counterparts (p=0.03). Furthermore, GLP-1R was negatively correlated ({tau}b=-0.347, p=0.024) with BMI levels only in the LH. GLP-1R extensively colocalized with the anorexigenic and anti-obesogenic neuropeptide nucleobindin-2/nesfatin-1, but not with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. These data suggest a potential role for GLP-1R in the regulation of energy balance in human hypothalamus, possibly through interactions with nesfatin-1. In LH, an appetite- and reward-related brain region, reduced GLP-1R immunoexpression may contribute to dysregulation of homeostatic and/or hedonic feeding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain DNA methylomic analysis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration reveals OTUD4 and CEBPZ in shared dysregulated signatures across pathological subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is an umbrella term describing the neuropathology of a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes. The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD cohorts (228 individuals), generated using the Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify shared differential methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. Additionally, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits. Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data. The EWAS meta-analysis revealed four differentially methylated loci in FTLD, some of which showed altered gene and protein expression in FTLD. Two of the meta-analysis hits, OTUD4 and CEBPZ, were found to be co-methylated within signatures strongly associated with FTLD. These signatures were enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal birthdate reveals topography in a vestibular brainstem circuit for gaze stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Across the nervous system, neurons with similar attributes are topographically organized. This topography reflects developmental pressures. Oddly, vestibular (balance) nuclei are thought to be disorganized. By measuring activity in birthdated neurons, we revealed a functional map within the central vestibular projection nucleus that stabilizes gaze in the larval zebrafish. We first discovered that both somatic position and stimulus selectivity follow projection neuron birthdate. Next, with electron microscopy and loss-of-function assays, we found that patterns of peripheral innervation to projection neurons were similarly organized by birthdate. Lastly, birthdate revealed spatial patterns of axonal arborization and synapse formation to projection neuron outputs. Collectively, we find that development reveals previously hidden organization to the input, processing, and output layers of a highly-conserved vertebrate sensorimotor circuit. The spatial and temporal attributes we uncover constrain the developmental mechanisms that may specify the fate, function, and organization of vestibulo-ocular reflex neurons. More broadly, our data suggest that, like invertebrates, temporal mechanisms may assemble vertebrate sensorimotor architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clustering of CaV1.3 L-type calcium channels by Shank3</a></h4>

              
                Clustering of neuronal L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in the plasma membrane is increasingly implicated in creating highly localized Ca2+ signaling nanodomains. For example, LTCC activation can increase phosphorylation of the nuclear CREB transcription factor by increasing Ca2+ concentrations within a nanodomain close to the channel, without requiring bulk Ca2+ increases in the cytosol or nucleus. However, the molecular basis for LTCC clustering is poorly understood. The postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank3 specifically associates with one of the major neuronal LTCCs, the CaV1.3 calcium channel, and is required for optimal LTCC-dependent excitation-transcription coupling. Here, we co-expressed CaV1.3 1 subunits with two distinct epitope-tags with or without Shank3 in HEK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using the cell lysates revealed that Shank3 can assemble multiple CaV1.3 1 subunits in a complex under basal conditions. Moreover, CaV1.3 LTCC complex formation was facilitated by CaV{beta} subunits ({beta}3 and {beta}2a), which also interact with Shank3. Shank3 interactions with CaV1.3 LTCCs and multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly were disrupted following addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to cell lysates, perhaps simulating conditions within an activated CaV1.3 LTCC nanodomain. In intact HEK293T cells, co-expression of Shank3 enhanced the intensity of membrane-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters under basal conditions, but not after Ca2+ channel activation. Live cell imaging studies also revealed that Ca2+ influx through LTCCs disassociated Shank3 from CaV1.3 LTCCs clusters and reduced the CaV1.3 cluster intensity. Deletion of the PDZ domain from Shank3 prevented both binding to CaV1.3 and the changes in multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly in vitro and in HEK293 cells. Finally, we found that shRNA knock-down of Shank3 expression in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons reduced the intensity of surface-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters in dendrites. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism contributing to neuronal LTCC clustering under basal conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Model for Storing Memories in the Synaptic Structures of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is widely accepted as a mechanism through which the brain can learn information from different stimuli. Basing synaptic changes on the timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes enhances contributing edges within a network. While STDP rules control the evolution of networks, most research focuses on spiking rates or specific activation paths when evaluating learned information. However, since STDP augments structural weights, synapses may also contain embedded information. While imaging studies demonstrate physical changes to synapses due to STDP, these changes have not been interrogated based on their embedding capacity of a stimulus. Here, we show that networks with biological features and STDP rules can embed information on their stimulus into their synaptic weights. We use a k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the synaptic weights of thousands of independent networks to identify their stimulus with high accuracy based on local neighborhoods, demonstrating that the network structure can store stimulus information. While spike rates and timings remain useful, structural embeddings represent a new way to integrate information within a biological network. Our results demonstrate that there may be value in observing these changes directly. Beyond computational applications for monitoring these structural changes, this analysis may also inform investigation into neuroscience. Research is underway on the potential of astrocytes to integrate synapses in the brain and communicate that information elsewhere. In addition, observations of these synaptic embeddings may lead to novel therapies for memory disorders that are difficult to explain with current paradigms, such as transient epileptic amnesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomics reveals amygdala neuron regulation by fasting and ghrelin thereby promoting feeding</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) consists of numerous genetically-defined inhibitory neurons that control defensive and appetitive behaviors including feeding. Transcriptomic signatures of cell types and their links to function remain poorly understood. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we describe nine CeA cell clusters, of which four are mostly associated with appetitive and two with aversive behaviors. To analyze the activation mechanism of appetitive CeA neurons, we characterized Serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing neurons (CeAHtr2a) that comprise three appetitive clusters and were previously shown to promote feeding. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeAHtr2a neurons are activated by fasting, the hormone ghrelin, and the presence of food. Moreover, these neurons are required for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Appetitive CeA neurons responsive to fasting and ghrelin project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) causing inhibition of target PBN neurons. These results illustrate how the transcriptomic diversification of CeA neurons relates to fasting and hormone-regulated feeding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal mapping of cell types and projections in the central nucleus of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) is a brain region that integrates external and internal sensory information and executes innate and adaptive behaviors through distinct output pathways. Despite its complex functions, the diversity of molecularly defined neuronal types in the CEA and their contributions to major axonal projection targets have not been examined systematically. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to classify molecularly defined cell types in the CEA and identified marker-genes to map the location of these neuronal types using expansion assisted iterative fluorescence in situ hybridization (EASI-FISH). We developed new methods to integrate EASI-FISH with 5-plex retrograde axonal labeling to determine the spatial, morphological, and connectivity properties of ~30,000 molecularly defined CEA neurons. Our study revealed spatio-molecular organization of the CEA, with medial and lateral CEA associated with distinct cell families. We also found a long-range axon projection network from the CEA, where target regions receive inputs from multiple molecularly defined cell types. Axon collateralization was found primarily among projections to hindbrain targets, which are distinct from forebrain projections. This resource reports marker-gene combinations for molecularly defined cell types and axon-projection types, which will be useful for selective interrogation of these neuronal populations to study their contributions to the diverse functions of the CEA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive Network Analysis Identifies JMJD6 and Other Novel Key Drivers in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of genetic studies on late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease (AD) remain unclear. Furthermore, different cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) play distinct roles in the onset and progression of AD pathology. To better comprehend the complex etiology of AD, we used an integrative approach to build robust predictive (causal) network models which were cross-validated over multiple large human multi-omics datasets in AD. We employed a published method to delineate bulk-tissue gene expression into single cell-type gene expression and integrated clinical and pathologic traits of AD, single nucleotide variation, and deconvoluted gene expression for the construction of predictive network models for each cell type in AD. With these predictive causal models, we are able to identify and prioritize robust key drivers of the AD-associated network state. In this study, we focused on neuron-specific network models and prioritized 19 predicted key drivers modulating AD pathology. These targets were validated via shRNA knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons (iNs), in which 10 out of the 19 neuron-related targets (JMJD6, NSF, NUDT2, YWHAZ, RBM4, DCAF12, NDRG4, STXBP1, ATP1B1, and FIBP) significantly modulated levels of amyloid-beta and/or phosphorylated tau peptides in the postmitotic iNs. Most notably, knockdown of JMJD6 significantly altered the neurotoxic ratios of A{beta} to 40 and p231-tau to total tau, indicating its potential therapeutic relevance to both amyloid and tau pathology in AD. Molecular validation by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in iNs further confirmed the network structure, showing significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes after knockdown of the validated targets. Interestingly, our network model predicts that these 10 key drivers are upstream regulators of REST and VGF, two recently identified key regulators of AD pathogenesis.

                The foraging behavior of honeybees is one of the most systematically composed behaviors among social insects which are admirable to watch. The main purpose of honeybee foraging is to collect food for their colony and since ancient days honeybee products have been used for various medicinal purposes (Singh and Takhellambam 2021). During foraging, honeybees gather information and transmit to their colony members regarding the location, distance, and profitability of forage sites with the help of unique movements called waggle dance. The capacities of honeybees time memory enable the foragers to return to a good food source in anticipation of the time of day. This highly intellectual, dynamic, and well-coordinated behavior of honeybees makes them to be one of the best choices of behavioral model to study various aspects of dynamic behaviors. As a result, vast knowledge in honeybee behavior has been accumulated and several recent studies immerge towards finding the underpinning regulatory biology of honeybee foraging behaviors. Immediate early genes (IE) genes are well documented neural markers and their promising roles in honeybee foraging have been demonstrated. Two of our recent studies showed three IE genes Egr-1, Hr38 and Kakusei involvement during the daily foraging of honeybees. This finding has provided an avenue to further explore and identify the regulatory genes/proteins and neurons that underlie a specific behavior such as learning, memory, communication, and interaction etc. In this study we further analyze our previous published data to examine interaction of the three genes during the daily foraging of honeybees.

                Background: How we discuss older adults can influence our perceptions of aging and age-related policies, particularly during times of crisis. Ageist discourse in the media impacts how society views older adults and how older adults view themselves. Negative stereotypes have been associated with negative health outcomes and can exacerbate the adverse events faced by older adults during a pandemic. This study examined the Quebec media’s portrayal of older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes before and during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Quebec was on 27 February 2020. The Factiva database was searched for newspaper articles that were published three months before (pre) and three months after (peri) the first confirmed case. Articles had to include the terms: older adults, LTC, and/or residence. Articles were excluded if they did not discuss direct or indirect impacts in the lives of people living in LTC (i.e., only discussed statistics of COVID-19 cases). After screening, 208 articles were retained, and critical discourse analysis was conducted. Results: The media discourse regarding older adults in LTC homes revealed a lack of resources (i.e., insufficient staff) and negative health outcomes for older adults (i.e., bed sores) in both the pre- and peri-COVID-19 articles. Negative and positive elements emerged from the peri-COVID-19 discourse, including increased social isolation of those in LTC, government action and advocacy (by health care practitioners and family) to support those in LTC homes. Conclusions: Existing systemic problems were exacerbated by the pandemic and this impacted older adults in LTC homes negatively. Despite this, the peri-COVID-19 discourse suggests meaningful change at the societal and policy levels to improve outcomes for future generations of older adults who reside in LTC homes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian parameter estimation for dynamical models in systems biology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Linden, Boris Kramer, Padmini Rangamani</p>

Dynamical systems modeling, particularly via systems of ordinary differential equations, has been used to effectively capture the temporal behavior of different biochemical components in signal transduction networks. Despite the recent advances in experimental measurements, including sensor development and ‘-omics’ studies that have helped populate protein-protein interaction networks in great detail, modeling in systems biology lacks systematic methods to estimate kinetic parameters and quantify associated uncertainties. This is because of multiple reasons, including sparse and noisy experimental measurements, lack of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions, and missing biochemical interactions. Additionally, the inherent nonlinearities with respect to the states and parameters associated with the system of differential equations further compound the challenges of parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and complete quantification of the effects of uncertainties in the data and models. We apply these methods to a series of signaling models of increasing mathematical complexity. Systematic analysis of these dynamical systems showed that parameter estimation depends on data sparsity, noise level, and model structure, including the existence of multiple steady states. These results highlight how focused uncertainty quantification can enrich systems biology modeling and enable additional quantitative analyses for parameter estimation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic dynamics of Type-I interferon responses</a></h4>

Interferon (IFN) activates the transcription of several hundred of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that constitute a highly effective antiviral defense program. Cell-to-cell variability in the induction of ISGs is well documented, but its source and effects are not completely understood. The molecular mechanisms behind this heterogeneity have been related to randomness in molecular events taking place during the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Here, we study the sources of variability in the induction of the IFN-alpha response by using MxA and IFIT1 activation as read-out. To this end, we integrate time-resolved flow cytometry data and stochastic modeling of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The complexity of the IFN response was matched by fitting probability distributions to time-course flow cytometry snapshots. Both, experimental data and simulations confirmed that the MxA and IFIT1 induction circuits generate graded responses rather than all-or-none responses. Subsequently, we quantify the size of the intrinsic variability at different steps in the pathway. We found that stochastic effects are transiently strong during the ligand-receptor activation steps and the formation of the ISGF3 complex, but negligible for the final induction of the studied ISGs. We conclude that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a robust biological circuit that efficiently transmits information under stochastic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MetaLP: An integrative linear programming method for protein inference in metaproteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shichao Feng, Hong-Long Ji, Huan Wang, Bailu Zhang, Ryan Sterzenbach, Chongle Pan, Xuan Guo</p>

Metaproteomics based on high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) plays a crucial role in characterizing microbiome functions. The acquired MS/MS data is searched against a protein sequence database to identify peptides, which are then used to infer a list of proteins present in a metaproteome sample. While the problem of protein inference has been well-studied for proteomics of single organisms, it remains a major challenge for metaproteomics of complex microbial communities because of the large number of degenerate peptides shared among homologous proteins in different organisms. This challenge calls for improved discrimination of true protein identifications from false protein identifications given a set of unique and degenerate peptides identified in metaproteomics. MetaLP was developed here for protein inference in metaproteomics using an integrative linear programming method. Taxonomic abundance information extracted from metagenomics shotgun sequencing or 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, was incorporated as prior information in MetaLP. Benchmarking with mock, human gut, soil, and marine microbial communities demonstrated significantly higher numbers of protein identifications by MetaLP than ProteinLP, PeptideProphet, DeepPep, PIPQ, and Sipros Ensemble. In conclusion, MetaLP could substantially improve protein inference for complex metaproteomes by incorporating taxonomic abundance information in a linear programming model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comprehensive characterization of the Hsp70 interactome reveals novel client proteins and interactions mediated by posttranslational modifications</a></h4>

Hsp70 interactions are critical for cellular viability and the response to stress. Previous attempts to characterize Hsp70 interactions have been limited by their transient nature and the inability of current technologies to distinguish direct versus bridged interactions. We report the novel use of cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to comprehensively characterize the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (budding yeast) Hsp70 protein interactome. Using this approach, we have gained fundamental new insights into Hsp70 function, including definitive evidence of Hsp70 self-association as well as multipoint interaction with its client proteins. In addition to identifying a novel set of direct Hsp70 interactors that can be used to probe chaperone function in cells, we have also identified a suite of posttranslational modification (PTM)-associated Hsp70 interactions. The majority of these PTMs have not been previously reported and appear to be critical in the regulation of client protein function. These data indicate that one of the mechanisms by which PTMs contribute to protein function is by facilitating interaction with chaperones. Taken together, we propose that XL-MS analysis of chaperone complexes may be used as a unique way to identify biologically important PTMs on client proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The rearing environment persistently modulates mouse phenotypes from the molecular to the behavioural level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ivana Jaric, Bernhard Voelkl, Melanie Clerc, Marc W. Schmid, Janja Novak, Marianna Rosso, Reto Rufener, Vanessa Tabea von Kortzfleisch, S. Helene Richter, Manuela Buettner, André Bleich, Irmgard Amrein, David P. Wolfer, Chadi Touma, Shinichi Sunagawa, Hanno Würbel</p>

The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and thus argue that study designs should take environmental background into account to increase the robustness and replicability of findings.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear pore complex and functionally connects the nuclear basket with the nucleoskeleton in splants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Tang, Man Ip Ho, Byung-Ho Kang, Yangnan Gu</p>

The nuclear basket (NB) is an essential structure of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and serves as a dynamic and multifunctional platform that participates in various critical nuclear processes, including cargo transport, molecular docking, and gene expression regulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood, particularly in plants. Here, we identified a guanylate-binding protein (GBP)-like GTPase (GBPL3) as a novel NPC basket component in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Using fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we found that GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear rim and is enriched in the nuclear pore. Proximity labeling proteomics and protein-protein interaction assays revealed that GBPL3 is predominantly distributed at the NPC basket, where it physically associates with NB nucleoporins and recruits chromatin remodelers, transcription apparatus and regulators, and the RNA splicing and processing machinery, suggesting a conserved function of the NB in transcription regulation as reported in yeasts and animals. Moreover, we found that GBPL3 physically interacts with the nucleoskeleton via disordered coiled-coil regions. Simultaneous loss of <i>GBPL3</i> and 1 of the 4 <i>Arabidopsis</i> nucleoskeleton genes <i>CRWN</i>s led to distinct development- and stress-related phenotypes, ranging from seedling lethality to lesion development, and aberrant transcription of stress-related genes. Our results indicate that GBPL3 is a bona fide component of the plant NPC and physically and functionally connects the NB with the nucleoskeleton, which is required for the coordination of gene expression during plant development and stress responses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differences in temporal processing speeds between the right and left auditory cortex reflect the strength of recurrent synaptic connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Demetrios Neophytou, Diego M. Arribas, Tushar Arora, Robert B. Levy, Il Memming Park, Hysell V. Oviedo</p>

Brain asymmetry in the sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation is an established functional feature that underlies the perception of speech and music. The left auditory cortex (ACx) is believed to specialize in processing fast temporal components of speech sounds, and the right ACx slower components. However, the circuit features and neural computations behind these lateralized spectrotemporal processes are poorly understood. To answer these mechanistic questions, we use mice, an animal model that captures some relevant features of human communication systems. In this study, we screened for circuit features that could subserve temporal integration differences between the left and right ACx. We mapped excitatory input to principal neurons in all cortical layers and found significantly stronger recurrent connections in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left. We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a statistical method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation. Our study shows substantial evidence linking stronger recurrent synaptic connections to longer network timescales. These findings support speech processing theories that purport asymmetry in temporal integration is a crucial feature of lateralization in auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Plasmodium knowlesi infection in East Kalimantan, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth species of plasmodium infecting humans and the infection was first discovered in Southeast Asia in 2004. The incidence has been increasingly reported from almost all Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia. Although the global incidence of malaria has decreased around 50% in the last decade, the increase of knowlesi malaria infection which can cause severe malaria is of concern. During the period of 2018 to 2021, there were seven newfound cases of knowlesi malaria infection in patients treated at hospital in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of these patients are described here. All patients were male and worked in mining and palm oil plantations in the forest in several districts in East, North, and South Kalimantan. The diagnosis was based on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smear and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Antimalarial treatment was artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) / dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) fixed-dose combination via oral administration for three days with the doses were based on body weight. All knowlesi malaria patients in this report were presented as uncomplicated cases with great response to ACT after 2-3 days of administration without any adverse effects. Besides fever, gastrointestinal symptoms were major symptoms. Anemia was rare, leukocyte count was normal, however thrombocytopenia was found in all patients. P. knowlesi infection has been discovered in East Kalimantan Province and recently the incidence might be higher than the reported cases, making it resemble an iceberg phenomenon. Therefore, we should build awareness of the rapid increasing of knowlesi malaria cases and its prevention.

                Background: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) that affects millions of people. Children are the most vulnerable group to developing overt disease. An estimated 779 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis and 50 million preschool-age children (PSAC) need treatment. PSAC are not currently targeted by national chemotherapy campaigns due to a lack of suitable pediatric formulations of praziquantel. The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium has developed an orally dispersible praziquantel formulation (arpraziquantel) and is facilitating its adoption for schistosomiasis control by endemic countries through the ADOPT program – an implementation research program that paves the way for the large-scale delivery of the child-friendly formulation to treat schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children in endemic countries. A key challenge for comprehensive NTD control including schistosomiasis is reaching all at-risk populations, including those hard to reach. Main access barriers include geographic, social and economic conditions. Objective: This scoping literature review aims to document the epidemiology of schistosomiasis in children under 6 years of age living in hard-to-reach areas and populations. Methods: This review will adopt the five-stage scoping review process of identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting data and collating, summarizing and reporting results. Electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), LILACS and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) will be searched for relevant articles. Two independent reviewers will screen identified articles using a two-stage approach of reviewing the title/abstract and then the full text of provisionally retained articles. Relevant literatures will be downloaded into EndNote X9 to maintain and manage citation and facilitate the overall review process. A meta-analysis will be conducted if indicated. Relevance: The results will provide insights into the burden of schistosomiasis among marginalized PSAC, aiming to produce evidence on the need for inclusion of this population when designing the expansion of preventive chemotherapy programs.

                The dorsal striatum integrates prior and current information to guide appropriate decision-making. Chronic stress and stimulant exposure interferes with decision-making, and can confer similar cognitive and behavioral inflexibilities. This review examines the literature on acute and chronic regulation of the epigenome by stress and stimulants. Recent evidence suggests that exposures to stress and stimulants share similarities in the manners in which they regulate the dorsal striatum epigenome through DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications.

                The correlation coefficient gauges linear association between two variables. However, interpreting its value depends on the question at hand. This article argues that relying on the correlation coefficient may be irrelevant for many neuroscience research tasks. When the experimental dataset is contextually suitable for binning-averaging, other indicators of statistical association could prove more suitable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">COVID-19 cluster size and transmission rates in schools from crowdsourced case reports</a></h4>

              
                The role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is controversial, with some claiming they are an important driver of the pandemic and others arguing that transmission in schools is negligible. School cluster reports that have been collected in various jurisdictions are a source of data about transmission in schools. These reports consist of the name of a school, a date, and the number of students known to be infected. We provide a simple model for the frequency and size of clusters in this data, based on random arrivals of index cases at schools who then infect their classmates with a highly variable rate, fitting the overdispersion evident in the data. We fit our model to reports from four Canadian provinces, providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size, as well as the distribution of the instantaneous transmission parameter β, whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment. According to our model with parameters estimated from the data, in all four provinces i) more than 65% of non-index cases occur in the 20% largest clusters, and ii) reducing instantaneous transmission rate and the number of contacts a student has at any given time are effective in reducing the total number of cases, whereas strict bubbling (keeping contacts consistent over time) does not contribute much to reduce cluster sizes. We predict strict bubbling to be more valuable in scenarios with substantially higher transmission rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Landscape of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity as an emergent property of coordinated teams in regulatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Elucidating the design principles of regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making has fundamental implications in mapping and eventually controlling cell-fate decisions. Despite being complex, these regulatory networks often only give rise to a few phenotypes. Previously, we identified two 'teams' of nodes in a small cell lung cancer regulatory network that constrained the phenotypic repertoire and aligned strongly with the dominant phenotypes obtained from network simulations (Chauhan et al., 2021). However, it remained elusive whether these 'teams' exist in other networks, and how do they shape the phenotypic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that five different networks of varying sizes governing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity comprised of two 'teams' of players - one comprised of canonical drivers of epithelial phenotype and the other containing the mesenchymal inducers. These 'teams' are specific to the topology of these regulatory networks and orchestrate a bimodal phenotypic landscape with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes being more frequent and dynamically robust to perturbations, relative to the intermediary/hybrid epithelial/ mesenchymal ones. Our analysis reveals that network topology alone can contain information about corresponding phenotypic distributions, thus obviating the need to simulate them. We propose 'teams' of nodes as a network design principle that can drive cell-fate canalization in diverse decision-making processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Augmin prevents merotelic attachments by promoting proper arrangement of bridging and kinetochore fibers</a></h4>

              
                The human mitotic spindle is made of microtubules nucleated at centrosomes, at kinetochores, and from pre-existing microtubules by the augmin complex. However, it is unknown how the augmin-mediated nucleation affects distinct microtubule classes and thereby mitotic fidelity. Here we use superresolution microscopy to analyze the previously indistinguishable microtubule arrangements within the crowded metaphase plate area and demonstrate that augmin is vital for the formation of uniformly arranged parallel units consisting of sister kinetochore fibers connected by a bridging fiber. This ordered geometry helps both prevent and resolve merotelic attachments. Whereas augmin-nucleated bridging fibers prevent merotelic attachments by creating a nearly parallel and highly bundled microtubule arrangement unfavorable for creating additional attachments, augmin-nucleated k-fibers produce robust force required to resolve errors during anaphase. STED microscopy revealed that bridging fibers were impaired twice as much as k-fibers following augmin depletion. The complete absence of bridging fibers from a significant portion of kinetochore pairs, especially in the inner part of the spindle, resulted in the specific reduction of the interkinetochore distance. Taken together, we propose a model where augmin promotes mitotic fidelity by generating assemblies consisting of bridging and kinetochore fibers that align sister kinetochores to face opposite poles, thereby preventing erroneous attachments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vinculin recruitment to α-catenin halts the differentiation and maturation of enterocyte progenitors to maintain homeostasis of the Drosophila intestine</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms communicating changes in tissue stiffness and size are particularly relevant in the intestine because it is subject to constant mechanical stresses caused by peristalsis of its variable content. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal epithelium, we investigate the role of vinculin, one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, which functions in both cadherin and integrin adhesion complexes. We discovered that vinculin regulates cell fate decisions, by preventing precocious activation and differentiation of intestinal progenitors into absorptive cells. It achieves this in concert with α-catenin at sites of cadherin adhesion, rather than as part of integrin function. Following asymmetric division of the stem cell into a stem cell and an enteroblast (EB), the two cells initially remain connected by adherens junctions, where vinculin is required, only on the EB side, to maintain the EB in a quiescent state and inhibit further divisions of the stem cell. By manipulating cell tension, we show that vinculin recruitment to adherens junction regulates EB activation and numbers. Consequently, removing vinculin results in an enlarged gut with improved resistance to starvation. Thus, mechanical regulation at the contact between stem cells and their progeny is used to control tissue cell number.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tug of war between filament treadmilling and myosin induced contractility generates actin ring</a></h4>

              
                In most eukaryotic cells, actin filaments assemble into a shell-like actin cortex under the plasma membrane, controlling cellular morphology, mechanics, and signaling. The actin cortex is highly polymorphic, adopting diverse forms such as the ring-like structures found in podosomes, axonal rings, and immune synapses. The biophysical principles that underlie the formation of actin rings and cortices remain unknown. Using a molecular simulation platform, called MEDYAN, we discovered that varying the filament treadmilling rate and myosin concentration induces a finite size phase transition in actomyosin network structures. We found that actomyosin networks condense into clusters at low treadmilling rates or high myosin concentration but form ring-like or cortex-like structures at high treadmilling rates and low myosin concentration. This mechanism is supported by our corroborating experiments on live T cells, which exhibit ring-like actin networks upon activation by stimulatory antibody. Upon disruption of filament treadmilling or enhancement of myosin activity, the pre-existing actin rings are disrupted into actin clusters or collapse towards the network center respectively. Our analyses suggest that the ring-like actin structure is a preferred state of low mechanical energy, which is, importantly, only reachable at sufficiently high treadmilling rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An inhibitory circuit from central amygdala to zona incerta drives pain-related behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Central amygdala neurons expressing protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ) are sensitized following nerve injury and promote pain-related responses in mice. The neural circuits underlying modulation of pain-related behaviors by CeA-PKCδ neurons, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified a neural circuit that originates in CeA-PKCδ neurons and terminates in the ventral region of the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic structure previously linked to pain processing. Behavioral experiments show that chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic ZI neurons induced bilateral hypersensitivity in uninjured mice and contralateral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of GABAergic ZI neurons reversed nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Optogenetic manipulations of CeA-PKCδ axonal terminals in the ZI further showed that inhibition of this pathway reduces nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity whereas activation of the pathway produces hypersensitivity in the uninjured paws. Altogether, our results identify a novel nociceptive inhibitory efferent pathway from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI that bidirectionally modulates pain-related behaviors in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KAT2-mediated acetylation switches the mode of PALB2 chromatin association to safeguard genome integrity</a></h4>

              
                The tumour suppressor PALB2 stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA damage, whilst its steady-state association with active genes protects these loci from replication stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A and 2B (KAT2A/2B, also called GCN5/PCAF), two well-known transcriptional regulators, acetylate a cluster of seven lysine residues (7K-patch) within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM) and, in this way, regulate context-dependent PALB2 binding to chromatin. In unperturbed cells, the 7K-patch is targeted for KAT2A/2B-mediated acetylation, which in turn enhances the direct association of PALB2 with nucleosomes. Importantly, DNA damage triggers a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and increases the overall mobility of PALB2. Distinct missense mutations of the 7K-patch render the mode of PALB2 chromatin binding, making it either unstably chromatin-bound (7Q) or randomly bound with a reduced capacity for mobilisation (7R). Significantly, both of these mutations confer a deficiency in RAD51 foci formation and increase DNA damage in S phase, leading to the reduction of overall cell survival. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation of the ChAM 7K-patch acts as a molecular switch to enable dynamic PALB2 shuttling for HR repair while protecting active genes during DNA replication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facilitatory stimulation of the pre-SMA in healthy aging has distinct effects on task-based activity and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Semantic cognition is central to communication and our understanding of the world. It is usually well preserved in healthy aging. However, semantic control processes, which guide semantic access and retrieval, decline with age. The present study explored the potential of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to enhance semantic cognition in healthy middle-aged to older adults. Using an individualized stimulation approach, we applied iTBS to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and assessed task-specific effects on semantic judgments in functional neuroimaging. We found increased activation after effective relative to sham stimulation only for the semantic task in visual and dorsal attention networks. Further, iTBS increased functional connectivity in domain-general executive networks. Notably, stimulation-induced changes in activation and connectivity related differently to behavior: While increased activation of the parietal dorsal attention network was linked to poorer semantic performance, its enhanced coupling with the pre-SMA was associated with more efficient semantic processing. Our findings indicate differential effects of iTBS on activity and connectivity. We show that iTBS modulates networks in a task-dependent manner and generates remote network effects. Stimulating the pre-SMA was linked to more efficient but not better performance, indicating a role in domain-general semantic control processes distinct to domain-specific semantic control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parsing brain-behavior heterogeneity in very preterm born children using integrated similarity networks</a></h4>

              
                Very preterm birth (VPT; [&le;] 32 weeks gestation) is associated with altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan. However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females) previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results showed two- and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised a "resilient" subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function and socio-emotional outcomes) and an "at-risk" subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive outcomes). The three-cluster solution showed an additional third "intermediate" subgroup displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the resilient and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively stimulating home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal clinical risk, while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical but the highest socio-demographic risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient subgroup displayed larger neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread white matter microstructural alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification following VPT birth is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized interventions aimed at promoting children's resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Action, attention, and temporal binding</a></h4>

              
                Outcome binding has long been understood as an illusion of timing perception, in which an action-effect is perceived as occurring earlier than it actually does. This illusion has been heavily investigated over the past two decades with regards to the mechanisms behind and potential applications. Here we present evidence in favour of understanding outcome binding as a spatial attentional effect, at least in part. In a series of 3 experiments, it was shown that an action-effect was preceded by a predictive attention shift in the classic Libet clock paradigm. The magnitude of attention shift predicted the size of outcome binding. When the attention shift was controlled for, binding also disappeared. Our study also calls for a reassessment of results obtained from the clock-like method in mental chronometry dating back to Wundt, as attention may well be a critical confounding factor in the interpretation of the results from these studies.

                The formation of long-term memories requires changes in the transcriptional program and de novo protein synthesis. One of the critical regulators for long-term memory (LTM) formation and maintenance is the transcription factor CREB. Genetic studies have dissected the requirement of CREB activity within memory circuits, however less is known about the genetic mechanisms acting downstream of CREB and how they may contribute defining LTM phases. To better understand the downstream mechanisms, we here used a targeted DamID approach (TaDa). We generated a CREB-Dam fusion protein using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as model. Expressing CREB-Dam in the mushroom bodies (MBs), a brain center implicated in olfactory memory formation, we identified genes that are differentially expressed between paired and unpaired appetitive training paradigm. Of those genes we selected candidates for an RNAi screen in which we identified genes causing increased or decreased LTM.

                Appropriate modulation of escape behaviors in response to potentially damaging stimuli is essential for survival. Although nociceptive circuitry has been studied, it is poorly understood how genetic contexts affect the relevant escape responses. Using an unbiased genome-wide association analysis, we identified a Ly6/-neurotoxin family protein, Belly roll (Bero), which negatively regulates Drosophila nociceptive escape behavior. We show that Bero is expressed in abdominal leucokinin-producing neurons (ABLK neurons) and bero knockdown in ABLK neurons resulted in enhanced escape behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ABLK neurons responded to the activation of nociceptors and initiated the behavior. Notably, bero knockdown reduced the persistent neuronal activity and increased the evoked nociceptive responses in ABLK neurons. Our findings reveal that Bero modulates an escape response by regulating distinct neuronal activities in ABLK neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Converging pathways direct synapse elimination through the homeodomain transcriptional regulator DVE-1</a></h4>

              
                An important step in brain development is the remodeling of juvenile neural circuits to establish mature connectivity. The elimination of juvenile synapses is a critical step in this process; however, the molecular mechanisms directing synapse elimination processes and their timing are not fully understood. We identify here a conserved transcriptional regulator, DVE-1, that directs the elimination of juvenile synaptic inputs onto remodeling C. elegans GABAergic neurons. Dorsally localized juvenile acetylcholine receptor clusters and apposing presynaptic sites are eliminated during maturation of wild type GABAergic neurons but persist into adulthood in dve-1 mutants. The persistence of juvenile synapses in dve-1 mutants does not impede synaptic growth during GABAergic remodeling and therefore results in heightened motor connectivity, producing a turning bias during movement. DVE-1 is localized to GABAergic nuclei prior to remodeling and DVE-1 nuclear localization is required for synapse elimination to proceed. Synaptic remodeling is antagonized by the expression of the Ig domain protein OIG-1. Premature synapse elimination in oig-1 mutants is reversed by dve-1 mutation, while precocious synaptic growth is unaffected, indicating a functional separation of synapse destruction and growth during remodeling. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel strategy for sculpting mature connectivity through the coordination of parallel DVE-1-regulated pro-degenerative processes and temporally regulated maintenance mechanisms.

                Spatial memory requires an intact hippocampus. Hippocampal function during epochs of locomotion and quiet rest (e.g., grooming and reward consumption) have been the target of extensive study. However, during navigation rats frequently rear up on to their hind legs and the importance of hippocampal activity during these periods of attentive sampling for spatial memory is unknown. To address this, we tested the necessity of dorsal hippocampal activity during rearing epochs in the study phase of a delayed win-shift task for memory performance in the subsequent test phase. Hippocampal activity was manipulated with closed-loop, bilateral, optogenetic inactivation. Spatial memory accuracy was significantly and selectively reduced when the dorsal hippocampus was inactivated during rearing epochs at encoding. These data show that hippocampal activity during periods of rearing can be important for spatial memory, revealing a novel link between hippocampal function during epochs of rearing and spatial memory.

                Conductance-based models have played an important role in the development of modern neuroscience. These mathematical models are powerful 'tools' that enable theoretical explorations in experimentally untenable situations, and can lead to the development of novel hypotheses and predictions. With advances in cell imaging and computational power, multi-compartment models with morphological accuracy are becoming common practice. However, as more biological details are added, they make extensive explorations and analyses more challenging largely due to their huge computational expense. Here, we focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cell models. OLM cells can contribute to functionally relevant theta rhythms in the hippocampus by virtue of their ability to express spiking resonance at theta frequencies, but what characteristics underlie this is far from clear. We converted a previously developed detailed multi-compartment OLM cell model into a reduced single compartment model that retained biophysical fidelity with its underlying ion currents. We showed that the reduced OLM cell model can capture complex output that includes spiking resonance in in vivo-like scenarios as previously obtained with the multi-compartment model. Using the reduced model, we were able to greatly expand our in vivo-like scenarios. Applying spike-triggered average analyses, we were thus able to to determine that it is a combination of hyperpolarization-activated cation and muscarinic type potassium currents that specifically allow OLM cells to exhibit spiking resonance at theta frequencies. Further, we developed a robust Kalman Filtering (KF) method to estimate parameters of the reduced model in real-time. We showed that it may be possible to directly estimate conductance parameters from experiments since this KF method can reliably extract parameter values from model voltage recordings. Overall, our work showcases how the contribution of cellular biophysical current details could be determined and assessed for spiking resonance. As well, our work shows that it may be possible to directly extract these parameters from current clamp voltage recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inherent envelope fluctuations in forward masking: Effects of age and hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Forward masking is generally greater for Gaussian noise (GN) than for low-fluctuation noise (LFN) maskers for listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Because older age and SNHL may affect recovery from masker envelope fluctuations differently, the current study explored which of these two factors contributed more substantially to the persistence of GN disruption. GN disruption was measured using three masker-signal delays (25, 75, and 150 ms) for three adult participant groups: younger listeners with normal hearing (YNH), older participants with normal, or near-normal, hearing (ONH), and older participants with sensorineural hearing loss (OSNHL). The role of underlying mechanisms was tested using a computational model for midbrain neurons. The primary result suggests that older listeners with normal or near normal hearing may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of masker-envelope fluctuations than younger listeners with normal hearing. Results from the computational model propose that there may be a larger influence of efferent feedback and saturation of inner hair cells on GN disruption than previously expected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The line bisection bias stems from left-side underawareness, not from right-side hyperattention</a></h4>

              
                It is still a matter of scientific debate whether the line bisection bias frequently observed in patients with spatial neglect is due to attentional underawareness of the left end of the line, attentional hyperattention towards the right end, or a logarithmically compressed perception of the line. To address this question, neglect patients who showed a line bisection bias were administered additional tasks involving horizontal lines (e.g., number line estimation tasks). Their performance was compared to neglect patients not showing a line bisection bias, patients with right hemisphere damage without neglect, and healthy controls. Results indicated that patients with a line bisection bias tended to overestimate lefthand segments when they had to dissect lines into three or four equal parts. This is congruent with both the notions of an underawareness of lefthand segments as well as a logarithmic compression of the line. However, when these patients had to imagine the lines as bounded fraction number lines ranging from 0-1, the results were mixed. When the number lines ranged from 0-10, these patients showed rightward overestimation biases for the numbers 4 and 5. Additionally, all patient groups, but not healthy controls, tended to place number 1 too far to the left and number 9 too far to the right, suggesting a general bias towards endpoints. In sum, this seems more congruent with attentional accounts than a perceptual one. Spatial-numerical associations could be ruled out, as all participants showed a verbal number bisection bias towards smaller numbers (i.e., the "left" of the mental number line). Therefore, these findings seem to indicate that the line bisection bias is most likely due to underawareness of the left end rather than hyperattention towards the right or a logarithmic perception of the line.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel method for measuring the priming effect of rewarding brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. Previous research on the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation utilized a runway paradigm in which running speed serves as the measure of motivation. One goal of the present study was to develop a method for measuring the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation in conventional operant-conditioning chambers. The speed with which a two-lever response chain was executed serves as the measure of motivation. Using this new paradigm, we document how the priming effect depends on both the strength and cost of the reward. In a second experiment, we assessed a modification of the new method that entails self-administered priming stimulation and alternating blocks of primed and unprimed trials. Reliable, consistent priming effects of substantial magnitude were obtained in the modified paradigm, which is closely analogous to the runway paradigm. The modified paradigm can be readily implemented in the standard operant-conditioning chambers available in most behavioral neuroscience laboratories.

                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the de facto clinical side effect that limits the administration of anti-cancer treatments. Recently, we reported that intrathecally injected bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reduced nerve trauma-induced neuropathic pain in male mice via TGF-{beta}1 signaling. In this study, we examined sex-dependent pain relief mediated by intrathecally delivered BMSCs and TGF-{beta}1 in paclitaxel (PTX)-induced CIPN. BMSCs were prepared from primary cultures of male or female mice separately. A single intrathecal injection of BMSCs, prepared from male donors, completely prevented the development of PTX-evoked mechanical allodynia in male mice. However, female mice showed no analgesic response to either male or female BMSCs. Additionally, male mice did not demonstrate an analgesic response to BMSCs from female donors. Intrathecal injection of TGF-{beta}1 neutralizing antibody reversed the analgesic action of BMSCs. Interestingly, spinal administration of TGF-{beta}1 reduced mechanical allodynia in male mice but not in female mice. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in spinal cord slices revealed that TGF-{beta}1 inhibited PTX-induced synaptic plasticity, i.e. increase in spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPsCs), in spinal cord neurons from male mice only. Intrathecal TGF-{beta}1 increased the paw withdrawal threshold in von Frey testing in naive mice of males but not females, and the antinociceptive effect of TGF-{beta}1 in males was blocked by orchiectomy-induced androgen deficiency. Together, these findings reveal sex dimorphism in BMSC control of mechanical pain through spinal TGF-{beta}1 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal gamma oscillations form complex ensembles modulated by behavior and learning</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex display a rich oscillatory activity, believed to support neural information processing in key cognitive functions. In the hippocampal region CA1, a slow gamma rhythm (30-80 Hz) generated in CA3 would support memory retrieval whereas a medium gamma rhythm (60-120 Hz) generated in the entorhinal cortex would support memory encoding. However, descriptions involving discrete gamma sub-bands can only partially account for the haphazard diversity of oscillatory behaviors observed in individual recordings during spatial navigation behavior. Here, we stress that transient gamma oscillatory episodes at any frequency or phase relative to the ongoing theta (4-12 Hz) rhythm can be recorded at any layer within CA1. Eventually, the commonly reported averages are dominated by a minority of very strong power events overshadowing gamma heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we show that such gamma diversity can be naturally explained by a simple mechanistic model, and that behavior-related information (position within a maze) can be decoded from most individual gamma events, despite their low power and erratic-like nature. Our results indicate that behavior specifically shapes ensembles of irregular hippocampal gamma oscillations, in a way which evolves with learning, depends on the hippocampal layer and is hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of rigid, narrowly tuned gamma sub-bands. Beyond randomness, the pervasive gamma diversity may thus reflect complexity at the "fringe-of-synchrony" likely functional but invisible to classic average-based analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturally occurring Alzheimer's disease in rhesus monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. To date, its cause is unclear and there are no effective treatments or preventive measures. Despite there are accumulating evidences for the existence of AD pathological hallmarks in the brain of aging rhesus monkeys, it remains a mainstream notion that monkeys do not develop AD naturally. This is an important issue because it will determine how we use monkeys in AD studies. To settle down this issue, a group (n=10) of aged rhesus monkeys 26 years old or above went through a systematic AD screening procedure in this study. Three of these monkeys showed severe memory impairments (SMI) after evaluated with a classic working memory test. Further behavioral testing revealed that the SMI monkeys also exhibited apathy-like behavior, which is another core AD clinical symptom. In addition to the cognitive deficits, two of the three SMI monkeys developed all of the three AD pathological hallmarks, including neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques and neuronal loss. According to the diagnostic criteria of human AD, the two SMI monkeys were clearly naturally occurring AD monkeys. These results suggest that AD is not a uniquely human disease and monkeys have great potential for the development of much needed etiological AD models, which are vital for better understanding of developmental process of AD and the base of identification of early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets of AD.

                Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that codes for the protein huntingtin (HTT or Htt in mice). HTT is a multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for embryonic survival, normal neurodevelopment, and adult brain function. The ability of wild-type HTT to protect neurons against various forms of death raises the possibility that loss of normal HTT function may worsen disease progression in HD. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials for HD, but concerns have been raised that decreasing wild-type HTT levels may have adverse effects. Here we show that Htt levels modulate the occurrence of an idiopathic seizure disorder that spontaneously occurs in FVB/N mice. These abnormal FVB/N mice demonstrate various cardinal features of mouse models of epilepsy including spontaneous seizures, astrocytosis, neuronal hypertrophy, upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sudden seizure-related death. Interestingly, decreasing wild-type Htt levels increased the frequency of this disorder, while over-expression of HTT completely prevented it. Examination of the mechanism underlying huntingtin's ability to modulate the frequency of this seizure disorder indicated that over-expression of full length HTT can promote neuronal survival following seizures. Overall, our results demonstrate a protective role for huntingtin in this form of epilepsy and provide a plausible explanation for the observation of seizures in the juvenile form of HD, Lopes-Maciel-Rodan syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Adverse effects caused by altering huntingtin levels has ramifications related to Huntingtin-lowering therapies in development to treat HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Training stochastic stabilized supralinear networks by dynamics-neutral growth</a></h4>

              
                There continues to be a trade-off between the biological realism and performance of neural networks. Contemporary deep learning techniques allow neural networks to be trained to perform challenging computations at (near) human-level, but these networks typically violate key biological constraints. More detailed models of biological neural networks can incorporate many of these constraints but typically suffer from subpar performance and trainability. Here, we narrow this gap by developing an effective method for training a canonical model of cortical neural circuits, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), that in previous work had to be constructed manually or trained with undue constraints. SSNs are particularly challenging to train for the same reasons that make them biologically realistic: they are characterized by strongly-connected excitatory cells and expansive firing rate non-linearities that together make them prone to dynamical instabilities unless stabilized by appropriately tuned recurrent inhibition. Our method avoids such instabilities by initializing a small network and gradually increasing network size via the dynamics-neutral addition of neurons during training. We first show how SSNs can be trained to perform typical machine learning tasks by training an SSN on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by training an SSN on the challenging task of performing amortized Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference under a Gaussian scale mixture generative model of natural image patches with a rich and diverse set of basis functions - something that was not possible with previous methods. These results open the way to training realistic cortical-like neural networks on challenging tasks at scale.

                Associative memory is the ability to encode and retrieve relations between different stimuli. To better understand its neural basis, we investigated whether associative memory involves precisely timed spiking of neurons in the medial temporal lobes that exhibit stimulus-specific tuning. Using single-neuron recordings from epilepsy patients performing an associative object-location memory task, we identified the object- and place-specific neurons that encoded the separate elements of each memory. When patients encoded and retrieved particular memories, the relevant object- and place-specific neurons activated synchronously during hippocampal ripples. This ripple-locked coactivity of stimulus-specific neurons emerged over time as the patients associative learning progressed. Our results suggest a cellular account of associative memory, in which hippocampal ripples coordinate the activity of specialized cellular populations to facilitate links between stimuli.

                Mated females reallocate resources to offspring production, causing changes in nutritional requirements and challenges to energy homeostasis. Although observed in most species, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate the nutritional needs of mated females are not well understood. Here, we investigate the neural circuitry that regulates sugar appetite in mated Drosophila melanogaster females. During copulation, a male-derived sex peptide is transferred to females, silencing the mating status circuit to elicit many postmating behavioral changes1-3. We find that increased sucrose consumption is a postmated female behavior and show that it is mediated by the mating status circuit. We discovered that sexually dimorphic insulin receptor (Lgr3) neurons integrate mating status and nutritional state signals to adjust sucrose consumption. Lgr3+ cells receive inhibitory input from the mating status circuit via female specific pdC2 neurons. In mated females, the inhibition of Lgr3 cells from pdC2 is attenuated, transforming the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal that promotes sugar intake. Our results thus demonstrate that the mating circuit alters nutrient sensing centers in females to promote sugar consumption, providing a mechanism to increase intake in anticipation of the energetic costs associated with reproduction.

                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hours prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally and neurally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

                Neuropathic pain is a common health problem, resulting in exacerbated response to noxious and non noxious stimuli, as well as impaired emotional and cognitive responses. Unfortunately, neuropathic pain is also one of the most difficult pain syndromes to manage, highlighting the importance of better understanding of the brain regions and neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in its regulation. Among the many interconnected brain areas which process pain, the amygdala is known to play an important role in the integration of sensory and emotional pain signals. Here, we questioned the ability of a recently identified neuromodulatory mechanisms associated to the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGlu4 in the amygdala to modulate neuropathic pain. In a murine model of peripheral mononeuropathy induced by a chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve, we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of amygdala mGlu4 receptors efficiently alleviates sensory and depressive-like symptoms in both male and female mice. Moreover, we reveal a differential modulation of those symptoms, activating mGlu4 receptors in the controlateral amygdala, relatively to the side of the mononeuropathy, is necessary and sufficient to relieve both sensory and depressive-like symptoms while ipsilateral activation solely reduces depressive-like symptoms. Furthermore, using photopharmacology, a recent strategy allowing a precise spatiotemporal photocontrol of deep brain endogenous targets, we further demonstrate the rapid and reversible action of mGlu4-mediated neuromodulation on neuropathic pain symptoms. Finally, coupling photopharmacology and analgesic conditioned place preference, we show an important pain-reducing effect of mGlu4 activation. Taken together, these data highlight the analgesic potential of enhancing amygdala mGlu4 activity to counteract neuropathy in the hope of improving existing treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vutiglabridin improves neurodegeneration in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by targeting mitochondrial paraoxonase-2</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, share pathogenic features with obesity, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress. However, no drug targeting PON2 has ever been developed for the treatment of PD. Here, we show that vutiglabridin, a clinical phase 2-stage drug for the treatment of obesity, has therapeutic effects in PD models, targeting mitochondrial PON2. Vutiglabridin penetrates into the brain, binds to PON2, and restores 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of PON2 by lentiviral shRNA infection abolished the effects of vutiglabridin on mitochondria. In mice, vutiglabridin significantly alleviated motor impairments and damage to dopaminergic neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model, and these effects were also abolished in PON2-knockdown mice, suggesting that vutiglabridin is neuroprotective via PON2. Extensive in vitro and in vivo assessment of potential neurotoxicity showed vutiglabridin to be safe. Overall, these findings provide support for the clinical development of vutiglabridin as a novel PON2 modulator for the treatment of PD.

                Cell-specific pharmaceutical technologies promise mechanistic insight into clinical drugs[-]those that treat, and often define, human disease. In particular, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering) achieves genetically programmable control of drug concentration over cellular dimensions. The method is compatible with clinical pharmaceuticals and amenable to studies in behaving animals. Here, we describe DART.2, comprising three advances. First, we improve the efficiency of chemical capture, enabling cell-specific accumulation of drug to ~3,000-times the ambient concentration in 15 min. Second, we develop tracer reagents, providing a behavior- independent measure of cellular target engagement in each animal. Third, we extend the method to positive allosteric modulators and outline design principles for this clinically significant class. We showcase the platform with four pharmaceuticals[-]two that weaken excitatory (AMPAR) or inhibitory (GABAAR) chemical neurotransmission, and two that strengthen these forms of synaptic communication. Across four labs, we tested reagents in the mouse cerebellum, basal ganglia, visual cortex, and retina. Collectively, we demonstrate robust, bidirectional editing of chemical neurotransmission. We provide for distribution of validated reagents, community design principles, and synthetic building blocks for application to diverse pharmaceuticals.

                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. A previous study demonstrated that the priming effect of rewarding medial forebrain bundle stimulation was remarkably resilient following administration of medium-high doses of pimozide. Here, we used the operant-chamber paradigm described in the preceding paper to assess the dependence of the priming effect on D2-like dopamine receptors. We found that the priming effect also proved resilient to the effect of eticlopride, a selective D2-like receptor antagonist. The results are discussed within the framework of a new model of brain reward circuitry in which non-dopaminergic medial forebrain bundle fibers and dopamine axons provide parallel inputs to the final common paths for reward and incentive motivation.

                Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are essential determinants of late-onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) neuropathology. Here, we developed an integrative computational systems biology approach to construct causal network models of genetic regulatory programs for microglia in Alzheimer Disease (AD). This model enabled us to identify novel key driver (KDs) genes for microglial functions that can be targeted for AD pharmacotherapy. We prioritized FCER1G, HCK, LAPTM5, ITGB2, SLC1A2, PAPLN, GSAP, NTRK2, and CIRBP as KDs of microglial phagocytosis promoting neuroprotection and/or neural repair. In vitro, shRNA knockdown of each KD significantly reduced microglial phagocytosis. We repurposed riluzole, an FDA-approved ALS drug that upregulates SLC1A2 activity, and discovered that it stimulated phagocytosis of A{beta}1-42 in human primary microglia and decreased hippocampal amyloid plaque burden/phosphorylated tau levels in the brain of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, these data emphasize the utlility of our integrative approach for repurposing drugs for AD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying Patients with Cognitive Motor Dissociation Using Resting-state Temporal Stability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Using task-dependent neuroimaging techniques, recent studies discovered a fraction of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) who had no command-following behaviors but showed a clear sign of awareness, which was defined as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Although many efforts were made to identify the CMD, existing task-dependent approaches might fail when patients had multiple cognitive function (e.g., attention, memory) impairments, and thus lead to false-negative findings. However, recent advances in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis allow investigation of the dynamic change of spontaneous brain activity, which might be a powerful tool to test the patient's cognitive functions, while its capacity in identifying CMD was unclear. Methods: The rs-fMRI study included 119 participants from three independent research sites. A sliding-window approach was used to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity of the brain in two aspects: the global and regional temporal stability, which measures how stable the brain functional architecture is across time. The temporal stability was compared in the first dataset (36/16 DOC/controls), and then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built to discriminate DOC patients from controls. Furthermore, the generalizability of the SVM classifier was tested in the second independent dataset (35/21 DOC/controls). Finally, the SVM classifier was applied to the third independent dataset where patients underwent an rs-fMRI and brain-computer interface assessment (4/7 CMD/potential non-CMD), to test its performance in identifying CMD. Results: Our results showed that the global and regional temporal stability were impaired in DOC patients, especially in regions from the cingulo-opercular task control, default mode, fronto-parietal task control, and salience network. Using the temporal stability as features, the SVM model not only showed a good performance in the first dataset (accuracy = 90 %), but a good generalizability in the second dataset (accuracy = 82 %). Most importantly, the SVM model generalized well in identifying CMD in the third dataset (accuracy = 91 %). Conclusion: The current findings suggested that rs-fMRI could be a potential tool to assist in diagnosing CMD. Furthermore, the temporal stability investigated in this study also contributed to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanism of the consciousness.

                Although sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the US, its mechanistic underpinnings have not been fully determined. Thus, we set out to investigate whether changes in the peripheral sympathetic system could mediate the metabolic effects of SG. The celiac-superior mesenteric ganglia (CSMG) lie juxtaposed to the stomach and supply the sympathetic innervation of the stomach, as well as to numerous other intra-abdominal organs. Here we investigated the effects of SG on the CSMG. SG led to the degeneration of neurons in the CSMG, as evidenced by chromatolysis, which was not found in control mice. Furthermore, CSMG ablation (CGX) completely recapitulated the glycemic and weight loss effects of SG, promoting weight loss at the expense of fat mass. Norepinephrine tissue content measurement by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that liver, duodenum, and ileum were organs where both SG and CGX displayed evidence of significant sympathetic denervation. Both SG and CGX were associated with increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and high free fatty acid content in the stools. In conclusion, CSMG neuronal degeneration caused by SG may be a partial mediator of the metabolic effects of this type of bariatric surgery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macaque Brainnetome Atlas with Fine-grained Parcellations and Reliable Connections</a></h4>

              
                The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is a crucial experimental animal that shares many genetic, brain organizational, and behavioral characteristics with humans. A macaque brain atlas that identifies anatomically and functionally distinct regions is fundamental to biomedical and evolutionary research. However, even though connectivity information is vital for understanding brain functions, a connectivity-based whole-brain atlas of the macaque has not previously been made. In this study, we created a new whole-brain map, the Macaque Brainnetome Atlas, based on the anatomical connectivity profile provided by high-resolution angular and spatial diffusion MRI data. The new atlas consists of 248 cortical and 56 subcortical regions as well as their structural and resting-state functional connections. We systematically evaluated the parcellations and connections using multi-site and multi-modal datasets to ensure reproducibility and reliability. The resulting resource, which is downloadable from http://atlas.brainnetome.org, includes (1) the thoroughly delineated Macaque Brainnetome Atlas (MacBNA), (2) the multi-modal connections, (3) the largest postmortem high resolution macaque dMRI dataset, and (4) ex vivo MRI, block-face, and Nissl-stained images obtained from a different macaque. We provide an exemplar use of the resource with a joint multi-modal and multi-scale utilization of MRI and Nissl data with our atlas as a reference system. The goals of the resource are not only to provide a backbone of the mesoscopic connectivity and a multi-omics (such as transcriptomes and proteomes) atlas but also to facilitate translational medicine, cross-species comparisons, and computational modelling, enriching the collaborative resource platform of nonhuman primate data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct beta frequencies reflect categorical decisions</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations are involved in a variety of cognitive functions beyond their traditional sensorimotor role. Based on prior findings of content-specific beta synchronization during working memory and decision making, we hypothesized that beta activity supports the activation and reactivation of cortical representations by mediating neural ensemble formation within and between brain regions. We here found that beta activity in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and in pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) reflects the content of a stimulus in relation to the task context, regardless of its objective properties. In multiple versions of a categorization task, we changed the boundary between categories from one block of trials to the next, such that a stimulus which belonged to one of two categories during one block could belong to the other category during the next one. During a delay in which monkeys had to hold their categorical decision in mind, we found that two distinct beta-band frequencies were consistently associated with the same two relative categories, and that activity in these respective bands predicted the animals' responses. We characterized beta at these frequencies as transient bursts with distinct temporal profiles. We further showed that dlPFC and preSMA are connected via these distinct frequency channels, with dlPFC driving the frequency separation, a result supported by Granger causality and spike-field coherence analyses. In sum, these results provide support for the role of beta in forming neural ensembles, and further show that such ensembles synchronize at different beta frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Actigraphic Correlates of Neuropsychiatric Disability in Adult Patients with Focal Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Disability in patients with epilepsy (PWE) is multifactorial: beyond seizure frequency/severity, PWE are prone to a range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and somatic comorbidities that significantly impact quality of life. In this study, we explored how variations in epilepsy severity and the burden of self-reported somatic/neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with disruptions to 24h activity patterns (rest-activity rhythms, RARs), determined through wrist accelerometry/actigraphy. Continuous multiday recordings were obtained from 59 adult patients with focal epilepsy (44% male, ages 18-72), who contemporaneously provided responses to a range of validated psychometric instruments to measure the burden of anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and somatic symptoms. As a comparator, we conducted a similar psychometric-actigraphic correlation in 1761 subjects of Hispanic origin (35% male, ages 18-65) from the Study of Latinos (SOL) Sueno Ancillary Study. RARs were analyzed via a sigmoidally-transformed cosine model (quantifying RAR amplitude, steepness, acrophase and robustness) and non-parametric measures to estimate RAR stability, fragmentation, and sleep. Compared with age- and sex-matched SOL subjects, RARs from PWE subjects featured a significantly diminished amplitude, a wider rest phase and significantly more total daily sleep. Within PWE, similar RAR distortions were associated with seizure intractability and/or anticonvulsant polytherapy. In contrast, high anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores were associated with diminished RAR robustness and a delayed acrophase. We applied the complete SOL Sueno database to train logistic regression models to dichotomously classify anxiety, depression and sleepiness symptoms using age, sex, body mass index and a range of non-collinear RAR parameters. When tested on PWE, these models predicted prevalent anxiety and depression symptoms with modest success (accuracy ~70%) but failed to predict subjective sleepiness. Together, these results demonstrate that RAR features may vary with depression and anxiety symptoms in ambulatory patients with focal epilepsy, potentially offering a set of objective wearable-derived endpoints to adjunct routine clinical care and drug/device treatment trials. With larger actigraphic-psychometric datasets in PWE, we may identify RAR signatures that can more precisely distinguish between variations in seizure risk, the burden of anticonvulsant therapy and prevalent mood/anxiety symptoms.

                Knowledge about one's personality, the self-concept, shapes human experience. Social cognitive neuroscience has made strides addressing the question of where and how the self is represented in the brain. The answer, however, remains elusive. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments (with the second being preregistered) employing a self-reference task with a broad range of attributes and carrying out a searchlight representational similarity analysis. The importance of attributes to self-identity was represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas mPFC activation was unrelated both to self-descriptiveness of attributes (Experiments 1-2) and importance of attributes to a friend's self-identity (Experiment 2). Our research provides a comprehensive answer to the abovementioned question: The self-concept is conceptualized in terms of self-importance and represented in the mPFC.

	<p>The menstrual cycle affects women&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional states, with estrogen and progesterone having predominant roles. However, it remains unclear whether the phases of the menstrual cycle also affect women&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivational behaviors. In this study, the main aim was to investigate how the menstrual cycle influences approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behavior under conditions of conscious versus unconscious processing of emotions. Briefly, after recruitment by advertisement and screening with a menstrual cycle survey questionnaire, 27 naturally cycling, healthy women participated in an improved &amp;amp;ldquo;manikin task&amp;amp;rdquo; and were presented both positive and negative emotional stimuli during early follicular, late follicular, and mid-luteal phases. Estrogen and progesterone levels were measured. Women in the late follicular phase exhibited the shortest response times for approaching positive stimuli, while women in the mid-luteal phase exhibited the shortest response times for avoiding negative stimuli. Estrogen and progesterone levels significantly correlated with the speed of the approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance responses observed for the women, indicating the important role that sex hormones have in mediating emotionally motivated behavior. Overall, these findings suggest that the menstrual cycle has strong and specific influences on women&amp;amp;rsquo;s approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behaviors that are in part mediated by estrogen and progesterone. By identifying characteristics of these behaviors in the late follicular and mid-luteal phases, greater insight can be provided to women regarding the physiological influences of the menstrual cycle on their personal growth and security.</p>

	<p>The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This is due to the abundance of intuitions and several operational definitions from various fields that disagree about the sources or workload, its attributes, the mechanisms to aggregate these into a general model and their impact on human performance. This research built upon these issues and presents a novel method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing deep learning. This method is self-supervised, employing a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, and does not require human declarative knowledge. The aim is to induce models automatically from data, supporting replicability, generalisability and applicability across fields and contexts. This specific method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data, aimed at fitting a novel brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had, on average, a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error of around 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. These findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of automatically learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Additionally, across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus trained with data containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable and does not rely on ad hoc human crafted models.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Target temperature management (TTM) is often used in patients after cardiac arrest, but the effects of cooling on cerebral microcirculation, oxygenation and metabolism are poorly understood. We studied the time course of these variables in a healthy swine model.Methods: Fifteen invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated pigs were allocated to sham procedure (normothermia, NT; n = 5), cooling (hypothermia, HT, n = 5) or cooling with controlled oxygenation (HT-Oxy, n = 5). Cooling was induced by cold intravenous saline infusion, ice packs and nasal cooling to achieve a body temperature of 33&amp;amp;ndash;35 &amp;amp;deg;C. After 6 h, animals were rewarmed to baseline temperature (within 5 h). The cerebral microvascular network was evaluated (at baseline and 2, 7 and 12 h thereafter) using sidestream dark-field (SDF) video-microscopy. Cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler MNP100XP, Oxyflow, Oxford Optronix, Oxford, UK), oxygenation (PbtO2, Licox catheter, Integra Lifesciences, USA) and lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) using brain microdialysis (CMA, Stockholm, Sweden) were measured hourly. Results: In HT animals, cerebral functional capillary density (FCD) and proportion of small-perfused vessels (PSPV) significantly decreased over time during the cooling phase; concomitantly, PbtO2 increased and LPR decreased. After rewarming, all microcirculatory variables returned to normal values, except LPR, which increased during the rewarming phase in the two groups subjected to HT when compared to the group maintained at normothermia. Conclusions: In healthy animals, TTM can be associated with alterations in cerebral microcirculation during cooling and altered metabolism at rewarming.</p>

	<p>Delayed diagnosis and a lack of adequate care for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to worse outcomes and quality of life. This study aimed to identify the profile of service use, barriers to access care, and factors related to those barriers in Brazilian families with children with ASD. A total of 927 families with children with ASD (3&amp;amp;ndash;17 years) from five Brazilian regions completed an online version of the Caregivers Needs Survey. Results showed that the most used services were behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, while the most used professionals were neurologists, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pediatricians. The main barriers included waiting lists, costs, and the absence of services or treatment. Service use varied according to age, the region of residence, type of health care system used, and the parents/caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; education. Access to behavioral interventions was more frequent among users of the private system/health insurance and families whose caregivers had higher education. The absence of specialized services/treatments was less frequent among residents of state capitals and families whose caregivers had higher levels of education. This study highlights how families with children/adolescents with ASD in Brazil face significant barriers to access care related to sociodemographic factors.</p>

	<p>Action observation (AO) combined with motor imagery (MI) was verified as more effective in improving limb function than AO or MI alone, while the underlying mechanism of swallowing was ambiguous. The study aimed at exploring the efficacy of AO combined with MI in swallowing. In this study, twelve subjects performed the motor imagery of swallowing (MI-SW) during magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanning, and trials were divided into three groups: the non-induced group (control group, CG), male AO-induced group (M-AIG), and female AO-induced group (F-AIG). We used event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) and phase locking value (PLV) to assess the degree of activation and connectivity of the brain regions during MI-SW in the three groups. The results showed that compared to CG, F-AIG and M-AIG significantly activated more brain regions in the frontoparietal, attention, visual, and cinguloopercular systems. In addition, M-AIG significantly activated the sensorimotor cortex compared to CG and F-AIG. For the brain network, F-AIG and M-AIG increased the diffusion of non-hub hot spots and cold hubs to the bilateral hemispheres which enhanced interhemispheric functional connectivity and information transmission efficiency in the MI-SW task. This study provided supporting evidence that AO induction could enhance the effect of MI-SW and supported the application of AO-induced MI-SW in clinical rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background: The recent introduction of near-infrared spectroscopy has enabled the monitoring of cerebral blood flow in real-time. Previous studies have shown that blood flow velocity is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture is a predictor for cerebral infarction. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between postural-related changes in cerebral oxygenation and a history of chronic cerebral infarction. Methods: A total of 100 consecutive participants were enrolled in this study. We evaluated changes in cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture from the supine to the upright position in the bilateral forehead. The association between a decline in cerebral oxygenation and chronic cerebral infarction was analyzed with multiple logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Results: Cerebral blood oxygenation increased in 52 participants and decreased in 48 participants with a postural change. The prevalence of decreased cerebral oxygenation was 76.3% in participants with chronic cerebral infarction. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a decline in cerebral oxygenation upon a postural change was strongly associated with chronic cerebral infarction (adjusted odds ratio: 3.42, p = 0.025). Conclusions: Cerebral blood oxygenation upon a postural change could be a useful predictor for cerebral infarction.</p>

	<p>Sound-induced flash illusion (SiFI) is typical auditory dominance phenomenon in multisensory illusion. Although a number of studies have explored the SiFI in terms of age-related effects, the reasons for the enhanced SiFI in older adults are still controversial. In the present study, older and younger adults with equal visual discrimination were selected to explore age differences in SiFI effects, and to explore the neural indicators by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals. A correlation analysis was calculated to examine the relationship between regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the SiFI. The results showed that both younger and older adults experienced significant fission and fusion illusions, and fission illusions of older adults were greater than that of younger adults. In addition, our results showed ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were significantly positively correlated with the SiFI in older adults. More importantly, the comparison between older and younger adults showed that ReHo values of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) decreased in older adults, and this was independent of the SiFI. The results indicated that when there was no difference in unisensory ability, the enhancement of multisensory illusion in older adults may not always be explained by compensation mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in authorship demographics for manuscripts published in endocrine journals - A 70-year analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the previous few decades, trends in author demographics have significantly changed. Such trends have already been studied for many sub-specialties but endocrinology is among the few branches that are yet to see an analysis of such trends. This paper aims to fill this gap.  Methods: Journal of Endocrinology and General & Comparative Endocrinology are two landmark journals that publish articles from around the world. Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author – senior author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square. Results: Female first authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female and Female-Male combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.  Conclusion: In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

After the analysis, 356 compounds in ESI- and 543 compounds in ESI+ were identified successfully. Major compounds Alpha-Chlorohydrin (PubChem ID: 7290) and Tagatose (PubChem ID: 439312) were found in ESI+ and ESI-.   Discussion: The 10 metabolites from pinang yaki extract (ESI+) also have been indicated in preventing viral infection and have exhibited good neuroprotective immunity. Benzothiazole (PubChem ID: 7222), L-isoleucine (PubChem ID: 6306), D-glucono-delta-lactone (PubChem ID: 736), Diethylpyrocarbonate (PubChem ID: 3051), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) amine (PubChem ID: 7791), Cinnamic acid (PubChem ID: 444539), and Trigonelline (PubChem ID: 5570) also had potential effects as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory. Conclusion: Untargeted metabolomic profiling showed many bioactive compounds contained in pinang yaki (Areca vestiaria) extract. The top 10 compounds capable to ionize well have been identified and explored for their potential benefits as antiviral supplement products by literature study. This is a preliminary study which still needs further research such as in vitro, preclinical, and clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mulberroside A could serve as a pan inhibitor for the tyrosine kinase domains of the HER family [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Numerous medicines were authorized for their targeting of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of human epidermal receptors (HER). However, it has been demonstrated that these TKDs exhibit persistent resistance, necessitating the development of additional inhibitors with different modes of action. A single pharmacophore can be manipulated to create a pan-inhibitor where the binding site of these receptors has been highly conserved. The development of anti-cancer agents and the introduction of synergistic action to increase the efficacy of current medications have both recently benefited from the use of medicinal plants and herbal extracts as a reliable source. The binding affinity to the TKDs was predicted by molecular docking, followed by molecular dynamic simulation to examine the changes in the motion of the enzymes, with a focus on the components responsible for catalytic activity (C α-helix), activation (activation loop), and autophosphorylation (C-terminal loop). According to the ∆G value provided by Autodock Vina (-40.54, -40.12, -37.20, -37.62 kJ/mol for HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, respectively) and MM/PBSA, which indicates a strong affinity for the TKDs, the outcomes are undeniably positive. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and the principal component analysis (PCA) detected significant dynamic changes in the TKDs, particularly in the C α-helix and the activation loop for all TKDs, suggesting that mulberroside A may alter the function of these enzymes. This study will expand our understanding of the dynamics of the TKDs and shed light on the anticancer potential of the polyphenolic compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green campus universities: case studies on problems and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sustainability is a crucial social issue. In recent years, many scholars have suggested that the issue should be tackled at universities because they act as leaders in education, research and innovation. Universities are in a good position to foster progressive action towards global issues within current and future generations. As universities seek to create sustainable campuses, the green campus approach can create opportunities for a cultural paradigm shift, where universities become global leaders in sustainability. There have been various studies related to sustainability issues that include how universities can seek to create sustainable campuses. However, there are some gaps in the research on the “green campus approach” as a way to create sustainable campuses. This paper intends to examine the problems and prospects of creating a green campus university.   Methods: Data collection was conducted using the qualitative method. Structured interviews and observations were conducted via visits to the selected case-study universities as well as panels and discussions with experts in respective ministry and government agencies. All collected data were transcribed before being analysed using the NVivo software and thematic coding.  Results: Most universities in Malaysia have plans toward sustainability and the green campus approach. The awareness of going green and creating sustainability on university campuses has gradually increased. A strategic framework is needed as a guideline for creating green campuses in the higher education setting of Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study offers new insights into creating green campus universities in Malaysia as a means to create sustainability in higher education settings. The study involved three of the oldest universities in Malaysia. Future research may expand into other universities in Malaysia or internationally.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and identification of fluoride sensitive and fluoride resistant Streptococcus mutans strains from dental carries of diabetic patients using conventional methods in Sudan. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental caries also known as cavities are the most predominant disease today. Streptococcus mutans can form a biofilm on the tooth surface, produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars, and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties which are essential for oral micro biota. The aim of this study was to isolate S. mutans and characterize their antimicrobial properties against sodium fluoride. Fresh dental caries samples were collected from diabetic patients. The isolates were identified based on their acidogenic, biochemical test, and antimicrobial properties. Methods The socio-demographic data collected through a structure designated questionnaire and the biological data collected through sterile cotton swabs. For analysis of data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. Results Only 32 of the 80 samples (40%) gave a positive growth for S. mutans on MSBA (mitis salivarius bacitracin agar). The sensitivity of the isolates against sodium fluoride was tested by preparing NaF of four different concentrations (80, 125, 250, and 500) mg\L. Fifty percent of isolates were found to be resistant to NaF at a concentration of 80 mg/L, while 28% were resistant to 125 mg/L NaF, 16%   to 250 mg/L and 3% to 500mg/L NaF. The majority of the participants were aged between 51–60 years (33%), were female (54%), had type II diabetes mellitus (64%), and the duration of their diabetes was less than five years (35%). Conclusions By using the information in this study, we were able to discover strains of S. mutans that are resistant to fluoride. This study can be used as an essential key to study the genetic mutation that occurred.

                Background: Malnutrition is the imbalance between intake and nutritional needs, resulting in a decrease in body weight, composition, and physical function. Malnutrition causes infertility due to intestinal and liver degeneration,which may progress to testicular and ovarian degeneration. Methods: An infertile female rat model with a degenerative ovary was induced with malnutrition through a 5-day food fasting but still had drinking water. The administration of (T1) 30% (v/v) and (T2) 50% (v/v) forest honey (Apis dorsata) were performed for ten consecutive days, whereas the (T+) group was fasted and not administered forest honey and the (T−) group has not fasted and not administered forest honey. Superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, IL-13 and TNF-α cytokine expressions, and ovarian tissue regeneration were analyzed. Results: Superoxide dismutase was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (65.24±7.53), T2 (74.16±12.3), and T− (65.09±6.56) compared with T+ (41.76±8.51). Malondialdehyde was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (9.71±1.53), T2 (9.23±0.96), and T− (9.83±1.46) compared with T+ (15.28±1.61). Anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (5.30±2.31), T2 (9.80±2.53), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (2.70±1.57). Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (4.40±3.02), T2 (2.50±1.65), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (9.50±1.78). Ovarian tissue regeneration was significantly different (p<0.05) in T− (8.6±0.69) and T2 (5.10±0.99) compared with T1 (0.7±0.95) and T+ (0.3±0.67). Conclusion: The 10-day administration of 50% (v/v) forest honey can be an effective therapy for ovarian failure that caused malnutrition in the female rat model.

                Background: The volatilome of fermented food products are essential metabolites that significantly contribute to such foods’ overall composition and sensorial quality. The dataset presented herein represents the volatilome of raw and fermented maize flour samples. Methods: Maize grains were milled and naturally fermented at 35°C into sourdough at different periods (24, 48 and 72 h) and, at each point, the profile of the volatiles was investigated. Samples at the different fermentation periods were analyzed using solid phase microextraction coupled with a gas chromatography-high resolution time of flight-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-HRTOF-MS). Results: Data obtained were classified into different compound groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic compounds, esters, organic acids, terpenes, ketones, among others and their characteristics such as the retention time, observed mass, molecular formular, mean peak areas and mass spectra also presented. Conclusion: These datasets of fermented maize volatilome can be used as biomarkers for maize fermentation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global and gene-specific translational regulation in Escherichia coli across different conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Di Zhang, Sophia Hsin-Jung Li, Christopher G. King, Ned S. Wingreen, Zemer Gitai, Zhiyuan Li</p>

How well mRNA transcript levels represent protein abundances has been a controversial issue. Particularly across different environments, correlations between mRNA and protein exhibit remarkable variability from gene to gene. Translational regulation is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to mismatches between mRNA level and protein abundance in bacteria. Here, we quantified genome-wide transcriptome and relative translation efficiency (RTE) under 12 different conditions in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. By quantifying the mRNA-RTE correlation both across genes and across conditions, we uncovered a diversity of gene-specific translational regulations, cooperating with transcriptional regulations, in response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limitations. Intriguingly, we found that many genes regulating translation are themselves subject to translational regulation, suggesting possible feedbacks. Furthermore, a random forest model suggests that codon usage partially predicts a gene’s cross-condition variability in translation efficiency; such cross-condition variability tends to be an inherent quality of a gene, independent of the specific nutrient limitations. These findings broaden the understanding of translational regulation under different environments and provide novel strategies for the control of translation in synthetic biology. In addition, our data offers a resource for future multi-omics studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep mendelian randomization: Investigating the causal knowledge of genomic deep learning models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen Malina, Daniel Cizin, David A. Knowles</p>

Multi-task deep learning (DL) models can accurately predict diverse genomic marks from sequence, but whether these models learn the causal relationships between genomic marks is unknown. Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian randomization with <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the ‘true’ global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet, between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR’s causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.

Student's t-test and false discovery rate tests were performed for each of the differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® was used for the pathway expression analysis. CIBERSORT was used to esteem the abundances of different immune cell subsets in the tissues based on gene expression data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed between PCNSV and normal brain indicated that endosomal, mitochondrial and ribosome dysfunction, alterations in protein synthesis and non-coding RNAs might be involved in PCNSV. Pathway analysis revealed the activation of dendritic cell maturation and antigen processing as well as neuroinflammation in PCNSV <i>versus</i> normal brain, while oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. CIBERSORT estimation of immune cell subsets suggested that activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, memory B cells and follicular helper T cells were likely more prevalent in PCNSV samples. Naïve CD4 T cells and monocytes were mainly estimated to be present in GV and ABRA. Plasma cell and γδ T cell signatures were mainly found in LV and normal brain. GV showed higher levels of genes associated with macrophage activities and T cells. ABRA showed higher levels of long non-coding RNAs and miR-616. LV showed higher levels of genes encoding immunoglobulins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RNA sequencing confirmed PCNSV heterogeneity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Actigraphy Enables Home Screening of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potentially harmful, often overlooked sleep disorder affecting up to 70% of Parkinson's disease patients. Current diagnosis relies on nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive and cumbersome examination requiring specific clinical expertise. Here, we explored the use of wrist actigraphy to enable automatic RBD diagnoses in home settings.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 26 Parkinson's disease patients underwent 2-week home wrist actigraphy, followed by two in-laboratory evaluations. Patients were classified as RBD versus non-RBD based on dream enactment history and video-polysomnography. We comprehensively characterized patients' movement patterns during sleep using actigraphic signals. We then trained machine learning classification algorithms to discriminate patients with or without RBD using the most relevant features. Classification performance was quantified with respect to clinical diagnosis, separately for in-laboratory and at-home recordings. Performance was further validated in a control group of non-Parkinson's disease patients with other sleep conditions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>To characterize RBD, actigraphic features extracted from both (1) individual movement episodes and (2) global nocturnal activity were critical. RBD patients were more active overall, and showed movements that were shorter, of higher magnitude, and more scattered in time. Using these features, our classification algorithms reached an accuracy of 92.9 ± 8.16% during in-clinic tests. When validated on home recordings in Parkinson's disease patients, accuracy reached 100% over a 2-week window, and was 94.4% in non-Parkinson's disease control patients. Features showed robustness across tests and conditions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results open new perspectives for faster, cheaper, and more regular screening of sleep disorders, both for routine clinical practice and clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>In this study, we propose that the resilience of structural hub disruption compensated by functional connectivity in the DMN underlies the stable disability compensating by the aging of RRMS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease which leads to impairment in several functional systems including cognition. Alteration of brain networks is linked to disability and its progression. However, results are mostly cross-sectional and yet contradictory as putative adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms were found. Here, we aimed to explore longitudinal reorganization of brain networks over 2-years by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and a comprehensive neuropsychological-battery. In 37 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 39 healthy-controls, cognition remained stable over-time. We reconstructed network models based on the three modalities and analyzed connectivity in relation to the hierarchical topology and functional subnetworks. Network models were compared across modalities and in their association with cognition using linear-mixed-effect-regression models. Loss of hub connectivity and global reduction was observed on a structural level over-years (<i>p</i> &lt; .010), which was similar for functional MEG-networks but not for fMRI-networks. Structural hub connectivity increased in controls (<i>p</i> = .044), suggesting a physiological mechanism of healthy aging. Despite a general loss in structural connectivity in RRMS, hub connectivity was preserved (<i>p</i> = .002) over-time in default-mode-network (DMN). MEG-networks were similar to DTI and weakly correlated with fMRI in MS (<i>p</i> &lt; .050). Lower structural (<i>β</i> between .23–.33) and both lower (<i>β</i> between .40–.59) and higher functional connectivity (<i>β</i> = −.54) in DMN was associated with poorer performance in attention and memory in RRMS (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). MEG-networks involved no association with cognition. Here, cognitive stability despite ongoing neurodegeneration might indicate a resilience mechanism of DMN hubs mimicking a physiological reorganization observed in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enriched dietary saturated fatty acids induce trained immunity via ceramide production that enhances severity of endotoxemia and clearance of infection</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity is an innate immune memory response that is induced by primary microbial or sterile stimuli that sensitizes monocytes and macrophages to a secondary pathogenic challenge, reprogramming the host response to infection and inflammatory disease. Nutritional components, such as dietary fatty acids, can act as inflammatory stimuli, but it is unknown if they can act as the primary stimuli in the context of innate immune memory. Here we find mice fed a diet enriched exclusively in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; ketogenic diet; KD) confer a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased mortality, independent of diet-induced microbiome and glycemic modulation. We find KD mediates the composition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, and macrophages derived from the bone marrow of mice fed KD do not have altered baseline inflammation, but enhanced responses to a secondary inflammatory challenge. Lipidomics identified enhanced free palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated lipids in KD-fed mice serum. We found pre-treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA alone reprograms macrophages to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with LPS. This response was found to be dependent on the synthesis of ceramide, and reversible when treated with a ceramide synthase inhibitor. <i>In vivo</i>, we found systemic PA confers enhanced inflammation and mortality during an acute inflammatory response to systemic LPS, and this phenotype was not reversible for up to 7 days post-PA-exposure. While PA-treatment is harmful for endotoxemia outcome, we find PA exposure enhanced clearance of <i>Candida albicans</i> in <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further, we show that oleic acid (OA), a mono-unsaturated FA that depletes intracellular ceramide, reverses the PA-induced hyper-inflammatory response shown in macrophages treated with LPS, and reduces severity and mortality of LPS endotoxin stimulation, highlighting the plasticity of SFA-dependent enhanced endotoxemia severity <i>in vivo. </i>These are the first data to implicate enriched dietary SFAs, and specifically PA, in the induction of long-lived innate immune memory that is detrimental during an acute inflammatory response, but beneficial for clearance of pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural underpinning of a respiration-associated resting-state fMRI network</a></h4>

              
                Respiration can induce motion and CO<sub>2 </sub>fluctuation during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) scans, which will lead to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal. In the meantime, as a crucial physiologic process, respiration that can directly drive neural activity change in the brain, and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal. Nonetheless, this potential neural component in the respiration-fMRI relationship is largely unexplored. To elucidate this issue, here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology, rsfMRI and respiration signals in rats. Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes, evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiologic signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. In addition, this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an iso-electrical state, while the respiration is maintained, further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network. Taken together, this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, which represents a novel component in the respiration-rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel monocyte differentiation pattern in pristane-induced lupus with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Pristane causes chronic peritoneal inflammation resulting in lupus, which in C57BL/6 mice is complicated by lung microvascular injury and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Mineral oil (MO) also causes inflammation, but not lupus or DAH. Since monocyte depletion prevents DAH, we examined the role of monocytes in the disease. Impaired bone marrow (BM) monocyte egress in <i>Ccr2−</i>/− mice abolished DAH, confirming the importance of monocyte recruitment to the lung. Circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice exhibited increased annexin-V staining in comparison with MO-treated controls without evidence of apoptosis, suggesting that pristane alters the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane before or shortly after monocyte egress from the BM. Plasma membrane asymmetry also was impaired in Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> ‘patrolling’ monocytes, which are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors. Patrolling Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes normally promote endothelial repair, but their phenotype was altered in pristane-treated mice. In contrast to MO-treated controls, Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice were CD138<sup>+</sup>, expressed more TremL4, a protein that amplifies TLR7 signaling, and exuberantly produced TNFα in response to TLR7 stimulation. TremL4 expression on these novel CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes was regulated by Nr4a1. Thus, monocyte CD138, high TremL4 expression, and annexin-V staining may define an activated/inflammatory subtype of patrolling monocytes associated with DAH susceptibility. By altering monocyte development, pristane exposure may generate activated Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes, contributing to lung microvascular endothelial injury and DAH susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ X-ray assisted electron microscopy staining for large biological samples</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy of biological tissue has recently seen an unprecedented increase in imaging throughput moving the ultrastructural analysis of large tissue blocks such as whole brains into the realm of the feasible. However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples to be inefficient. Here we present an <i>in situ</i> time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that opens the 'black box' of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in potassium ferrocyanide reduced osmium solution. X-ray assisted staining gave access to the <i>in situ</i> staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion-reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in tissue. These are first steps towards <i>in silico</i> staining experiments and simulation-guided optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of mice, monkeys or humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism of Afadin substrate recruitment to the receptor phosphatase PTPRK via its pseudophosphatase domain</a></h4>

              
                Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a transmembrane receptor that links extracellular homophilic interactions to intracellular catalytic activity. Previously we showed that PTPRK promotes cell-cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating several cell junction regulators including the protein Afadin (Fearnley et al., 2019). Here we demonstrate that Afadin is recruited for dephosphorylation by directly binding to the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain. We mapped this interaction to a putative coiled coil (CC) domain in Afadin that is separated by more than 100 amino acids from the substrate pTyr residue. We identify the residues that define PTP specificity, explaining how Afadin is selectively dephosphorylated by PTPRK yet not by the closely related receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRM. Our work demonstrates that PTP substrate specificity can be determined by protein-protein interactions distal to the active site. This explains how PTPRK and other PTPs achieve substrate specificity despite a lack of specific sequence context at the substrate pTyr. Furthermore, by demonstrating that these interactions are phosphorylation-independent and mediated via binding to a non-catalytic domain, we highlight how receptor PTPs could function as intracellular scaffolds in addition to catalyzing protein dephosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and flexibility of the yeast NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex</a></h4>

              
                The NuA4 protein complex acetylates histones H4 and H2A to activate both transcription and DNA repair. We report the 3.1 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the central hub of NuA4, which flexibly tethers the HAT and TINTIN modules. The hub contains the large Tra1 subunit and a core that includes Swc4, Arp4, Act1, Eaf1 and the C-terminal region of Epl1. Eaf1 stands out as the primary scaffolding factor that interacts with the Tra1, Swc4 and Epl1 subunits and contributes the conserved HSA helix to the Arp module. Using nucleosome binding assays, we find that the HAT module, which is anchored to the core through Epl1, recognizes H3K4me3 nucleosomes with hyperacetylated H3 tails, while the TINTIN module, anchored to the core via Eaf1, recognizes nucleosomes that have hyperacetylated H2A and H4 tails. Together with the known interaction of Tra1 with site-specific transcription factors, our data suggests a model in which Tra1 recruits NuA4 to specific genomic sites then allowing the flexible HAT and TINTIN modules to select nearby nucleosomes for acetylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin recycling and activation</a></h4>

              
                Cells are subjected to multiple mechanical inputs throughout their lives. Their ability to detect these environmental cues is called mechanosensing, a process in which integrins play an important role. During cellular mechanosensing, plasma membrane (PM) tension is adjusted to mechanical stress through the buffering action of caveolae; however, little is known about the role of caveolae in early integrin mechanosensing regulation. Here, we show that Cav1KO fibroblasts increase adhesion to FN-coated beads when pulled with magnetic tweezers, as compared to wild type fibroblasts. This phenotype is Rho-independent and mainly derived from increased active b1-integrin content on the surface of Cav1KO fibroblasts. FRAP analysis and endocytosis/recycling assays revealed that active b1-integrin is mostly endocytosed through the CLIC/GEEC pathway and is more rapidly recycled to the PM in Cav1KO fibroblasts, in a Rab4 and PM tension-dependent manner. Moreover, the threshold for PM tension-driven b1-integrin activation is lower in Cav1KO MEFs than in wild type MEFs, through a mechanism dependent on talin activity. Our findings suggest that caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin cycling and activation, thereby regulating the early steps of the cellular mechanosensing response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Didemnin B and ternatin-4 differentially inhibit conformational changes in eEF1A required for aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation into mammalian ribosomes</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and accurate mRNA translation requires efficient codon-dependent delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosomal A site. In mammals, this fidelity-determining reaction is facilitated by the GTPase elongation factor-1 alpha (eEF1A), which escorts aa-tRNA as an eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex into the ribosome. The structurally unrelated cyclic peptides didemnin B and ternatin-4 bind to the eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex and inhibit translation but have different effects on protein synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we employ single-molecule fluorescence imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how these natural products inhibit translational elongation on mammalian ribosomes. By binding to a common site on eEF1A, didemnin B and ternatin-4 trap eEF1A in an intermediate state of aa-tRNA selection, preventing eEF1A release and aa-tRNA accommodation on the ribosome. We also show that didemnin B and ternatin-4 exhibit distinct effects on the dynamics of aa-tRNA selection that inform on observed disparities in their inhibition efficacies and physiological impacts. These integrated findings underscore the value of dynamics measurements in assessing the mechanism of small-molecule inhibition and highlight potential of single-molecule methods to reveal how distinct natural products differentially impact the human translation mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of SARS-CoV-2 M protein in lipid nanodiscs</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins incorporated into virions, spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M). M plays an essential role in viral assembly by organizing other structural proteins through physical interactions and directing them to sites of viral budding. As the most abundant protein in the viral envelope and a target of patient antibodies, M is a compelling target for vaccines and therapeutics. Still, the structure of M and molecular basis for its role in virion formation are unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 M in lipid nanodiscs to 3.5 Å resolution. M forms a 50 kDa homodimer that is structurally related to the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a viroporin, suggesting a shared ancestral origin. Structural comparisons reveal how intersubunit gaps create a small, enclosed pocket in M and large open cavity in ORF3a, consistent with a structural role and ion channel activity, respectively. M displays a strikingly electropositive cytosolic surface that may be important for interactions with N, S, and viral RNA. Molecular dynamics simulations show a high degree of structural rigidity in a simple lipid bilayer and support a role for M homodimers in scaffolding viral assembly. Together, these results provide insight into roles for M in coronavirus assembly and structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of PirtEGFPf mice in neuropathic pain condition</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct subtypes/clusters of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons may play different roles in nerve regeneration and pain. However, details about their transcriptomic changes under neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain, and we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons on day 7 post-CCI. By using <i>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></i> mice that selectively express an enhanced <i>green fluorescent protein</i> in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters and a loss of marker genes in injured neurons. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from several clusters were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated cell-type-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not in others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in DRG neurons after nerve injury. Using <i>Fgf3</i> as a proof-of-principle, RNAscope study provided further evidence of increased <i>Fgf3</i> in injured neurons after CCI, supporting scRNA-seq analysis, and calcium imaging study unraveled a functional role of <i>Fgf3</i> in neuronal excitability. These findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and the development of DRG neuron cell-type-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative splicing of apoptosis genes promotes human T cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing occurs in the vast majority of human genes, giving rise to distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. We, and others, have previously identified hundreds of genes that change their isoform expression upon T cell activation via alternative splicing; however, how these changes link activation input with functional output remains largely unknown. Here we investigate how costimulation of T cells through the CD28 receptor impacts alternative splicing in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (CD3) and find that while CD28 signaling alone has minimal impact on splicing, it enhances the extent of change for up to 20% of TCR-induced alternative splicing events. Interestingly, a set of CD28-enhanced splicing events occur within genes encoding key components of the apoptotic signaling pathway; namely caspase-9, Bax and Bim. Using both CRISPR-edited cells and antisense oligos to force expression of specific isoforms, we show for all three of these genes that the isoform induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation promotes resistance to apoptosis, and that changes in all three genes together function combinatorially to further promote cell viability. Finally, we show that the JNK signaling pathway, induced downstream of CD3/CD28 costimulation, is required for each of these splicing events, further highlighting their co-regulation. Together these findings demonstrate that alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which costimulation of CD28 promotes viability of activated T cells.

                Chronic pain affects millions of people worldwide. Studying pain insensitive individuals helps to identify novel analgesic strategies. Here we report how the recently discovered FAAH-OUT lncRNA-encoding gene, which was found from studying a pain insensitive patient with reduced anxiety and fast wound healing, regulates the adjacent key endocannabinoid system gene FAAH, which encodes the anandamide-degrading fatty acid amide hydrolase enzyme. We demonstrate that the disruption in FAAH-OUT lncRNA transcription leads to DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation within the FAAH promoter. In addition, FAAH-OUT contains a conserved regulatory element, FAAH-AMP, that acts as an enhancer for FAAH expression. Furthermore, using transcriptomic analyses we have uncovered a network of genes that are dysregulated from disruption of the FAAH-FAAH-OUT axis, thus providing a coherent mechanistic basis to understand the human phenotype observed and a platform for development of future gene and small molecule therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inference of Presynaptic Connectivity from Temporally Blurry Spike Trains by Supervised Learning</a></h4>

              
                Reconstruction of neural network connectivity is a central focus of neuroscience. The ability to use neuronal connection information to predict activity at single unit resolution and decipher its effect on whole systems can provide critical information about behavior and cognitive processing. Neuronal sensing modalities come in varying forms, but there is yet to exist a modality that can deliver readouts that sufficiently address the spatiotemporal constraints of biological nervous systems. This necessitates supplementary approaches that rely on mathematical models to mitigate physical limitations and decode network features. Here, we introduce a simple proof-of-concept model that addresses temporal constraints by reconstructing presynaptic connections from temporally blurry data. We use a variation of the perceptron algorithm to process firing rate information at multiple time constraints for a heterogenous feed-forward network of excitatory, inhibitory, and unconnected presynaptic units. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm under these conditions and determine the optimal learning rate, firing rate, and the ability to reconstruct single unit spikes for a given degree of temporal blur. We then test our method on a physiologically relevant configuration by sampling network subpopulations of leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models displaying bursting firing patterns and find comparable learning rates for optimized reconstruction of network connectivity. Our method provides a recipe for reverse engineering neural networks based on limited data quality that can be extended to more complicated readouts and connectivity distributions relevant to multiple brain circuits.

                Background: Childhood maltreatment exposure (CME) can lead to adverse long term consequences for the exposed individual. Emerging evidence suggests that the long term effect of CME may be transmitted across generations, starting already during prenatal development. Methods: In this study, we measured brain grey and white matter volumes from MR images in 62 healthy neonates at 2 to 5 weeks of gestation corrected age and obtained Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) questionnaire data from both parents. Results: We found that paternal CME associated positively with neonate supratentorial grey matter volumes while the association for the maternal TADS scores was not statistically significant. Maternal prepregnancy BMI associated with supratentorial white matter volumes, but not with parental CME. Conclusions: We are the first to report that paternal CME is linked with variation in newborn grey matter volume. Our results imply an intergenerational transmission of paternal CME to offspring. Elucidating the later relevance of these associations and mechanisms involved remains an enticing avenue for future studies.

                Fluorescence imaging is widely used for the mesoscopic mapping of neuronal connectivity. However, neurite reconstruction is challenging, especially when neurons are densely labelled. Here we report a strategy for the fully automated reconstruction of densely labelled neuronal circuits. Firstly, we established stochastic super-multicolour labelling with up to seven different fluorescent proteins using the Tetbow method. With this method, each neuron was labelled with a unique combination of fluorescent proteins, which were then imaged and separated by linear unmixing. We also established an automated neurite reconstruction pipeline based on the quantitative analysis of multiple dyes (QDyeFinder). To classify colour combinations, we used a newly developed unsupervised clustering algorithm, dCrawler, in which data points in multi-dimensional space were clustered based on a given threshold distance. Our new strategy allows for the reconstruction of neurites for up to hundreds of neurons at a millimetre scale without manual tracing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Synapses at the pillar IHC-side activate at lower voltages than those of the modiolar side, which show larger active zones and Ca2+-channel clusters. At the postsynapse, SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds and operating ranges. While it is tempting to speculate about a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we bridged this gap by ex-vivo paired recordings of IHCs and postsynaptic boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in-vivo SGN-characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate (SR) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage-thresholds, shorter response latencies and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs can account for functional response diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Granule cells affect dendritic tree selection in purkinje cells during cerebellar development</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the interrelationship between primary dendrite selection of Purkinje cells and migration of their pre-synaptic partner granule cells during cerebellar development. During development of the cerebellar cortex, each Purkinje cell grows more than three dendritic trees, from which a primary tree is selected to develop further, whereas the others completely retract. Experimental studies suggest that this selection process is coordinated by physical and synaptic interactions with granule cells. However, technical limitations hinder a continuous experimental observation of multiple populations. To reveal the mechanism underlying this selection process, we constructed a computational model of dendritic developments and granule cell migrations, using a new computational framework, NeuroDevSim. Comparisons of the resulting morphologies from the model demonstrate the roles of the selection stage in regulating the growth of the selected primary trees. The study presents the first computational model that simultaneously simulates growing Purkinje cells and the dynamics of granule cell migrations, revealing the role of physical and synaptic interactions upon dendritic selection. The model provides new insights about the distinct planar morphology of Purkinje cell dendrites and about roles of the dendritic selection process during the cerebellar development. The model also supports the hypothesis that synaptic interactions by granule cells are likely to be involved in the selection procedure.

	<p>Female-specific risk factors for stroke have gradually received attention. The relationship between ischemic stroke and adenomyosis, a benign uterine disorder commonly present in parous women, is underrecognized. We aimed to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, diagnostic considerations, and potential therapeutic strategies of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. We shared our experience with the diagnosis and management of a patient, and summarized current findings and knowledge gaps of this disease based on previous literature. The relevant studies were searched in English and Chinese databases up to April 2022 using the keywords &amp;amp;ldquo;ischemic stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral infarction&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;adenomyosis&amp;amp;rdquo;. Then, we provided a narrative review of the retrieved articles. Finally, the data of 32 cases were analyzed. We found that increased levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 and D-dimer and decreased level of hemoglobin are biomarkers of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. In addition, hypercoagulability might be a key mechanism leading to thromboembolism in the cerebrovascular system. Additional studies are needed to find optimal prevention strategies for the disease. A better understanding of this &amp;amp;ldquo;rare&amp;amp;rdquo; pathogenesis of ischemic stroke may inform a more precise diagnosis and effective prevention strategy in middle-aged women with embolic stroke of undetermined source.</p>

	<p>This study pursued two goals: (1) to establish range of motion (ROM) demand tiers (i.e., low, moderate, high) specific to the jaw (J), lower lip (LL), posterior tongue (PT), and anterior tongue (AT) for multisyllabic words based on the articulatory performance of neurotypical talkers and (2) to identify demand- and disease-specific articulatory performance characteristics in talkers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). J, LL, PT, and AT movements of 12 talkers with ALS, 12 talkers with PD, and 12 controls were recorded using electromagnetic articulography. Vertical ROM, average speed, and movement duration were measured. Results showed that in talkers with PD, J and LL ROM were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier whereas PT and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at moderate and high tiers. In talkers with ALS, J ROM was significantly reduced at the moderate tier whereas LL, PT, and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at the highest tier. In both clinical groups, significantly reduced J and LL speeds could already be observed at the lowest tier whereas significantly reduced AT speeds could only be observed at the highest tier. PT speeds were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier in the ALS group but not until the moderate tier in the PD group. Finally, movement duration, but not ROM or speed performance, differentiated between ALS and PD even at the lowest tier. Results suggest that articulatory deficits vary with stimuli-specific motor demands across articulators and clinical groups.</p>
