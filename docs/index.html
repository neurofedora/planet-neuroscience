              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-748/v2?src=rss">Analysis of seasonal changes in vegetation cover in the La Caimanera marsh (Colombia) using remote sensing and satellite sensor imagery [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Mangroves are ecosystems that link freshwater, land, and oceans. They are also home to vast biodiversity of species and provide vital resources to many coastal communities worldwide. However, in various parts of the world, these natural ecosystems have been subjected to anthropogenic actions that compromise their subsistence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse seasonal changes in vegetation cover in the La Caimanera marsh (Colombia) using remote sensing and satellite sensor imagery. Methodologically, machine learning techniques were used, including semi-supervised and supervised learning, using Landsat, Copernicus, and Planet images. The influence of mangrove vegetation cover on pollutants was explored using remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. The results obtained indicated that in 2015 and 2024, the ecosystem showed stability, with slight reductions in mangrove cover and water bodies. In contrast, a slight increase in urbanized areas was also evident. The NDWI, MNDWI, OC3, and QAA spectral indices were used to monitor water dynamics and water quality. The results reflected stability in water conditions between 2010 and 2020, with a slight reduction in 2023. The increase in chlorophyll-a and reduction in turbidity in 2023 showed alterations in water quality. In addition, the predominance of mature mangrove trees, which comprised 83% of the vegetation, is noteworthy, reflecting a healthy and stable ecosystem. The greater density and homogeneity of the mangrove canopy observed in this study suggests a positive ecosystem response and greater resilience to past environmental changes. It is concluded that the changes experienced by the La Caimanera marsh reflect a balance between conservation and development, highlighting the effectiveness of territorial management policies implemented to maintain the ecosystem’s resilience in the face of human pressures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1214/v2?src=rss">Balancing Sustainability and Specimen Protection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection.

">Subspace communication in the hippocampal-retrosplenial axis</a></h4>

              
                The capacity and flexibility of hippocampal circuits for transforming inputs into downstream outputs is fundamental for navigation and memory, yet the circuit-level mechanisms that allow this operation to adapt across experiences remain unknown. We approach this problem by performing large-scale (up to 1024-channel) recordings across the hippocampal-retrosplenial cortex (RSC) circuit in behaving mice, enabling simultaneous access to spiking activity in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, CA1, RSC. Based on a linear dimensionality reduction technique known as partial canonical correlation analysis, we identify low-dimensional communication subspaces1 between two regions while accounting for measured third-area influences. These subspaces captured distinct input-output transformations in CA1, linking upstream (DG, CA3, and CA2) hippocampal activity to downstream cortical targets (RSC). Iintrinsic firing properties and anatomical location constrained subspace memberships--members were mapped to deep sublayers of the CA3-CA1-RSC axis during both spatial and non-spatial tasks. These subspaces could recombine overlapping neuronal pools to support distinct interareal interactions across changing experiences and brain states. Reactivation patterns of CA1-CA3 subspaces, but not those of CA1-RSC, during post-experience sleep correlated with replay, reflecting a plasticity-stability balance of the input-output transformation in the hippocampal-retrosplenial axis. Our data suggest a model in which hippocampal-neocortical communication reconfigures predetermined circuit motifs to flexibly encode experiences.

">Meta-learning is expressed through altered prefrontal cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Learning where and when rewards like food and water are available is essential for survival. In the simplest cases where resource availability is stable, animals can learn reward contingencies by integrating outcomes across repeated samples of each option. In more natural settings, however, reward availability is governed by complex contingencies such as depletion and repletion over time. To flexibly adapt to such changing environments, optimal choices require meta-learning wherein animals learn how to learn from external feedback, eventually enabling them to infer reward contingencies from more abstract and generalizable rules rather than relying solely on recent outcomes. The existence of meta-learning in animal behavior is well established, yet the neural circuits and computations that implement it remain poorly understood. Here we investigated meta-learning using a spatial foraging task in which rats acquired a novel depletion-repletion rule, and carried out longitudinal, high-density recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We show that meta-learning engages specific, systematic changes in mPFC neural dynamics that embed the learned rule and thereby alter the way the network learns option values from reward outcomes. These dynamics are based on mixed coding of task structure and value in individual mPFC neurons which, at the population level, organize into low-dimensional dynamical motifs that generalize across task conditions. As meta-learning progresses, these motifs are reshaped to instantiate both rule-guided inference of future states before outcome delivery and rule-based value updating during the outcome period. These results indicate that meta-learning sculpts pre-existing prefrontal dynamics to support the acquisition of new reward-learning strategies.

">Sex-specific relationships between stress coping and avoidancebehavior</a></h4>

              
                While the experience of stress is ubiquitous, the risk of developing stress-linked conditions such as anxiety and depression is related to maladaptive stress responses. In order to probe the relationship between stress coping, sex, and stress-linked behavioral outcomes, we exposed male and female mice to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) and measured the correlation between coping during the tail suspension stressors (TSS) of SCVS and avoidance behavior in the EPM. We found that females engage in more active coping, and there were no sex differences in avoidance or locomotor behavior in the EPM after stress. However, we found that greater active coping predicted greater avoidance in females, but less avoidance in males. The results demonstrate that coping strategies are dynamic across time in males and females, but the relationships between avoidance and coping strategy dynamics are sex-biased.

">SEZ6L2 Loss Disrupts Motor Coordination, Cognitive Function, and Synaptic Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The SEZ6 family, composed of SEZ6, SEZ6L, and SEZ6L2, plays essential roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic organization, and complement regulation. However, the specific contribution of SEZ6L2 to brain function remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive behavioral and neurobiological characterization of Sez6l2 knockout (KO) mice and directly compare their phenotype with Sez6 triple knockout (TKO) mice, which lack all three Sez6 family genes. Sez6l2 KO mice exhibit impairments across multiple behavioral domains, including motor coordination, gait, sociability, sensory processing, and goal-directed repetitive behaviors. Several phenotypes, particularly motor deficits, worsen with age. Male Sez6l2 KO mice also demonstrate enhanced fear learning and increased prepulse inhibition, revealing sex-specific alterations in sensorimotor gating. At the synaptic level, Sez6l2 KO mice show reduced dendritic spine length and decreased expression of key postsynaptic proteins suggesting impaired excitatory synaptic connectivity. These structural and molecular abnormalities likely contribute to the observed behavioral deficits. In comparison, Sez6 TKO mice display more severe impairments across most measures. Together, these findings establish SEZ6L2 as a critical and non-redundant regulator of motor, cognitive, and synaptic function and provide mechanistic insight into how dysfunction within the SEZ6 family may contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

">Progenitor Diversity and Architecture of the Human Ganglionic Eminences Shaping the Basal Ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The embryonic medial and lateral ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE) are the principal sources of most neurons and glia for the basal ganglia. In primates, the MGE has a distinctive cytoarchitecture characterized by doublecortin enriched cellular nests (DENs), yet the architectonic organization underlying DEN formation, the molecular heterogeneity of ganglionic eminence progenitors and their lineage relationships, remain poorly understood. Here, using paired single-nucleus transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling of the three GEs, we identify distinct progenitor populations, delineate their gene regulatory networks, and reconstruct their lineage trajectories. Live imaging reveals a unipolar outer radial glia-like population (GE-oRG) that undergoes mitotic somal translocation. Spatial transcriptomics identifies a distinct CRABP1+/ANGPT2+ domain within the MGE. Integrated spatial and electron microscopy demonstrates a periphery-to-center gradient of differentiation in the MGE. Leveraging DEN-forming MGE organoids derived from PCDH19 knockout human pluripotent stem cell lines, we identify the protocadherin, PCDH19, as a key regulator of DEN formation.

">Intrinsic excitability of rat hippocampal granule cells increases along the dorsal-to-ventral axis</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus exhibits striking anatomical and functional heterogeneity along its dorsoventral axis, yet the intrinsic electrophysiological diversity of its principal excitatory neurons, the granule cells, across the dorsoventral axis remains unexplored. Here, we systematically examined the electrophysiological properties of DG granule cells across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral regions of the rat hippocampus. We found a progressive increase in input resistance, impedance amplitude, and firing rate of granule cells, accompanied by a gradual slowdown in repolarization kinetics of their action potentials along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Our analyses demonstrated that granule cells acted as class I integrators that lacked strong resonance properties across the dorsoventral axis. We performed pairwise correlation and dimensionality reduction analyses to reveal weak dependencies across physiological measurements and the absence of distinct clusters for dorsal, intermediate, or ventral granule cells. Importantly, blade-specific analyses of granule cell physiology revealed that all measurements manifested pronounced heterogeneities even within a given dorsoventral section and a specific blade. Strikingly, ventral granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade manifested higher firing rates compared to their counterparts in the suprapyramidal blade. These blade-specific differences were limited to the ventral granule cells, with negligible distinctions between granule cells in the two blades of either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus. Together, our findings unveil a progressive increase in excitability of DG granule cells along the dorsal-to-ventral axis and a blade-specific granularity of firing properties, adding new dimensions to the several known anatomical, molecular, and behavioral differences across the hippocampal dorsoventral axis.

<p>Retro-orbital injection of AAV-PHP.eB-FLEX-tdTomato into four different strains of Cre mice produced various and distinct patterns of transduction efficiency and tropism across brain regions and cell types. We found many target neurons expressing tdTomato in most but not all strains, along with a low level of nonspecific (Cre-independent) expression across brain regions in every strain and in C57BL/6J mice.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Investigating the molecular and functional identity of specific neuronal populations is a critical component of neuroscience research. Specific brain regions can be targeted with stereotaxic injections of viral vectors that deliver recombinase-dependent genetic tools, but this approach cannot target widely distributed neuronal populations. Peripheral injection is a potential strategy to access widely distributed populations, and unlike most viral vectors, PHP.eB penetrates the blood–brain barrier. However, many neurotropic viruses have tropism for specific neuronal subtypes, and it is unclear if PHP.eB transduces neurons equally across brain regions. To evaluate tropism and transduction efficiency, we examined the brain after retro-orbital injections of a PHP.eB vector that delivers a Cre-dependent reporter in a variety of Cre mice. We observed widely variable transduction efficiency across brain regions and cell types. Additionally, we found scattered neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain in all Cre-driver strains, as well as Cre-negative control mice, indicating that a low rate of spontaneous recombination had occurred. These results confirm that peripheral delivery of PHP.eB can transduce widely distributed neuronal populations. However, variations in tropism, sensitivity, and specificity merit careful consideration for each population of interest.</p>

                <p>by Danfeng Chen, John D. Storey</p>

The admixture model is widely applied to estimate and interpret population structure among individuals. Here we consider a “standard admixture” model that assumes the admixed populations are unrelated and also a generalized model, where the admixed populations themselves are related via coancestry (or covariance) of allele frequencies. The generalized model yields a potentially more realistic and substantially more flexible model that we call “super admixture”. This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model. The super admixture model therefore provides a tractable, forward-generating probabilistic model of complex structure and relatedness that should be useful in a variety of scenarios.

                Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Biden rightly characterized the current era of great power competition as one that occurs between democracies vs autocracies; thus, democracies need a new kind of deterrence concept against emboldened autocrats, as exemplified in Mikael Wigell’s ‘democratic deterrence’ that calls for greater apprehension of –and confidence in—democratic advantage argument in the public consciousness. Democratic middle powers in general could play an important part in the aforementioned democratic deterrence in their own respective capacities, and the third largest democracy, in particular, has the potential to play a unique role in promoting a democratic advantage narrative, especially in the case of the compatibility of democracy with Islam through the principle of Maqashid Sharia. This study makes three recommendations for Indonesia to fulfill its potential role. First, Indonesia needs to accelerate its democratic consolidation process by raising the public’s emancipative values, especially through cognitive mobilization but allied with religions. Second, democratic advantage apprehension must be integrated within traditional foreign policy principles, as the two are not at all contradictory. Finally, the West in general, and United States in particular, need to be more appreciative and supportive of Indonesia’s effort to play a middle-power stabilizing role in the Indo-Pacific, whether in the forms of economic or defense cooperation.

                Abstract* Background Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) is a natural resin rich in biologically active compounds, especially boswellic acids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties. Plant extracts have become valuable in the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles because they act as safe, low-cost and stabilizing agents, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical methods. Methods In this study, silver oxide nanoparticles were prepared using an aqueous extract of Boswellia carterii. The extract was obtained by dissolving 1 g of crude resin in 100 mL of deionized water, heating at 50°C, and filtering to remove insoluble material. A 1 mM solution of silver nitrate was prepared by dissolving 0.015 g of AgNO₃ in 100 mL of water. The silver solution was added gradually to the warm extract under continuous stirring, and the mixture was heated up to 140°C for 50 minutes until a dark brown color appeared, indicating nanoparticle formation. The product was then centrifuged, washed several times, and left to dry. Structural characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction, and the crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation. Particle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results The antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species at concentrations of 60%, 80%, and 100%. The XRD results confirmed the formation of silver oxide with an orthorhombic crystalline structure corresponding to standard reference data, with an average crystallite size of 80.6 nm. SEM images revealed that the particles were relatively uniform in distribution, with diameters ranging from 55.84 to 82.17 nm. Antibacterial testing showed clear inhibition zones measuring between 14.5 and 23 mm for both bacterial strains, with a stronger effect observed against Streptococcus. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that Boswellia carterii extract can serve as an effective natural agent for the green synthesis of silver oxide nanoparticles, producing particles with suitable structural characteristics and notable antibacterial activity.

                Orthogonality is an important concept in normed spaces, and many generalizations of this concept have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of orthogonality in normed spaces, denoted by ϼ LM -orthogonality, which is related to ϼ ∗ -orthogonality. The fundamental properties of this new concept are systematically analyzed, including symmetry, non-negativity, scalar homogeneity, linear independence of orthogonal vectors, the Cauchy–Schwarz type inequality, the zero property, and other characteristics. We also explain the relationship between this new definition and some other well-known types of orthogonality.

                The fundamental tasks of function approximation and numerical integration on the sphere from scattered data nodes present significant challenges, including the curse of dimensionality, the instability of high-degree polynomial methods, and the limitations of existing approaches that often require specially structured node sets. This paper introduces a novel framework that seamlessly integrates Weighted Least Squares (WLS) polynomial approximation, using spherical harmonics and Voronoi-based weights, with a consensus-based optimization strategy for decentralized computation, specifically designed for large, distributed datasets. Our results show that this method provides stable and accurate approximation even with high-degree polynomials on arbitrary, unstructured node sets, ensuring a well-conditioned system. It also leads to the construction of a novel quadrature rule with provably positive weights, guaranteeing stability for numerical integration. We derive rigorous theoretical error bounds that explicitly connect the accuracy of the method to the density of the node set and the polynomial degree. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our framework outperforms standard least squares and classical scattered-data quadrature rules in both stability and accuracy. We conclude that this consensus-based WLS framework offers a robust, scalable, and distributed solution for a wide range of spherical problems, with significant potential impact in scientific computing and data analysis.

                Background The context of this study is the ethical dilemma faced by humanitarian organizations’ (HOs’) executives. This study examines the ways in which regulators determine the degree to which program expense allocations should be limited or prohibited, whereas there is a lack of consensus in the literature. California has moderate regulations on the expense allocations of not-for-profit organizations’(NFPs’) programs. These regulations can influence those of other states and foreign countries. Methods Actual data from Japan, a country with regulations influenced by California, can provide clues on how to resolve disagreements. Through the adoption of a combination of mechanism design and k-means clustering, this study explains how regulators can optimize regulations on HOs’ program expense allocations. Results The k-means clustering results were calculated. There were 966 cases in the first cluster and 37 in the second cluster. The cluster center of the first cluster was 9,343 in JPY, and the cluster center of the second cluster was 160,581 in JPY. The required number of repeats was 12. 34% is the breakpoint ratio for sanctions to be imposed. Conclusions A way to achieve this goal is to intentionally limit the scale of imposed sanctions on expense allocations while maintaining some necessary sanctions to maintain mutual trust within the donation market. The identified research gap is lying around HOs. Transparency also has the dark side and stakeholders have competing interest, while transparency is usually necessary for NFPs to be accountable. This is the gap. While the findings here contradict the views of some rating organizations, intentional adoption of moderate regulations fulfills the research gap.

                Background: Quantitative measurements of vitreous inflammation using vitreous/retinal pigment epithelium-relative intensity (VIT/RPE-Relative Intensity) have been described recently. In proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis, inducing retinal fibrosis and contraction. However, no attempts have yet to be made to analyze the severity of inflammation in PVR progression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing OCT image sets obtained from patients divided into four groups: (1) proliferative vitreoretinopathy, (2) intermediate and posterior uveitis, (3) panuveitis, (4) normal healthy eyes in Cipto Mangunkusumo Kirana Eye Hospital between April 2021 – December 2021. OCT images were then analyzed in the ImageJ software for VIT/RPE-relative intensity. Results: A total of 19 PVR eyes, 12 intermediate-posterior uveitis eyes, 16 panuveitis eyes, and 28 normal healthy eyes were recruited for this study. The VIT/RPE-Relative Intensity was significantly higher in PVR eyes (0.415±0.178) than in intermediate-posterior uveitis (0.236±0.043, p=0.002) and panuveitis eyes (0.30±0.07, p=0.023). Compared to the normal eyes, PVR and both uveitis groups have significantly higher VIT/RPE relative intensity (p = <0.001 in each group). Conclusions: VIT/RPE-relative intensity may offer quantitative measurements of vitreous inflammation in the role of the pathogenesis of PVR. Comparison with cellular inflammation in the vitreous is required to validate this finding.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was conducted from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome for this analysis was the effect of physical activity (PA) or exercise on depressive symptoms in people with TRD and NRD diagnosis. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention. However, except for one article, all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve various traits in TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dysautonomia affects many patients with Parkinson's disease and correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality. We describe the frequency and onset time of autonomic dysfunction relative to disease onset in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and explore its association with mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified all incident Parkinson cases with motor-symptom onset before age 50 years evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Health System (1990–2022) including sex- and age-matched controls for each patient. Medical record review confirmed clinical diagnosis and assessed the presence and onset of autonomic symptoms, relative to Parkinson onset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 829 patients with EOPD and 829 healthy controls. The median age at disease onset was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 37–46 years). Autonomic symptoms were present in 63.4% of patients, compared with 27.0% of unaffected controls, and proceeded motor symptoms in 91.4%. Forty-seven percent of patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease had constipation, 27.4% had bladder urgency, 19.3% had orthostatic intolerance, and 15.4% had sweat dysfunction. Among male patients, 36.8% had erectile dysfunction. In our EOPD population only, the presence of any autonomic-impairment symptoms correlated with a 2.71-fold increased mortality risk; each additional reported symptom increased the relative mortality risk by 50% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Patients with constipation or orthostatic intolerance had a 3.22- and 2.78-fold higher mortality than patients without these symptoms.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Autonomic impairment affects 63.4% of patients with EOPD and carries a 3-fold higher mortality risk, which increases with every additional autonomic symptom reported. In our cohort, autonomic symptoms appeared most commonly after motor onset, contrasting with prodromal autonomic impairment seen in late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD).

     alt="Presumed Glomerular Neuropils in the Central Nervous Systems of Spiders (Araneae)"/>
<p>Spiders sense chemicals in their environment with particular sensory hairs (sensilla) on their legs and feelers. Chemosensory neurons inside these sensilla send their axons into the central nervous system (CNS) where these neurons terminate in clusters of small glomeruli (‘glom a’). Axons from each leg terminate in their respective segments of the CNS. These glomeruli have been revealed by osmium staining as well as by applying tracers to the sensilla out on the legs. Another kind of glomeruli (glom b) reside in a glomerular cluster in the center of the CNS. The large size of some of those glomeruli in males (but not in females) suggests their involvement in pheromone perception.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>While spiders are known for their tactile and vibratory senses, their sense of smell has not been well researched at all. Only relatively few behavioral studies have been published showing that spiders can perceive pheromones and may be able to smell prey or predators. Less is known about the nature of their olfactory neurons and sense organs (sensilla), and nothing is known about how and where olfactory information is processed in the spider's central nervous system. This comparative anatomical study is the first to describe presumed chemosensory glomeruli in the central nervous system of spiders. Such glomeruli are the anatomical hallmark of olfactory processing in other taxa. This study finds presumed olfactory glomeruli residing ventrally in each neuromere of the legs and pedipalps (feelers) of all spider families examined. Unlike olfactory glomeruli in most insects or vertebrates, in spiders, these presumed chemosensory glomeruli are often elongated rather than spherical. Anterograde tracing of neurons originating from chemosensory sensilla on the legs shows that these presumed chemosensory glomeruli are supplied by primary chemosensory afferents, at least some of which may supply more than one glomerulus. In addition, a previously described central structure, referred to as the Blumenthal neuropil and presumed to receive hygro- and thermo-sensory input, is here shown to also comprise glomerular components. One or more of these central Blumenthal glomeruli are particularly large in male spiders. In analogy to insect macroglomeruli, this suggests that these glomeruli might be involved in processing pheromone information. These findings are discussed with reference to insect and vertebrate olfactory information processing.</p>

     alt="Long-Term Hand Rehabilitation After Sensorimotor Cortical Injury Promotes Massive Upregulation of Corticospinal Terminations From Spared Supplementary Motor Cortex in Macaca mulatta"/>
<p>Following unilateral sensorimotor cortical injury, the authors show long-term rehabilitation of the severely impaired hand results in substantial contralateral corticospinal projection (cCSP) terminal increases from spared supplementary motor cortex (M2) (right column) compared to controls (center column). Thus, long-term hand rehabilitation may promote spared cCSP terminal upregulation in some stroke patients. Conversely, long-term rehabilitation of the less affected hand results in catastrophic cCSP terminal loss (left column), suggesting massive loss of spared cCSP terminals may occur in patients who preferentially use the nondominant ipsilesional hand or develop learned nonuse. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Two female rhesus monkeys experienced 6 months of forced-use upper-extremity rehabilitation following localized damage to the sensorimotor cortex. One monkey received rehabilitation of the severely affected (contralesional) hand to model traditional poststroke therapeutic intervention. The second monkey received the same rehabilitation paradigm, but of the less affected (ipsilesional) hand, to model patients who preferentially use their ipsilesional hand or develop learned nonuse of the contralesional hand. Changes in the terminal distribution of the corticospinal projection (CSP) at C5–T1 from spared supplementary motor cortex (M2) were studied using high-resolution anterograde tracers and stereology. M2 CSP findings were compared to the M2 CSP in animals receiving the same sensorimotor cortical lesion but with no rehabilitative intervention (natural recovery; <i>n</i> = 4), and controls (no lesion-no rehabilitation; <i>n</i> = 5). Rehabilitation of the severely affected hand induced massive upregulation of contralateral M2 CSP terminals compared to naturally recovered and control groups. Terminal increases occurred in lamina VII compared to both groups, and in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral quadrants of motoneuron lamina IX compared to the naturally recovered lesion group. In contrast, rehabilitating the less affected hand induced substantial contralateral terminal loss compared to both groups. Our findings demonstrate that long-term rehabilitation of the severely impaired hand following sensorimotor cortex injury promotes spared M2 corticospinal sprouting, possibly reflecting favorable corticospinal adaptations accompanying repetitive upper-limb rehabilitation in some stroke patients. Extensive M2 CSP loss following rehabilitation of the less impaired hand indicates a risk of losing spared CSPs in patients who preferentially use their ipsilesional hand or develop learned nonuse.</p>

                <p>Drug trial design is at an inflection point in epilepsy and neurological disorders. We are moving from conventional parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to other designs, such as n-of-1 trials.

For Dravet syndrome, RCTs have demanded 4 or more seizures/month in the baseline period. However, only 25% of children have sufficiently frequent seizures to qualify for RCTs. Trial outcomes should be tailored to the disease and long-term issues for patients, a much broader remit than seizure frequency alone. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Abstract* Background Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm driven by the BCR–ABL1 fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib and nilotinib, have transformed CML management by significantly improving hematologic and molecular responses. However, real-world data from low- to middle-income countries, including Indonesia, remain limited. Objective This study aimed to evaluate early hematologic responses after three months of TKI therapy in CML patients and to assess the influence of demographic and clinical factors on treatment outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, reviewing medical records of 43 adult CML patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib from January to December 2024. Hematologic parameters were analyzed at baseline and monthly for three months. Associations between treatment response and patient characteristics were assessed using GLM-Repeated Measures and MANOVA. Results Both TKI regiments significantly improved hematologic parameters (p < 0.001), with reductions in leukocyte counts and increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. No significant interaction was found between time and treatment type (p > 0.05), indicating comparable efficacy. Patients receiving nilotinib showed a higher rate of complete response (60%) than those on imatinib (32.1%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.078). Body weight and BMI significantly influenced hematologic improvements (p < 0.05), while age did not. Conclusion Imatinib and nilotinib both effectively induce early hematologic responses in CML patients. While nilotinib showed a trend toward superior outcomes, statistical equivalence suggests both remain viable options. BMI and body weight are important predictors of response, highlighting the need for individualized treatment strategies. Further large-scale studies with extended follow-up are warranted to confirm long-term benefits and refine patient-specific therapy.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                Recent urban planning in Southeast Asia has incorporated the theme of transforming cities to ‘smart city’ status. However, the central question raised in this study is whether the ASEAN’s conception of smart cities is genuinely sustainable. Based on the backdrop of Southeast Asia’s disparity in economic performances and diversity in its political, social, economic, and environmental dimensions, this study updates Crumpton’s 2021 study on the ‘quintuple helix model’ and argues that new observations but old patterns are found in the ASEAN Smart Cities Network’s way of developing cities in Southeast Asia. Utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods and considering data among the ten ASEAN member states in the past four years, this study revisits and updates the current state of Southeast Asia and how this corresponds to the challenges of constructing smart cities in democratic, semi-authoritarian, and authoritarian settings.

                Introduction Tobacco consumption is a leading public health concern in Latin America, contributing significantly to mortality and economic burdens. Despite national regulations, tobacco use remains prevalent in Ecuador, particularly among certain populations. The Galapagos Archipelago provides a unique setting to assess tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among its residents. Objective This study aimed to determine tobacco consumption prevalence and evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco use and its alternatives in the resident population of the Galapagos Islands. Methods A descriptive study was conducted using validated instruments, the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) and the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). Surveys were administered between March and June 2023 to a sample of adults and teenagers, with data collected anonymously. Results A total of 436 participants were surveyed. Among adults (n=222), 25.2% were smokers, predominantly male (60.7%). In the teenage group (n=214), 6.1% reported current smoking. Smoking initiation occurred at a mean age of 17 years in adults and 15 years in teenagers. Most smokers recognized the health risks associated with tobacco, but awareness of specific diseases varied. Although 57.9% of adult smokers attempted to quit, few received professional assistance. Public support for smoke-free policies was high, yet smoking in restricted areas remained common. Conclusion Tobacco consumption in the Galapagos Archipelago is higher than the national average, especially among adults. Despite awareness of health risks, cessation efforts remain insufficient. Strengthened public health policies and targeted interventions are needed to reduce tobacco use and mitigate its health and environmental impact.

                Abstract* Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted dermatological diagnosis has become increasingly important due to its ability to support clinical decision-making and reduce diagnostic variability among specialists. This paper presents DERMOSAN, an interactive software tool developed in Streamlit, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed for the automatic classification of dermatological diseases using clinical images. Methods A public Kaggle dataset with 27,153 dermatological images distributed across ten clinical categories was used. The model was built on the ResNet152 architecture with transfer learning, implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The images were divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) subsets, applying class weighting to mitigate data imbalance. The tool integrates a Streamlit-based graphical interface that enables real-time image upload, local processing, and probabilistic diagnosis visualization. Results The model achieved 95% accuracy in training, 83% in validation, and 92.3% in testing. The confusion matrix showed better performance in the most representative classes. The developed interface allows for automatic diagnosis along with confidence scores and complementary clinical suggestions, facilitating quick and reproducible visual interpretation. Conclusions DERMOSAN is a stage of software development aimed at integrating deep learning models into accessible clinical environments. Although the system does not include clinical validation, it represents a step toward the creation of reproducible, open-source tools for AI-assisted diagnosis.

                Background This study aims to develop a short version of the wealth portfolio index by incorporating expenditure data, addressing the need for practical socioeconomic assessment tools in flood-prone regions of Indonesia. We followed the line of the national socioeconomic survey, which included comprehensive data on food and non-food expenditures, household assets, and housing characteristics. Method To construct and validate the short-form measure, a random sample of residents (N=700) was collected from flood-prone areas in Bima, Manado, and Pontianak. The study employed nonlinear principal components analysis in the form of categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA), which is suitable for integrating variables measured on differing scales. Results The CATPCA analysis supports a two-dimensional wealth portfolio index consisting of total 24 items, reflecting both asset ownership and expenditure patterns relevant to the target population. Discussion The emergence of two distinct dimensions highlights the multidimensional nature of socioeconomic status in environments with recurrent flooding. Based on the current finding, we suggest to use the short-form index which provides robust item coverage while facilitating efficient household-level assessments in diverse Indonesian communities, especially in flood-prone areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1480/v1?src=rss">Do hotel green practices influence customer satisfaction? Evidence from the Indian hospitality sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study investigates the impact of Hotel Green Practices (HGP) on customers’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the sustainable initiative, Customer Loyalty (CL), and Customer Satisfaction (CS) in the hotel industry. Although green practices have gained considerable importance in hotel operations, empirical studies that simultaneously assess their direct and mediated effects on customer satisfaction remain limited. To address this gap, the present research integrates HGP, WTP, CL, and CS into a unified structural framework and examines the mediating roles of WTP and CL in explaining consumers’ satisfaction with hotel green practices. Methods Data were collected from the guests who stayed in star rated hotels of Delhi, India, between 9th to 29th October 2025. Convenience sampling was used, and a self-administered questionnaire served as the data collection tool. Measurement items were adapted from well-established scales in hospitality and consumer behaviour research. Data were analysed using SmartPLS 4, and PLS-SEM was employed to examine the structural relationships, as well as the explanatory and predictive capabilities of the proposed model. Results The structural analysis demonstrated that HGP has a significant impact on both WTP and CL. A direct, although weaker, positive association was also observed between HGP and CS. Both mediators WTP, and CL contributed significantly to CS, with CL has the strongest effect, followed by WTP. Mediation analysis confirmed partial mediation, with indirect effects surpassing the direct effect of HGP on CS. The model showed substantial explanatory power, particularly for CS (R2 = 0.627), and demonstrated strong predictive relevance, with Q2 values exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.35. Conclusions The findings suggest that HGP has positive impact on CS, CL, and customers’ WTP. Furthermore, customer loyalty emerged as a strong mediating variable between hotel green practices and customer satisfaction relationship. Overall, these results highlight the importance of adopting sustainability practices in hotel operations, as they not only strengthen customer loyalty and customer satisfaction, but also influence customers to pay premium price for the hotel’s sustainable initiatives.

     alt="Modulation of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Levels of Glutamate and GABA by Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression"/>
<p>Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that lower baseline glutamate predicts antidepressant response to ketamine and that responders exhibit greater post-treatment increases in brain glutamate compared to non-responders. These findings suggest that glutamatergic capacity for change may underlie ketamine's therapeutic effects in treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ketamine has emerged as a highly effective intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Though it acts as a non-competitive antagonist of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), widely expressed in the brain, including on inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic cells, the mechanisms of its antidepressant action are less clear. To investigate the links between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and the clinical benefits of ketamine, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to measure both glutamate and GABA levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in 60 participants with TRD before (~within 1 week), and 24 h after a 40-min intravenous infusion with 0.5 mg/kg of racemic (<i>R,S</i>)-ketamine. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS<sub>17</sub>) was used as the primary measure of clinical improvement, and a 50% or greater improvement in HDRS<sub>17</sub> ratings was used to define treatment responders. Ketamine increased mean dACC glutamate levels in responders only 24 h after treatment (<i>n</i> = 25, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Further, lower glutamate levels at baseline predicted greater improvements in HDRS<sub>17</sub> scores at 24 h post treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). However, GABA levels remained stable after treatment irrespective of response status (<i>p</i> = 0.90). Metabolites associated with neuronal integrity (tNAA), metabolic function (tCr), and membrane turnover (tCho), which may serve as complementary biological evidence of ketamine-induced plasticity, also increased with treatment (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Results provide evidence of sustained enhancements of neurotransmission or other glutamate-related metabolic effects following subanesthetic ketamine in responders and a potential role of ACC glutamate levels as a biomarker of responsivity to ketamine.</p>

                Background The study of theory for analytic univalent and multivalent functions is an old subject in mathematics, particularly in complex analysis, that has captivated a great deal of scholars owing to the sheer sophistication of its geometrical features as well as its many research possibilities. The study of univalent functions is one of many significant elements of complex analysis for both single and multiple variables. Investigators have become keen on the conventional investigation of this topic since at least 1907. Numerous scholars in the area of complex analysis have emerged since then, including Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Cauchy, and other people. Geometric function theory combines geometry and analysis. Methods This study employs the differential subordination technique to derive multiple characteristics from the new linear operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) . The concept of the differential subordination subclass of analytical univalent functions is analyzed. Results In this section, We studied some results on differential subordination and superordination using a specific class of univalent functions stated on a specific space of univalent functions stated on the open unit disc. Using properties of the operator, we discovered a number of properties of superordinations and subordinations related to the idea of the Hadamard product. We investigated several aspects of superordinations and subordinations using a new operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) . Conclusions A new operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) : Λ ⟶ Λ has been established in this paper connected to the Dziok-Srivastava operator T σ n and the Hadamard product corresponding to the Komatu integral operator Ω μ ς . The difference operator M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) can have specific properties derived by applying the differential subordination technique. And the objective of this paper is to make use of the connection ( β 1 μ + 1 ) M σ , μ n + 1 , ς ϒ ( s ) = w ( M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) ) ′ + β 1 μ ( M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) ) .

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1478/v1?src=rss">Assessing nonlinearities in the GFP random mutagenesis landscape using the Power Transform [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Epistasis, a non-additive contribution of mutations to fitness, complicates genotype-to-phenotype prediction and is often confounded by nonlinearities in phenotype measurements. The Power Transform method, particularly Box-Cox, has been used to reduce epistasis in small, combinatorially complete datasets by linearizing phenotypic scales. However, its applicability to large landscapes, especially those generated by (quasi-)random mutagenesis, remains unclear. Methods Here, we apply both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Power Transforms to the extensively characterized green fluorescent protein (GFP) fitness landscape, which contains hundreds of thousands of two- and three-dimensional combinatorially complete datasets. Results When applied to individual hypercubes, Box-Cox reduces pairwise epistasis by 19.4% on average, whereas Yeo-Johnson – despite accommodating negative values – slightly increases epistasis (by 4.45%). Moreover, in a notable fraction of hypercubes, both methods increase the magnitude of epistatic coefficients, indicating that Power Transform does not universally reduce nonlinearity at the local scale. In contrast, applying Yeo-Johnson to the largest connected component of the GFP landscape (20,872 genotypes) successfully reduces both pairwise (by 3.86%) and third-order epistasis (by 11.6%), with the majority of coefficients decreasing in magnitude. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that Power Transform can be extended to large, real-world landscapes generated by random mutagenesis, but only when applied to connected sublandscapes. Our findings highlight a critical distinction between global and local linearization and caution against assuming that Power Transform always diminishes epistasis.

                Background Choosing an optimal business location is a critical decision that can significantly impact an organization’s success. Many businesses fail because their initiators were not properly guided with informed counsels prior to the commencement. Methods This study employed stratified random sampling to collect data from a sample of 1200 business units across the southern and middle belt regions of Nigeria. Using statistical tools such as factor analysis, empirical literature review, and ordinal logistic regression, the study explores accounting perspectives from type and locational factors necessary in making impactful business decisions. These include analyzing the turnover potential of various business types and locations. Results The study found that business success and sustainability are sensitive to factors such as culture, government regulation, religion, and population density. The findings also indicate that the choice of business type—such as consumer goods, industrial goods, foodstuff, supermarkets—and their locations in rural or urban areas all have significant implications for business survival. Conclusion By integrating accounting and statistical perspectives, businesses can make more informed and strategic location decisions. These decisions can leverage the analytical advantages of understanding business types and locations, ultimately improving operational efficiency and profitability.

                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                Purpose To report the impact of front surface eccentricity (FSE) of scleral lenses (SCLs) on the visual performance of eyes exhibiting refractive surgery-induced higher-order aberrations (HOAs) Method A female teenager presented to the clinic with blurring of vision and dependency on spectacles even after undergoing Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) in both eyes (BE). Her presenting uncorrected high contrast distance visual acuity (HCDVA) was 20/60 in the right eye (RE) and 20/40 in the left eye (LE). On examination, the cornea showed a ring-shaped area of ablation with faint scarring and a well-apposed lenticule-extraction site. Subjective refraction improved the HCDVA to 20/20p in RE and 20/25 in LE but the patient was not satisfied with the quality of vision. Ocular aberrometry revealed an increase in total HOAs as the underlying cause of unsatisfactory vision. Result A contact lens trial was recommended for BE to enhance visual quality. Rigid corneal lenses (RCLs) were tried, but the patient was intolerant to them. Large diameter SCLs of different FSEs (0, 0.6, and 0.8) were tried to reduce these aberrations. SCL with FSE 0 yielded the most favourable visual outcome. Conclusion With this case report, we hypothesize that the eccentricity of SCL can be selected according to the asphericity (at 6 mm) of the posterior corneal surface. This case also re-emphasizes the impact of SCL with varying FSEs on reducing HOAs and enhancing visual quality in eyes where conventional RCLs yield suboptimal results.

                Background Research comparing inclusive education implementation in non-Western contexts, such as Indonesia and Oman, remains limited. Both countries share cultural similarities yet differ significantly in their education governance. Understanding these differences is crucial for improving inclusive education policies and practices. Methods This study employed qualitative document analysis, reviewing 33 policy and implementation documents from Indonesia and Oman. The analysis focused on five dimensions: service models, teacher training, curriculum adaptation, community involvement, and cultural attitudes. Results and Conclusions Findings reveal that Oman’s centralized system provides consistent policy coordination but limits community participation and school flexibility. Indonesia’s decentralized system allows greater local innovation and community involvement but leads to disparities in implementation quality. Both countries struggle with teacher training, curriculum adaptation, and cultural stigma against disabilities. Effective inclusive education requires a balanced approach combining adaptive centralization and equitable decentralization, ongoing teacher development, flexible curricula, active community engagement, and cultural transformation. These insights offer practical recommendations to strengthen inclusive education in diverse socio-political contexts.

                Background Chronic arsenic exposure interferes with hippocampal-dependent cognition through glutamate excitotoxicity, which in turn interferes with the regulation of receptors and transporters. Bromelain, a combination of proteolytic enzymes derived from Ananas comosus, is known to have neuroprotective effects; however, the mechanisms by which it counteracts glutamate-mediated toxicity in the brain are poorly understood. This study investigated the potential of bromelain to normalize glutamatergic homeostasis and cognitive function in arsenic-treated rats by specifically examining the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and glutamate transporters GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Methods Seventy-two adult male Wistar rats (200-220 g) were randomly divided into nine groups (n=8 each): control, arsenic-only (20 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite, administered via oral gavage for 14 days), bromelain-only (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), arsenic plus bromelain (at the same doses), and arsenic plus donepezil (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal). Sodium arsenite (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered for 14 days to induce neurotoxicity, followed by bromelain (5–15 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or donepezil (2 mg/kg/day) for an additional 14 days (post-exposure) treatment. Glutamate concentration was measured using sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA] and total RNA was isolated to perform RT-qPCR to evaluate the expression of NR2A, GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Results Arsenic exposure impaired spatial memory, increased brain tissue glutamate, and reduced NR2A and transporter gene expression. Post-exposure bromelain treatment partially/fully normalized these outcomes, with the most consistent effects at 10 mg/kg. Findings are based on mRNA expression and tissue glutamate. Conclusions Bromelain provides multi-target neuroprotection in arsenic neurotoxicity, rescuing glutamatergic homeostasis by coordinated upregulation of NMDA receptor NR2A and the transport network (GLT-1, EAAC1, xCT), accompanied by spatial learning and memory improvement. The demonstrated dose-response, showed numerically greater effects over 15 mg/kg donepezil, although direct superiority comparisons were not pre-specified. Also, the lack of overt adverse effects support its translational potential as a safe, plant-based adjunct to excitotoxic diseases and toxin-exposed populations.

                Background The global age-standardised suicide rate is estimated at 8.9/100 000, while South Africa is at 23.5/100 000. The prehospital Emergency Medical Services is located within this burden of health. Emergency Care providers have a duty to assess, treat and transport healthcare consumers with suicidality, when attending to the suicide caseload. The aim was to appraise suicidality case frequency and typology and estimate the scope of the challenge faced by a jurisdictional emergency medical service and its care providers. Methods Using a retrospective cross-sectional design and a novel data collection instrument, a census of three years of Ambulance Incident Management Records was undertaken in a rural district of the Western Cape, South Africa. Results Of 413,712 records, 2,976 (N) mental health-related incidents were sampled. Fourteen percent (n = 412) were assessed to have descriptors of suicidal ideation (n = 227), attempted suicide (n = 83) or death by suicide (n = 102). There were, on average, 2.8 deaths by suicide per month over the 3-year study period in the Garden Route District. Women were reported to mostly ingest poison and overdose on medication, while men used strangulation and were 5 times more likely to die by suicide than women. Conclusion This study estimates the prehospital suicide and suicidality burden for the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services, elucidating an under-researched health concern within the South African prehospital space. Further study is required on the risk of emergency care provider stigmatisation towards suicide and suicidality cases, while auditing the need to assess policy, praxis, medical surveillance, EC provider clinical capacity and victim needs and experiences. Suicidality and suicide in Southern Africa could require a ‘Syndemic’ approach for the emergency service to interrupt suicidality and advance professional relevance.

                Background Pulmonary infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus are a global health concern. In the lungs, A. fumigatus employs a variety of virulence and adaptation mechanisms that allows it to survive and evade local immune responses. A. fumigatus protein kinases co-ordinately regulate adaptation to the lung environment and antifungal agents. However, to improve our understanding of the role of these fungal protein kinases in subverting the antifungal responses exhibited by specific host cells, in vitro infection models should be developed. Here, we describe a functional genomics approach to evaluate the role of A. fumigatus protein kinases upon infection of airway epithelial cells, leveraging the use of our existing library of A. fumigatus deletion mutants for kinase functions and bar-seq. Methods We infected A549 alveolar epithelial cells with a pool of 111 A. fumigatus barcoded null mutant strains in genes encoding protein kinases and used bar-seq to identify which of these are involved in fungal survival upon A549 infection. To assess the optimal method for understanding host-pathogen interactions, three approaches aimed at removing extracellular conidia were evaluated: pharmacological treatment with the antifungal nystatin, washes of unbound conidia, and differential fluorescent staining of extracellular and intracellular conidia followed by cell sorting. The identified candidates were further validated using targeted approaches. Results Our data revealed new roles for A. fumigatus protein kinases during infection of airway epithelial cells. Modification of the experimental setup allowed us to differentiate between the genes associated with uptake and those required to withstand other stresses imposed by exposure to mammalian cells. Conclusions This protocol provides a new platform to ascribe pathogenicity-associated functions to A. fumigatus genes and allows prioritization for downstream experiments in mice, potentially reducing the number of studies needed in live animals. This is particularly pertinent, as genome-wide barcoded collections with thousands of strains have become available.

                Background Virus mutants are commonly used for studying the role of individual viral proteins in infections and are increasingly investigated with functional genomics experiments of infected cells that use sequencing-based assays such as RNA-seq or ATAC-seq. However, existing mutant virus strains are often poorly documented, in particular if they have been created decades ago. Identifying viral variants directly in the functional genomics experiments avoids additional genome sequencing and allows confirming the presence of specific mutations directly in the experiment of interest. Methods We present a pipeline to directly identify mutations in viral genomes from sequencing-based functional genomics data. The pipeline combines existing SNP callers with novel methods for identifying deletions, insertions, and corresponding inserted sequences. These novel methods address the problem that existing structural variant callers performed poorly on functional genomics data with large variations in read coverage. Results We evaluated the pipeline on RNA-seq data for infection with knockout mutants for important proteins of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Comparison of the variants identified by our pipeline with the descriptions of the original publications showed that we could correctly recover the introduced mutations. Conclusions Our pipeline offers researchers a fast and easy way to identify variants in the viral genome without additional genome sequencing. The pipeline is implemented as a workflow for the workflow management system Watchdog and is available at https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-workflows/ (workflow VariantCallerPipeline).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for dementia, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous research demonstrated that a single severe TBI in wild-type (WT) mice induces a prion-like form of tau (tau<sup>TBI</sup>) that spreads throughout the brain, leading to memory deficits. Here, we investigated whether similar self-propagating tau<sup>TBI</sup> conformers are generated in humans after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We biochemically assessed tau and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels in human brain contusions surgically removed acutely after severe TBI. Inoculation studies were performed using human TBI brain homogenates in WT and tau knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of endogenous tau in tau<sup>TBI</sup> propagation. Cognitive function was evaluated using the novel object recognition test, the radial arm water maze, and the Y-maze. Pathological changes in the brain of the inoculated mice were analyzed by histological and biochemical analyses, and targeted transcriptomics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inoculation of human TBI brain homogenates in WT mice caused widespread tau deposition and cognitive impairment, hippocampal synaptic loss, and disease-associated transcriptomic changes. Effects were similar upon secondary inoculation in WT but not tau KO mice, confirming a tau-dependent mechanism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Severe TBI induces transmissible tau<sup>TBI</sup> conformers in humans acutely after injury, potentially exacerbating post-traumatic pathology, and increasing the risk for dementia later in life. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>This study investigated the anatomical structure of spinal cord segments and their association with vertebrae in Korean water deer and Siberian roe deer. Morphometric analyses revealed that the direction of spinal segmental shifts changes around the cervical and lumbar enlargements, indicating that reduced growth at these enlargements determines the segmental positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebrae.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The length of the spinal cord differs from that of the vertebral column in vertebrates, and their segmental positional relationship exhibits significant variability and complexity. However, research on the spinal cord structure of the Korean water deer and Siberian roe deer remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the anatomical structure of spinal cord segments and their association with vertebrae in these species, as well as to compare the findings with those from previously studied species. Morphometric analyses of the spinal cords and vertebrae were conducted using various measurement parameters. Notably, the cervical enlargement extended from C6 to T1, and the lumbar enlargement from L4 to S1, with significant decreases in spinal segment length observed in these regions. Transitions were noted around these enlargements, including shifts from caudal to cranial in spinal segments relative to vertebral segments and from acute to more obtuse trapezoidal shapes in dorsal rootlets. We propose that reduced growth rates at enlargements determine the positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebrae. Since this study provides the first anatomical characterization of the spinal cord in these two deer species, our findings advance our understanding of spinal cord structure in Cervidae. Furthermore, through comparative analysis with previous studies, these findings elucidate the segmental positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebral column, providing a foundation for further morphological and embryological studies across various species.</p>

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (11%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Two isolates (16.7%) one each of A.flavus and A. fumigatus, respectively , tested positive for the resistance gene cyp51a. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106658">Coordinated spinal locomotor network dynamics emerge from cell-type-specific connectivity patterns</a></h4>

              
                Even without detailed instruction from the brain, spinal locomotor circuitry generates coordinated behavior characterized by left–right alternation, segment-to-segment propagation, and variable-speed control. While existing models have emphasized the contributions of cellular- and network-level properties, the core mechanisms underlying rhythmogenesis remain incompletely understood. Further, neither family of models has fully accounted for recent experimental results in zebrafish and other organisms pointing to the importance of cell-type-specific intersegmental connectivity patterns and recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations of interneurons. Informed by these experimental findings and others, we developed a hierarchy of increasingly detailed models of the locomotor network. We find that coordinated locomotion emerges in an inhibition-dominated network in which connectivity is determined by intersegmental phase relationships among interneurons and variable-speed control is implemented by recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations. Further, while structured excitatory connections are not necessary for rhythmogenesis, they are useful for increasing peak locomotion frequency, albeit at the cost of smooth transitions at intermediate frequencies, suggesting a basic computational trade-off between speed and control. Together, this family of models shows that network-level interactions are sufficient to generate coordinated, variable-speed locomotion, providing new interpretations of intersegmental excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, as well as the basic, recruitment-based mechanism of speed control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108049">Decision-making components and times revealed by the single-trial electroencephalogram</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making stems from a sequence of information processing steps between the onset of the stimulus and the response. Despite extensive research, uncertainty remains about the actual cognitive sequence involved that leads to the reaction time. Using the hidden multivariate pattern method, we modeled the single-trial electroencephalogram of participants performing a decision task as a sequence of an unknown number of events estimated as trial-recurrent, time-varying, stable topographies. We provide evidence for five events occurring during participants’ decision-making with two visual encoding events and three events capturing respectively attention orientation, decision, and motor execution. This interpretation is supported by the observation that a targeted manipulation of stimulus intensity yields Piéron’s law in the interval between encoding and attention orientation, and Fechner’s law in the interval between attention orientation and decision commitment. The final decision-related event is represented in the brain as a ramping signal in parietal areas whose timing, amplitude, and build-up predict the participants’ decision accuracy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107765">The evolution of interdisciplinarity and internationalization in scientific journals</a></h4>

              
                There is a widely held perception that science is becoming more international—through multi-national collaborations—and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96987">JAK-STAT pathway activation compromises nephrocyte function in a Drosophila high-fat diet model of chronic kidney disease</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease is a major health issue and is gaining prevalence. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model for chronic kidney disease, we show that a high-fat diet (HFD) disrupts the slit diaphragm filtration structure in nephrocytes, the fly functional equivalent of mammalian podocytes. The structural disruption resulted in reduced filtration function in the affected nephrocytes. We demonstrate that HFD activates the JAK-STAT pathway in nephrocytes, which has previously been linked to diabetic kidney disease. JAK-STAT activation was initiated by increased expression and release of the adipokine, Upd2, from the fat body. This leptin-like hormone is a known ligand of JAK-STAT. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of JAK-STAT restored nephrocyte HFD-associated dysfunction. Altogether, our study reveals the importance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the adipose tissue−nephrocyte axis and its contribution to HFD-associated nephropathy. These findings open new avenues for intervention in treating diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107758">Neisseria gonorrhoeae LIN codes provide a robust, multi-resolution lineage nomenclature</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of the bacterial pathogen <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is complicated by extensive horizontal gene transfer: a process which disrupts phylogenetic signals and impedes our understanding of population structure. The ability to consistently identify <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, conventional typing systems fail to reflect <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate’s ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance. These codes are automatically assigned and publicly accessible via the <a href="https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp">https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp</a> database.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90849">Hybridization breaks species barriers in long-term coevolution of a cyanobacterial population</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial species often undergo rampant recombination yet maintain cohesive genomic identity. Ecological differences can generate recombination barriers between species and sustain genomic clusters in the short term. But can these forces prevent genomic mixing during long-term coevolution? Cyanobacteria in Yellowstone hot springs comprise several diverse species that have coevolved for hundreds of thousands of years, providing a rare natural experiment. By analyzing more than 300 single-cell genomes, we show that despite each species forming a distinct genomic cluster, much of the diversity within species is the result of hybridization driven by selection, which has mixed their ancestral genotypes. This widespread mixing is contrary to the prevailing view that ecological barriers can maintain cohesive bacterial species and highlights the importance of hybridization as a source of genomic diversity.

">Stable fusion of bone marrow-derived cells with Purkinje neurons enables long-term nuclear integration and neuronal repair</a></h4>

              
                Developing effective strategies to replace or restore injured neurons could significantly revolutionise the treatment of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can migrate into the brain and fuse with damaged Purkinje neurons (PNs), restoring their structure and function. Yet, despite over two decades of research, the temporal dynamics and functional stability of these fusion events in vivo remain poorly defined, largely due to reliance on static, post-mortem histological analyses that provide only a single snapshot in time. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus. Given their accessibility and genetic tractability, BMDCs represent a practical and promising platform for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to PNs, opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative disease.

">Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) induce dose-dependent neonatal ventriculomegaly following intracerebroventricular administration</a></h4>

              
                Cell-type-speci[fi]c expression of synthetic/endogenous proteins or genetic sequences has signi[fi]cantly advanced our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery to cerebrospinal [fl]uid (CSF) mediates transfection of target cells to enable sustained delivery of secretory proteins into the CSF, o[ff]ering promising avenues for both CNS therapy and mechanistic studies. However, despite the advantages afforded by AAV tropism-based cellular selectivity and transgene delivery, both preclinical studies and clinical trials report short- and long-term adverse e[ff]ects, particularly immune activation. Especially relevant for CSF biology, CNS immune insults raise the risk of CSF dysregulation, including hydrocephalus. These risks may be exacerbated in pediatric populations, where ongoing CNS development, including immature meninges, choroid plexus (ChP), and skull structures, may further impair any ability to compensate for CSF dysregulation. To systematically address these risks and provide guidelines for minimizing CNS immune insults by AAVs, we test the dose-dependent e[ff]ects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 3 AAV serotypes (AAV2/5, AAV2/4, and AAV.PHP.eB) to neonatal (P0.5) CD1 mouse pups. Histological analysis veri[fi]ed AAV2/5 tropism limited to ChP epithelial cells (CPECs), whereas AAV.PHP.eB transfected both CPECs and ependymal regions. By contrast, AAV2/4 shows limited transfection in the brain. Further, we [fi]nd that ICV injections of all 3 AAV serotypes at the high dose (4x109 genome copy GC/pup) induced ventriculomegaly by P7.5, while the low dose (1x109 GC/pup) was well tolerated. Additionally, high-dose AAV2/5 tropism became more permissive, transfecting the ChP and also ependymal cells and some neurons. Longitudinal MRI of P0.5 pups with high-dose AAV2/5 ICV injections highlighted quick progression of ventriculomegaly. CSF ELISA analysis detected elevated proin[fl]ammatory cytokine CCL2 in AAV2/5 and AAV2/4 high-dose groups, indicating CNS inflammation. Moreover, decreased CSF TTR concentrations in high-dose groups suggest ChP dysfunction. We further revealed that earlier in utero high-dose ICV AAV2/5 injections at E13.5 induced even more severe ventriculomegaly and that adult animals were also susceptible to ventriculomegaly after high-dose AAV ICV delivery. Taken together, our data emphasize critical safety considerations of CSF-based AAV delivery, particularly during brain development. Further, these results call for an optimized dosage for perinatal ICV AAV applications.

">Volume Electron Microscopy of Cortical Organoids: Methods for Region Identification, Connectome Reconstruction, and Organelle Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has become a powerful tool for 3D ultrastructural analysis of neural circuits, yet its application to human brain organoids remains limited, particularly for connectomic studies. Here, we established a comprehensive and scalable workflow for applying vEM to human cortical organoids, integrating correlative light and electron microscopy, large-area SEM mosaic imaging, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validation. By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.

">Distinct neural processing of real versus unreal optic flow in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception of self-movement relies on optic flow, a global motion pattern generated by self-movement in a rigid 3D environment. Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as "real" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such "unreal" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.

">Fast and slow architectures of cortical dynamics in human brain</a></h4>

              
                The most critical attribute of the brain is its ability to coordinate perception, thoughts, and action across different timescales. A prominent theory holds that the cortex is organized along a unidimensional hierarchy, where higher-order regions operate over longer intrinsic timescales than sensory areas, a view inferred from analytical methods that assume a single, dominant timescale per region. However, whether cortical dynamics are governed by such a singular hierarchy, or instead by multiple concurrent timescales, has remained unclear due to this fundamental methodological constraint. Here, developing an assumption-free spectral analysis of human intracranial recordings, we discover a fundamental dissociation: cortical dynamics are organized into a fast spectral component (~10-100 Hz) and a slow component (<~1-10 Hz). Crucially, only the fast component spatially recapitulates the classic sensory-to-transmodal functional gradient, whereas the slow component lacks gradient and is coupled to cardiac-related neural activity. This dual-timescale architecture, stable across distinct conscious states, demonstrates human cortical dynamics are organized into parallel processing channels, not a single temporal hierarchy. This framework provides a new foundation for understanding dynamical subsystems that link to brain physiology and cognition.

">Ciliary sensing in tanycytes couples nutrient availability to metabolic regulation</a></h4>

              
                Body homeostasis relies on accurate communication between the brain and the periphery. Disruption of this communication can contribute to disease. Tanycytes are located at the interface of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bloodstream, and hypothalamus, where they sense circulating nutrients and regulate neuroendocrine axes and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which they sense CSF signals remain largely unclear. Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice. These findings identify tanycytic cilia as key sensors regulating energy balance.

">Discovery of Abundant Nano-scale Lymphatic-like Vessels in Brains</a></h4>

              
                As one of the most metabolically active organs, the high metabolic demands of the brain require a highly efficient system for waste clearance. However, it remains unclear whether the brain possesses such an efficient system, and if so, what are the features of the system. Over a decade ago, a glymphatic system was proposed to describe neurofluid transport through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perivascular spaces (PVS), complemented by dural and meningeal lymphatic pathways. Nonetheless, it is still elusive whether transport within the CSF and PVS occurs as a structured form of flow. Moreover, unlike the abundance of blood capillaries in the brain, only a low density of lymphatic vessels has been observed. Such a low density of lymphatic vessels is unlikely to support the level of efficiency required for effective metabolic waste clearance in the brain. By combining expansion microscopic imaging with CRANAD-3, a pan-beta-amyloid fluorescence probe, we discovered abundant nano-scale lymphatic-like vessels (NLVs) in the brain parenchyma of both mouse and human. The majority of these vessels have diameters less than 1000 nanometers and show moderate positivity for several lymphatic biomarkers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, PDPN, and VEGFR3. The NLVs coil around blood vessels and possible connections between blood vessels were observed. Notably, we also found that some NLVs travel through several layers in the cortex and display distinct orientation patterns in different cortical layers. Our discovery reveals a previously hidden vascular system, and raises the possibility that such an abundant and structured web of tubular structures could enable highly efficient means to enhance waste clearance, and could thus play a crucial role in supporting the high metabolic demands of brains.

">Memory schema reorganization induced by the deliberate processing in the executive network supported by widespread amplified activity</a></h4>

              
                Schema accommodation is the reorganization of a preexisting memory schema to deeply accept new information incongruent with it. Although it is crucial for flexible intelligence, it occurs infrequently, making its neural basis difficult to study. To overcome this, we conducted an fMRI experiment using a newly developed experimental paradigm, the reversal description task. The results suggest that the schema changes that occurred during the task were global reorganizations rather than local adjustments. Moreover, the executive network responsible for deliberate processing played a central role, with the support of widespread amplified activity. Furthermore, reinforcement learning-based control implemented in these neural substrates, in cooperation with the caudate nucleus, emerged as a candidate mechanism for the deliberative schema update. These findings indicate that memory reorganization involves not only automatic but also deliberate processes, in which the desired global structure is explored through the control operation performed by these neural bases.

">Expression of the human immunomodulatory protein, human B7-1 (CD80), accelerates neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, microvascular instability and lethality in a murine model of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immune loci exhibit significant sequence diversity, with human proteins sharing only 45% to 70% identity with their murine orthologs. This divergence contributes to the inability of many established mouse models to accurately capture key neuroinflammatory mechanisms relevant to human AD. We recently identified that the human, but not murine, immunomodulatory protein B71 (CD80) activates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), a function arising from evolutionary divergence in human B71. This discovery provides an opportunity to directly interrogate the role of this interaction in disease progression using a well-characterized murine model of mutant A{beta} overexpression (CRND8). We generated a mouse line in which murine B71 was replaced with a chimeric human:murine B71 that retains normal interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28, while gaining the ability to bind p75, and evaluated its effects in CRND8 mice. Expression of human:murine B71 in vivo resulted in increased lethality, accelerated neuroinflammation of resident glia, more rapid synaptic and dendritic loss, and enhanced microvascular compromise in the subiculum compared to CRND8 mice expressing murine B71. Together, these findings identify the human B71:p75 interaction as a previously unrecognized contributor to AD pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target in a brain region critical for learning and memory that is affected in early stages of disease.

">Aberrant medial entorhinal cortex dynamics link tau pathology to spatial memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests spatial memory impairment and tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, how EC neural activity contributes to memory deficits in tauopathy remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with virtual reality to examine medial EC (MEC) activity in PS19 tauopathy mice during 10 days of spatial learning. PS19 males exhibited pronounced learning deficits and their MEC neurons showed impaired speed modulation, unstable spatial encoding, and weakened representations in cue-poor relative to cue-rich regions, suggesting disrupted path integration. These deficits were most prominent in pyramidal cells, which accumulated higher levels of phosphorylated tau than stellate cells, particularly in males. Notably, MEC activity robustly predicted learning performance, especially via non-grid and pyramidal cells, and distinguished PS19 from wild-type mice. Together, these findings identify MEC dysfunction as a key neural correlate of spatial memory decline in AD-related tauopathy, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

">Postmortem brain MRI reveals differential associations of subcortical and limbic volumes with cortical thinning and neuropathology patterns</a></h4>

              
                The impact of different neuropathologies on deep brain structures remains to be understood. In this study, we investigate subcortical and limbic volumetry in neurodegenerative diseases involving concomitant co-pathologies (p-tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43). We acquired neuropathological measures and brain segmentations from ex vivo postmortem analysis of 132 donors with Alzheimer disease (AD; n=60), Lewy body disease (LBD; n=26), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP; n=21) and FTLD-Tau (n=25). Compared with AD and LBD, individuals with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau exhibited significantly reduced thalamic and striatal volumes. Disease-specific cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic associations were observed: AD showed widespread cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic morphometric associations, whereas LBD demonstrated more restricted parieto-occipital cortical-limbic associations. FTLD-TDP was characterized by predominant cortico-subcortical associations, while FTLD-Tau showed stronger cortico-limbic coupling. Pathology/structure analyses revealed that in AD and FTLD-Tau, hippocampal volume was associated with p-tau burden, neuronal loss, and gliosis. In LBD, thalamic alpha-synuclein severity was associated with both subcortical and limbic volumes, whereas no significant volumetric associations with TDP-43 burden were detected in FTLD-TDP. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct structure-structure and structure-pathology relationships across neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the value of ex vivo postmortem neuroimaging for disentangling disease-specific patterns of deep brain vulnerability.

">Rescuing Neurodevelopmental Deficits in AMPA Receptor Gain-of-Function Mutant</a></h4>

              
                AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for neuronal development and brain function. We investigated the role of a recurrent variant in the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T) identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). To test causality and mechanism, we generated a Gria1-A636T knock-in mouse model. Mutant mice exhibited core ASD/ID-like behaviors and a selective hippocampal vulnerability characterized by progressive dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss. Despite reduced GluA1-containing complexes, AMPARs displayed synaptic hyperexcitability and failed to undergo the normal postnatal transition to calcium-impermeable AMPARs, resulting in persistent excitotoxicity. To explore therapeutic intervention, we designed an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide to specifically silence the mutant transcript. A single neonatal administration of the antisense oligonucleotide entirely prevented hippocampal pathology and ameliorated behavioral deficits. These findings establish GRIA1-A636T as a gain-of-function mutation that drives developmental excitotoxicity and highlight the potential of RNA-targeted precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Symmetry constraints on feedback-driven orientation tuning dynamics in translation-invariant models of primate V1</a></h4>

              
                Orientation selectivity in primate V1 is shaped by feedforward drive, intracortical recurrence, and corticocortical feedback. Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.

">Cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of cervical vagus vs. auricular nerve: a comparative, parametric study in nonhuman primates</a></h4>

              
                Stimulation of sensory vagal pathways is typically delivered via invasive, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) or noninvasive, trans-auricular nerve stimulation (taNS). While both methods are investigated therapeutically, their effects on brain physiology remain poorly understood, hindering mechanistic understanding and stimulus optimization. In 6 awake nonhuman primates, we recorded cortical vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs) from subdural electrodes placed in prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas, in response to cVNS or taNS. Across 478 different taNS and cVNS protocols, we varied stimulation side, intensity, frequency, pulse count, and pulse width (PW) and assessed independent effects on amplitude and latency of early (EC; 30-100 ms), intermediate (IC; 101-200 ms) and late components (LC; 201-500 ms) of VEPs. Fixed and random effects of stimulation parameters and subjects, respectively, on VEP measurements, were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Overall, cVNS elicits more robust VEPs than taNS, with larger EC, IC and LC amplitudes in both hemispheres. cVNS-elicited ECs and LCs are largest in PFC and PC areas, whereas ICs are largest in SM areas. On the other hand, taNS generally does not elicit area-specific responses. cVNS-elicited ECs have slower latency than ta-NS elicited ECs. Higher stimulation frequencies and intensities and a longer pulse width elicit larger ECs and ICs for cVNS, and to some extent for taNS. Both short and long cVNS trains elicit stronger ECs, and long trains elicit slower ICs. Earlobe stimulation elicits VEPs that partially overlap with those from taNS. In conclusion, cVNS and taNS elicit cortical VEPs in a manner consistent with distinct engagement of ascending vagal pathways, and with similarities and differences in the effects of stimulation parameters on evoked responses.

                HIV-associated neurological complications remain a major concern in people living with HIV (PLWH), even under effective viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), underscoring unresolved mechanisms driving HIV-related neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we used HIV-1-infected human cerebral organoids (hCOs) containing microglia as a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of the central nervous system (CNS) and validated key findings in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, cART-treated rhesus macaque model. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with ATAC sequencing, we identified cell-type-specific alterations in dual innate immune-driven inflammatory signaling pathways across neural and glial populations. Microglia were preferentially infected and activated, initiating IL-17A-mediated cascades involving IFN{gamma}, STAT1, CEBPB, and NFkB pathways, which converged with cGAS-STING and Notch-NEURL1 signaling, both associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. cART suppressed viral replication, reduced IL-17A-driven neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, and restored synaptic gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify IL-17A, STAT1, CEBPB, and cGAS-STING as key molecular drivers of HIV-associated neuroinflammation and establish a novel mechanistic link between IL-17A signaling and microglial remodeling, providing a translational framework for the development of CNS-targeted therapies in PLWH.

">Friendship modulates physical effort and neural dynamics during group coordination in shared social networks</a></h4>

              
                Human social interactions are embedded within social networks, yet it remains unclear how existing interpersonal relationships influence the behavioural and neural dynamics of collective action. Here, we combined social network mapping with three-person EEG hyperscanning to investigate how friendships in shared networks modulate interpersonal coordination. We mapped social networks across seven undergraduate cohorts (N = 378) and recruited a subset of participants (N = 93) that consisted of triads of two mutually close friends and one non-friend from the same network. Triads performed a novel joint motor task in which participants produced forces towards a collective target. Non-friends consistently produced greater and more vigorous force than friends during joint action. This effect was strongest for non-friends embedded in smaller social networks. At the neural level, non-friends exhibited stronger alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization, higher inter-subject correlation, and increased inter-brain group phase synchrony. These neural signatures are consistent with increased action preparation, prediction, and attentional engagement during coordination. Taken together, these findings indicate that friendship and social network context are reflected in how individuals allocate physical effort and engage during collective action, and suggest that non-friends work harder and allocate more attention during joint tasks to compensate for the disparity in social standing. By linking real-world social relationships to behavioural and multi-brain neural dynamics, this work demonstrates that relational context is embodied in the mechanisms supporting human group coordination.

">Kinematic fields of the visuo-hippocampal circuit</a></h4>

              
                The structure of focused receptive fields in retinotopic and allocentric space in the visual cortex and hippocampus is studied extensively to understand cognitive functions such as stimulus tracking and path-integration, respectively. These functions require accurate tracking of running speed and acceleration. While speed dependence in these areas is well-studied, acceleration-dependence has received little attention, and the joint effect of speed-acceleration is unknown. Hence, we assessed the joint influence of these kinematic variables by computing receptive fields in a novel, 2D, phase space of speed-acceleration using the Allen Brain Visual Observatory data. Head-fixed mice ran spontaneously on a running wheel next to a monocular gray screen ensuring virtually no changes in the retinotopic or allocentric space. Remarkably, about half (44.3%, 6590/14862) of neurons in the visuo-hippocampal circuit (from LGN to subiculum) were significantly modulated by a specific combination of speed and acceleration to form receptive fields in the speed-acceleration phase space (called kinematic space). The prevalence of kinematic tuning is comparable to the fraction of place cells in the mouse hippocampus, and the fraction of visually tuned neurons in higher visual areas. The kinematic field size (~30% of the sampled space) was also comparable to the place field size. Kinematic fields spanned the entire space but preferred either low-speed, high-acceleration or the high-speed, low-acceleration segments. Although pupil size too varied spontaneously, the kinematic tuning exceeded pupil size tuning in all brain areas. Surprisingly, pupil size modulated the activity of ~20% of hippocampal neurons, which was comparable to that in LGN and visual cortical areas. Thus, all visuo-hippocampal areas have focused kinematic fields that are three times more prevalent than the pupil size fields in the absence of any vestibular, visual or spatial stimuli. This kinematic phase space could interface with retinotopic and allocentric spaces to guide natural behaviors involving movement.

                Myelination in the postnatal cortex requires epigenetic programs that activate oligodendrocyte gene networks. Here we show that the histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B promotes this process in vivo. Conditional Kdm6b deletion (Kdm6b-cKO) in Emx1 dorsal telencephalic progenitors caused delayed cortical myelination. Lineage-specific RNA-seq revealed that the oligodendrocyte master regulator Sox10 was significantly reduced, as well as myelination effectors, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the same lineage showed increased H3K27me3 at promoter-proximal regions of Sox10, consistent with loss of KDM6B-mediated de-repression. Temporally controlled Sox10 induction partially rescued myelination in Kdm6b-cKO mice. These findings define a KDM6B[-&gt;]SOX10 axis that licenses oligodendrocyte development and cortical myelination by removing repressive H3K27me3 and sustaining active chromatin, with implications for KDM6B-related neurodevelopmental disorders.
