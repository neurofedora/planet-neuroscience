	<p>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) display many cognitive and physiological alterations resulting from renal failure and physical inactivity. Caffeine intake has been reported to improve cognitive/physical performance in several studies. However, whether the benefits of caffeine intake apply to patients with ESRD remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of caffeine intake on postural balance, cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD. In a randomized order, 12 patients with ESRD (age: 33.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.57 years; Female: 45.5%) performed a battery of tests after either caffeine (CF) (400 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Postural balance was evaluated using a stabilometric platform. Functional capacity was assessed with the sit-to-stand and up-and-go tests, and for cognitive performances, reaction time test and a vigilance test were used. Results showed a significant improvement in up-and-go test (p = 0.01) and sit-to-stand test performances with CF compared to PLA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Time of reaction test and vigilance test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) performances were significantly higher with CF. No significant difference was observed in postural balance between CF and PLA. The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD.</p>

                Abstract* Background The level of liver fibrosis is the basis for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and it is necessary to adapt non-invasive liver fibrosis modalities. We aimed to investigate the use of M2BPGi as a single or combined diagnostic modality for liver fibrosis in CHB patients through a stepwise diagnostic analysis. Methods Cross-sectional data were taken from patients between October 2021 and August 2022. Demographic data, blood profile, liver function, and liver stiffness were measured in CHB patients over 18 years old, willing to take part in the research, and had complete data. APRI, FIB-4, and AAR were calculated using the well-known formulas. Serum M2BPGi-levels were converted into a cut-off index (COI). The patients were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk fibrosis (HR) groups. A cut-off for each predictor variable to differentiate between the LR and HR groups was determined. The obtained cut-off was assessed for its association with the grouping of liver elastography results. Models to diagnose the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa were created and compared through multivariate and ROC analyses. Results The number of patients that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 143 (HR = 65, LR = 78). The cut-off for diagnosing LSM ≥8kPa was 0.311, 0.742, 0.635, and 1.434 for APRI, FIB-4, AAR, and M2BPGi, respectively. This cut-off was significantly associated with the results of the HR and LR groupings. A multivariate analysis found that FIB4, AAR, and M2BPGi added significantly to the model. Statistically, the most optimal use of M2BPGi was combined with FIB-4, with an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions The optimal cut-off of M2BPGi for diagnosing high-risk liver fibrosis in this study was 1.434. M2BPGi should be used with FIB-4 as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing liver fibrosis, especially in the absence of a liver biopsy or elastography.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. <i>In vitro</i> TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of <i>in vitro</i> models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.

                <p>by Pascal Grobecker, Thomas Sakoparnig, Erik van Nimwegen</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with ‘similar’ expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionality-reduction, employ <i>ad hoc</i> measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called Cellstates which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, Cellstates almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, Cellstates robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that Cellstates identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the Cellstates tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important differentially expressed genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.

                <p>by Thomas Couppey, Louis Regnacq, Roland Giraud, Olivier Romain, Yannick Bornat, Florian Kolbl</p>

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves has been used in various pathological contexts for rehabilitation purposes or to alleviate the symptoms of neuropathologies, thus improving the overall quality of life of patients. However, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is still a challenging issue requiring extensive <i>in vivo</i> experimental campaigns and technical development. To facilitate the design of new stimulation strategies, we provide a fully open source and self-contained software framework for the <i>in silico</i> evaluation of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation. Our modeling approach, developed in the popular and well-established Python language, uses an object-oriented paradigm to map the physiological and electrical context. The framework is designed to facilitate multi-scale analysis, from single fiber stimulation to whole multifascicular nerves. It also allows the simulation of complex strategies such as multiple electrode combinations and waveforms ranging from conventional biphasic pulses to more complex modulated kHz stimuli. In addition, we provide automated support for stimulation strategy optimization and handle the computational backend transparently to the user. Our framework has been extensively tested and validated with several existing results in the literature.

                <p>by Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Monja Isabel Froböse, Alfons Schnitzler, Elisabeth Schreivogel, Gerhard Jocham</p>

In everyday life, we encounter situations that require tradeoffs between potential rewards and associated costs, such as time and (physical) effort. The literature indicates a prominent role for dopamine in discounting of both delay and effort, with mixed findings for delay discounting in humans. Moreover, the reciprocal antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmission in the striatum suggests a potential opponent role of acetylcholine in these processes. We found opposing effects of dopamine D2 (haloperidol) and acetylcholine M1 receptor (biperiden) antagonism on specific components of effort-based decision-making in healthy humans: haloperidol decreased, whereas biperiden increased the willingness to exert physical effort. In contrast, delay discounting was reduced under haloperidol, but not affected by biperiden. Together, our data suggest that dopamine, acting at D2 receptors, modulates both effort and delay discounting, while acetylcholine, acting at M1 receptors, appears to exert a more specific influence on effort discounting only.

                <p>by Kirsten Bohmbach, Christian Henneberger</p>

Glial cells such as astrocytes can modulate neuronal signaling. Astrocytes can also acquire a reactive phenotype that correlates with cognitive impairments in brain diseases. A study in PLOS Biology shows that prolonged activation of astrocytes can trigger both cognitive impairments and a reactive astrocyte phenotype.

                <p>by Kun Cui, Xuetao Qi, Zilong Liu, Weiqi Sun, Peijie Jiao, Chang Liu, Jifu Tong, Xiaoyan Sun, Haojie Sun, Su Fu, Jiaxin Wang, Yawen Zheng, Tianyu Liu, Shuang Cui, Fengyu Liu, Jian Mao, Jie Zheng, You Wan, Ming Yi</p>

Over-generalized fear is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. The dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) contains engram cells that play a crucial role in accurate memory retrieval. However, the coordination mechanism of neuronal subpopulations within the dDG network during fear generalization is not well understood. Here, with the Tet-off system combined with immunostaining and two-photon calcium imaging, we report that dDG fear engram cells labeled in the conditioned context constitutes a significantly higher proportion of dDG neurons activated in a similar context where mice show generalized fear. The activation of these dDG fear engram cells encoding the conditioned context is both sufficient and necessary for inducing fear generalization in the similar context. Activities of mossy cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vMCs) are significantly suppressed in mice showing fear generalization in a similar context, and activating the vMCs-dDG pathway suppresses generalized but not conditioned fear. Finally, modifying fear memory engrams in the dDG with “safety” signals effectively rescues fear generalization. These findings reveal that the competitive advantage of dDG engram cells underlies fear generalization, which can be rescued by activating the vMCs-dDG pathway or modifying fear memory engrams, and provide novel insights into the dDG network as the neuronal basis of fear generalization.

                Background Currently there are 1.3 billion adolescents worldwide, which makes up 16% of the world population. Over 20% of adolescents around the world are thought to have behavioural or mental health issues. Addressing mental health issues is very important for the promotion of positive health in adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among adolescents in urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 adolescents aged 16 to 19 years each from urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Results Depression, anxiety and stress were found to be 23.1%, 29.4% and 26.6% in urban areas and 19.1%, 24% and 21.1% in rural areas respectively. Depression was more common among females in both urban and rural settings, with a significant difference observed in rural areas. Anxiety and stress were also more prevalent among females, with anxiety significantly higher in urban females. Urban adolescents exhibited higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their rural counterparts. Conclusions About a quarter of the adolescent population suffers from depression anxiety and stress. Adopting and implementing better education and health policies are necessary to enhance adolescent mental health.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28 % of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby’s immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

                Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the existing research on the antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior namely motivational factors and personality factors and its impact on business performance. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a systematic review methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines.. Using the SCOPUS database, the search involved Boolean operators to narrow down relevant articles published in English between 2000 and 2024. Following a meticulous screening process, 32 articles were selected for review after removing duplicates and excluding non-English articles. Methodological quality assessment ensuring focused research questions, precise subject selection methods, representative samples, and reliable measurement instruments was carried out. Findings The results demonstrate that entrepreneurs who are self-reliant and extroverted have fewer partners, however, these traits positively impact networking activities. The Big Five personality traits predict business creation and success of ventures. Desire for financial gain, risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, and the need for achievement influences networking behavior. Implications The insights given in this paper can be used for establishing valuable connections, investing in resources, and preparing effective strategies for businesses. Policymakers who aim to promote entrepreneurial behavior among experienced individuals must emphasize the motivations for starting a business and the role of personalities in harnessing and leveraging individual entrepreneurial expertise. Originality The existing literature on antecedents of entrepreneurial networking Behavior and the relationship of these antecedents together with business performance is limited. Further, this review article also offers avenues for future researchers.

                With the increase in plastic waste in the environment, it is undeniable that humans and most organisms are exposed to plastic particles of various sizes, including nanoplastics (NPs). Humans are at risk owing to various routes of entry, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. While the toxicity of NPs is still debatable due to the scarcity of resources and research, most studies have concluded that NPs may exert toxicity, which exacerbates their neurotoxicity potential. Earlier studies concluded that NPs can cause oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis of neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that NPs can affect fundamental cell functions by inducing physical stress through deposition. Furthermore, studies on in vivo models exposed to NPs have demonstrated behavioral changes that are presumably due to alterations in acetylcholinesterase activity and neurotransmitter levels. This review discusses studies conducted on the neurotoxic potential of NPs and their effects, which are dependent on several parameters, including size and type of NPs, exposure concentration, duration, and various models at risk of NP exposure. Furthermore, speculations on how NPs are related to neurotoxicity are also discussed.

                Learning new motor skills involves significant changes in the connectivity and activity of brain motor circuits. In this review, Roth and Ding discuss recent findings on motor-learning-induced neural plasticity within the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, highlighting the role of circuit adaptations and underlying synaptic plasticity mechanisms.

                Meng et al. show that 1% oxygen results in cell cycle re-entry in macrophages. Mechanistically, this is triggered by an HIF2α-directed transcriptional program and accompanied by reversible activation of the canonical MEK/ERK proliferation pathway. CDK1-associated SAMHD1 phosphorylation at T592 in hypoxic macrophages renders them more susceptible to lentiviral transduction.

                Despite the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, many patients remain unresponsive, and predictive biomarkers are needed. Xu et al. identify P2RY6 as a key driver of immune evasion in cancers, promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy, thus nominating P2RY6 as a precision immunotherapy target.

                Dai et al. show that deubiquitylase OTUD3 suppresses liver cancer’s progression and sorafenib resistance by removing the K27-linked ubiquitin chains on eIF2α, which function as a bridge to recruit EIF2AK3 and activate ISR. Combined inhibition of ISR is a promising therapeutic strategy to counter sorafenib resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95318">RBM7 deficiency promotes breast cancer metastasis by coordinating MFGE8 splicing switch and NF-kB pathway</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant alternative splicing is well-known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis driven by deregulated splicing events remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveiled that RBM7 is decreased in lymph node and distant organ metastases of breast cancer as compared to primary lesions and low expression of RBM7 is correlated with the reduced disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Breast cancer cells with RBM7 depletion exhibited an increased potential for lung metastasis compared to scramble control cells. The absence of RBM7 stimulated breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, RBM7 controlled the splicing switch of MFGE8, favoring the production of the predominant isoform of MFGE8, MFGE8-L. This resulted in the attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation and alterations in cell adhesion molecules. MFGE8-L exerted an inhibitory effect on the migratory and invasive capability of breast cancer cells, while the truncated isoform MFGE8-S, which lack the second F5/8 type C domain had the opposite effect. In addition, RBM7 negatively regulates the NF-κB cascade and an NF-κB inhibitor could obstruct the increase in HUVEC tube formation caused by RBM7 silencing. Clinically, we noticed a positive correlation between RBM7 expression and MFGE8 exon7 inclusion in breast cancer tissues, providing new mechanistic insights for molecular-targeted therapy in combating breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93194">Evolutionary adaptation of an HP1-protein chromodomain integrates chromatin and DNA sequence signals</a></h4>

              
                Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the <i>Drosophila</i> PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino’s chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> mutation phenocopy <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> flies. Thus, Rhino’s chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91931">The components of an electrical synapse as revealed by expansion microscopy of a single synaptic contact</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication, known as 'chemical' and 'electrical' synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction' (a cluster of intercellular channels) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95397">Uncovering the BIN1-SH3 interactome underpinning centronuclear myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Truncation of the protein-protein interaction SH3 domain of the membrane remodeling Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1, Amphiphysin 2) protein leads to centronuclear myopathy. Here, we assessed the impact of a set of naturally observed, previously uncharacterized BIN1 SH3 domain variants using conventional <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays monitoring the BIN1 interaction with dynamin 2 (DNM2) and identified potentially harmful ones that can be also tentatively connected to neuromuscular disorders. However, SH3 domains are typically promiscuous and it is expected that other, so far unknown partners of BIN1 exist besides DNM2, that also participate in the development of centronuclear myopathy. In order to shed light on these other relevant interaction partners and to get a holistic picture of the pathomechanism behind BIN1 SH3 domain variants, we used affinity interactomics. We identified hundreds of new BIN1 interaction partners proteome-wide, among which many appear to participate in cell division, suggesting a critical role of BIN1 in the regulation of mitosis. Finally, we show that the identified BIN1 mutations indeed cause proteome-wide affinity perturbation, signifying the importance of employing unbiased affinity interactomic approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89032">Vacuolar H+-ATPase determines daughter cell fates through asymmetric segregation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.

">Sarm1-Dependent Metabolic Reprogramming of Schwann Cells Following Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells (SCs) transition into a repair phenotype after peripheral nerve injury, which is crucial for supporting axon regeneration. However, the early SC injury response preceding the repair state remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sarm1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, is expressed in SCs and has a critical role in the early SC injury response. Leveraging the fact that Sarm1 deletion impairs the SC transition to the repair state, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional responses of wild-type and Sarm1 knockout SCs 24 hours after nerve injury. Remarkably, Sarm1-deficient SCs, unlike wild-type SCs, showed increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle. These findings were functionally validated, revealing that Sarm1 knockout SCs displayed increased mitochondrial respiration in response to injury. Intriguingly, Sarm1 knockout SCs also exhibited enhanced axon protection compared to wild-type SCs in an in vitro model of axon degeneration. We propose that Sarm1 gates the transition of SCs from a protective, oxidative phosphorylation-dependent state (which we term Protection Associated Schwann Cells or PASCs) to a glycolytic, pro-regenerative repair phenotype after injury. Our findings challenge the prevailing view of Sarm1 as an exclusively axon-autonomous regulator of degeneration and reveal a paradigm shift in understanding the role of Sarm1 in the SC injury response, with broad implications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Translatome analysis reveals cellular network in DLK-dependent hippocampal glutamatergic neuron degeneration</a></h4>

              
                The conserved MAP3K12/Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) plays versatile roles in neuronal development, axon injury and stress responses, and neurodegeneration, depending on cell-type and cellular contexts. Emerging evidence implicates abnormal DLK signaling in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of the DLK-dependent gene network in the central nervous system remains limited. Here, we investigated the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. We found that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear largely unaffected. We identified the DLK-dependent translatome that includes conserved molecular signatures and displays cell-type specificity. Increasing DLK signaling is associated with disruptions to microtubules, potentially involving STMN4. Additionally, primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressing different levels of DLK show altered neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation. The identification of translational targets of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons has relevance to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

">Oxidative stress promotes axonal atrophy through alterations in microtubules and EB1 function</a></h4>

              
                Axons are crucial for transmitting neurochemical signals. As organisms age, the ability of neurons to maintain their axons declines; hence aged axons are more susceptible to damage or dysfunction. Understanding what causes axonal vulnerability is crucial for developing strategies to enhance overall resilience of neurons, and to prevent their deterioration during ageing or in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress, a hallmark of ageing and age-related diseases. Despite this association, a causal relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal ageing remains unclear, particularly how subcellular physiology is affected by ROS. By using Drosophila-derived primary neuronal cultures and a recently developed in vivo neuronal model of ageing, which involves the visualisation of Drosophila medulla neurons, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress, neuronal ageing and the microtubule cytoskeleton. We find that oxidative stress as a key driver of axonal and synaptic decay, including the appearance of axonal swellings, microtubule alterations in both axons and synapses and the morphological transformation of axonal terminals during ageing. We demonstrate that increased ROS sensitises the microtubule plus end binding factor, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), leading to microtubule defects, affecting neuronal integrity. Furthermore, manipulating EB1 proved to be a valuable therapeutic strategy to prevent ageing hallmarks observed in conditions of elevated ROS. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic pathway linking cellular oxidative stress, the microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal deterioration during ageing and provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of enhancing microtubule plus end physiology to improve the resilience of axons.

">L-type calcium channel blockade with verapamil prevents noise induced neuronal dyssynchrony</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have established the protective effects of calcium channel blockade on the peripheral auditory system in response to noise exposure. While these studies implicate L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) in noise generated dysfunction in the auditory periphery, contributions of LTCCs to noise-induced central dysfunction remains unclear. To begin to elucidate the roles of LTCCs in hearing, peripheral and central auditory function were assessed longitudinally after LTCC blockade. Neuronal synchrony and activity were assessed by analyzing wave I (peripheral) and wave V (central) auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Just prior to a noise exposure resulting in a temporary shift in hearing thresholds, rats were administered verapamil (LTCC blocker) or saline. Verapamil administration prevented the noise-induced decrease in ABR wave I and V amplitudes. Interestingly, when non-noise exposed animals were administered verapamil, wave V amplitude decreased, suggesting that LTCCs are critical for neuronal synchrony in the inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus mediates inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (giASR). Following noise exposure giASR was enhanced, but the enhancement was not prevented by LTCC blockade. These results suggest that while LTCCs are necessary for auditory-related synchronous activity, these channels do not contribute to noise-induced hyperactivity in the inferior colliculus.

">Oral cannabidiol administration in mice during pregnancy and lactation affects early postnatal body weight, fasting glucose, ingestive behavior, anxiety- and obsessive compulsive-like behaviors, and long-term object-memory in adult offspring in a sex-depe</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The consequences of perinatal cannabidiol (CBD) exposure are severely understudied, but are important, given its widespread use and believed safety as a natural supplement. Objective: The objective of this study was to test the health, metabolic, and behavioral consequences of perinatal CBD exposure on dams and their offspring raised to adult. Methods: Primiparous female C57BL/6J mice were orally administered 100 mg/kg CBD in strawberry jam to expose offspring during gestation, lactation, or both using a cross-fostering design. Adult offspring were metabolically profiled using indirect calorimetry and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing. Adults were behaviorally phenotyped, video recorded, and mouse position tracked using DeepLabCut. Results: CBD was detected in maternal plasma using LC-MS 10-min post consumption (34.2 + 1.7 ng/ul) and peaked within 30 min (371.0 + 34.0 ng/ul). Fetal exposure to CBD significantly decreased survival of the pups, and decreased male postnatal development, but did not alter litter size, maternal body weight or pup birth weight. We observed many sex-dependent effects of perinatal CBD exposure. Exposure to CBD during gestation and lactation increased meal size, caloric intake, and respiratory exchange ratio for adult male offspring, while exposure during lactation decreased fasting glucose, but had no effect on clearance. Adult female offspring exposed to CBD during lactation showed increased drink size. Perinatal CBD exposure increased obsessive compulsive- and decreased anxiety-like behaviors (marble burying, light-dark box, elevated-plus maze) in female mice, decreased long-term object memory in male mice, and had no effect on attention tasks for either sex. Conclusions: We conclude that orally-administered CBD during pregnancy affects behavior and metabolism in a sex-dependent manner, and mice are differentially sensitive to exposure during gestation vs. lactation, or both. Because long-term changes are observed following perinatal exposure to the drug, and exposure significantly decreases survival to weaning, more research during development is warranted.

">Sleep induced by mechanosensory stimulation provides cognitive and health benefits in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: Sleep is a complex phenomenon regulated by various factors, including sensory input. Anecdotal observations have suggested that gentle rocking helps babies fall asleep, and experimental studies have verified that rocking promotes sleep in both humans and mice. Recent studies have expanded this understanding, demonstrating that gentle vibration also induces sleep in Drosophila. Natural sleep serves multiple functions, including learning and memory, synaptic downscaling, and clearance of harmful substances associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated whether vibration-induced sleep provides similar cognitive and health benefits in Drosophila. Methods: We administered gentle vibration to flies that slept very little due to a forced activation of wake-promoting neurons and investigated how the vibration influenced learning and memory in the courtship conditioning paradigm. Additionally, we examined the effects of VIS on synaptic downscaling by counting synapse numbers of select neurons. Finally, we determined whether vibration could induce sleep in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and promote the clearance of Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) and Tubulin Associated Unit (TAU). Results: Vibration-induced sleep enhanced performance in a courtship conditioning paradigm and reduced the number of synapses in select neurons. Moreover, vibration improved sleep in Drosophila models of AD, promoting the clearance of A{beta} and TAU. Conclusions: Mechanosensory stimulation offers a promising non-invasive avenue for enhancing sleep, potentially providing associated cognitive and health benefits.

">Deep learning-driven neuromorphogenesis screenings identify repurposable drugs for mitochondrial disease</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial disease encompasses untreatable conditions affecting tissues with high energy demands. A severe manifestation of mitochondrial disease is Leigh syndrome (Leigh), which causes defects in basal ganglia and midbrain regions, psychomotor regression, lactic acidosis, and early death. We previously generated isogenic pairs of Leigh cerebral organoids and uncovered defects in neuromorphogenesis. Here, we leveraged on this disease feature to devise drug discovery pipelines. We developed a deep learning algorithm tailored for cell type-specific drug repurposing to identify drugs capable of promoting neuronal commitment. In parallel, we performed a survival drug screen in yeast and validated the repurposable hits on branching capacity in Leigh neurons. The two approaches independently highlighted azole compounds, Talarozole and Sertaconazole, both of which lowered lactate release and improved neurogenesis and neurite organization in Leigh midbrain organoids. Hence, targeting neuromorphogenesis has led to identify potential new drugs for mitochondrial disease and could prove an effective strategy for further drug discovery.

">Disentangling the Roles of Distinct Cell Classes with Cell-Type Dynamical Systems</a></h4>

              
                Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, or to accurately predict the effects of cell-specific optogenetic perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the "cell-type dynamical systems" (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for E and I cells, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that both E and I latents could be used to decode the animal's choice, showing that choice-related information is not restricted to a single cell class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the causal effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model which lacks the ability to capture cell-specific perturbations did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.

">The replication principle revisited: a shared functional organization between pulvinar-cortical and cortico-cortical connectivity and its structural and molecular imaging correlates</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar, the largest nucleus in the human thalamus, is a complex, highly interconnected structure. Through a dense, organized network of cortical and subcortical areas, it provides adequate cooperation between neural systems, which is crucial for multiple high-order functions such as perception, visuospatial attention, and emotional processing. Such a central role is made possible by a precise internal topographical organization, which is mirrored by anatomical connections as well as by the expression of neurochemical markers. While being traditionally subdivided into sub-nuclei, each characterized by distinct connectional and morphological features, recent studies in both primate and human brains have highlighted that this topographical organization only marginally aligns with the conventional histological subdivision. Instead, it has been delineated in the context of continuous gradients of cortical connections along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. While this multi-gradient organization has been extensively documented in primate models, it remains relatively underexplored in the human brain. The present work combines high-quality, multi-modal structural and functional imaging data with a recently published whole-brain, large-scale, positron emission tomography (PET) atlas detailing 19 neurotransmitters and receptors distributed across the human brain. By applying diffusion embedding analysis to tractography, functional connectivity, and receptor coexpression data, we identify and characterize multiple topographically organized gradients of structural connections, functional coactivation, and molecular binding patterns. We demonstrate that such gradients converge on a shared representation along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes of the human pulvinar. This representation aligns with transitions in both structural and functional connectivity, spanning from lower-level to higher-order cortical regions. Moreover, it is paralleled by gradual changes in the expression of molecular markers associated with key neuromodulator systems, including serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioid systems. We contend that our findings mark a significant stride towards a more comprehensive understanding of pulvinar anatomy and function, providing a nuanced characterization of its role in health and disease.

">Brain Segregation and Integration Relate to Word-Finding Abilities in Older and Younger Adults</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has shown that word-finding difficulties in older age are associated with functional and structural brain changes. However, the use of functional brain networks, measured through electroencephalography, to predict word-finding in older and younger adults has not yet been investigated. This study utilised resting-state electroencephalography data (61 channels) from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions dataset (Babayan et al., 2019) to investigate the relationship between functional brain networks and word-finding ability in healthy younger and older adults. Graph theory-based measures in individualised delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands were computed to assess brain segregation and integration of 53 older (aged 59-77) and 53 younger right-handed adults (aged 20-35). Word-finding ability was quantified as the number of orally produced words during a semantic and letter fluency task. Multiple linear regression revealed that, in older adults, greater functional connectedness in the delta band was associated with lower semantic fluency. Irrespective of age, greater modularity in the alpha band was related to lower semantic fluency. A greater small-world index in the delta band was related to better semantic fluency, irrespective of age. Increased brain integration in the delta band corresponded to greater semantic fluency in older adults. Hence, word-finding ability seems to be related to brain segregation and integration specific to the frequency band, possibly indicating alterations in cognitive control or compensatory shifts to less functionally specific frequency bands. The article further provides a discussion on neural dedifferentiation, hyper-synchronisation, study limitations, and directions for future research.

">A shared threat-anticipation circuit is dynamically engaged at different moments by certain and uncertain threat</a></h4>

              
                Temporal dynamics play a central role in models of emotion: "fear" is widely conceptualized as a phasic response to certain-and-imminent danger, whereas "anxiety" is a sustained response to uncertain-or-distal harm. Yet the underlying human neurobiology remains contentious. Leveraging an ethnoracially diverse sample, translationally relevant paradigm, and theory-driven modeling approach, we demonstrate that certain and uncertain threat recruit a shared threat-anticipation circuit. This circuit exhibits persistently elevated activation when anticipating uncertain threat encounters and a transient burst of activation in the moments before certain encounters. For many scientists and clinicians, feelings are the defining feature of human fear and anxiety. Here we used an independently validated brain signature to covertly decode the momentary dynamics of anticipatory distress for the first time. Results mirrored the dynamics of neural activation. These observations provide fresh insights into the neurobiology of threat-elicited emotions and set the stage for more ambitious clinical and mechanistic research.

	<p>Emotion dysregulation has long been considered a key symptom in multiple psychiatric disorders. Difficulties in emotion regulation have been associated with neural dysregulation in fronto-limbic circuits. Real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) has become increasingly popular as a potential treatment for emotional dysregulation in psychiatric disorders, as it is able to directly target the impaired neural circuits. However, the clinical impact of these rt-fMRI-NFB protocols in psychiatric populations is still largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of primary studies from 2010 to 2023 that used rt-fMRI-NFB to target emotion regulation. We assessed 41 out of 4001 original studies for methodological quality and risk of bias and synthesised concerning the frequency of significant rt-fMRI-NFB-related effects on the neural and behaviour level. Successful modulation of brain activity was reported in between 25 and 50 percent of study samples, while neural effects in clinical samples were more diverse than in healthy samples. Interestingly, the frequency of rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was over 75 percent in clinical samples, while healthy samples showed behavioural improvements between 0 and 25 percent. Concerning clinical subsamples, rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was observed in up to 100 percent of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) samples. Substance use samples showed behavioural benefits ranging between 50 and 75 percent. Neural effects appeared to be less frequent than behavioural improvements: most neural outcomes ranged between 25 and 50 percent for MDD and substance use and between 0 and 25 percent for PTSD. Using multiple individualised regions of interest (ROIs) for rt-fMRI-NFB training resulted in more frequent behavioural benefits than rt-fMRI-NFB solely based on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. While a significant improvement in behavioural outcomes was reported in most clinical studies, the study protocols were heterogeneous, which limits the current evaluation of rt-fMRI-NFB as a putative treatment for emotional dysregulation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and progressive neuropsychiatric illness. Apart from positive and negative symptoms, 98% of the population diagnosed with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive functioning, which significantly influences the quality of life. The correlation between lipids and cognitive functioning has been well established. Our study aimed to investigate correlations between cognitive functions, the severity of schizophrenia symptoms, and lipid profiles. (2) Methods: Fifty-two women diagnosed with schizophrenia participated in this study. Cognitive functioning was measured using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used. The serum lipid profile, including low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and triglycerides was measured. (3) Results: Better cognitive functions were associated with normal HDL levels, while low HDL levels correlated with worse WSCT scores. Only the PANSS negative subscale showed a correlation with HDL levels. Correlations with chronicity of schizophrenia and the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s age with poorer cognitive functions, but not with symptom severity, were detected. Early/late age at onset did not influence WSCT scores (4). Conclusions: Our results suggest high HDL levels might be a protective factor against cognitive impairment. The influences of age and illness duration also play a vital role in cognitive performance.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the significance of baseline measurements for amateur team athletes playing contact and collision team sports with a specific focus on the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to improve concussion management. Symptoms of sports-related concussions (SRCs) can be diverse and long-lasting and include cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and vestibular dysfunction. Therefore, comprehensive baseline data are essential to preventing recurrent concussions and secondary injuries. This study was conducted during the 2023 off-season and evaluated the baseline condition of 65 male university rugby players using the SCAT5, which includes self-reported symptoms, and the modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS). The athletes were assessed for the presence or absence of SRC, and the mean values were compared using the Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test. Among the participants, 35.38% (23/65) reported symptoms, with an average of 1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 symptoms per player and an average symptom score of 2.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.93. In the mBESS, no errors were observed in the tandem stance test; however, 72.31% (47/65) made errors in the single-leg stance test on the non-dominant foot, with an average of 1.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 errors. Many athletes self-reported symptoms and balance errors, even during asymptomatic periods before experiencing concussion, indicating unresolved issues. In the injury history survey, the baseline evaluations and injury histories of the participants classified into the SRC and non-SRC groups were compared. In the mBESS single-leg stance test (non-dominant foot), 84.21% (32/38) of the SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 2.13 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.52, whereas 55.55% (15/27) of the non-SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 1.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.35, showing a significant difference (p = 0.007). Additionally, significant differences were observed in the average number of ankle sprains (p = 0.027) and fractures (p = 0.048) between patients with and without a history of SRC. These findings indicate that athletes may have underlying issues even during normal periods before concussion. Moreover, the results highlighted the impact of previous concussions on motor control and injury risk. This underscores the importance of preseason baseline measurements using the SCAT to identify at-risk athletes and implement preventive measures. These findings align with the recommendations of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport and suggest further refinement of concussion assessment tools.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a significant concern as it is a risk factor for AD progression, and early detection is vital in order to delay dementia onset and enable potential therapeutic interventions. Olfactory impairment is recognized as a predictive biomarker in neurodegenerative processes. The aims of this study were to explore the degree of entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) and the severity of MCI symptoms; to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results for the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, peri entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellar tentorium; and to perform a comprehensive neuropsychological and psychophysical assessment. The main results highlighted that in our sample&amp;amp;mdash;multidomain amnesic MCI patients with hyposmic symptomatology&amp;amp;mdash;we found that ERICA scores were associated with the severity of anxiety symptomatology. One possible hypothesis to explain this observation is that anxiety may contribute to neurodegenerative processes by inducing chronic stress and inflammation. Future research should consider the longitudinal development of neuropsychological scores, anxiety disorders, and brain atrophy to determine their potential predictive value for MCI progression. These findings suggest the importance of psychological factors in MCI progression and the utility of neuropsychological assessment alongside neuroimaging techniques for early detection and follow-up in MCI patients.</p>

	<p>Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF)-induced illusion of hand movements produces beneficial effects in patients with chronic pain. However, neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly known. In this preliminary study, we test the novel hypothesis that such an MVF-induced movement illusion may exert its effects by changing the activity in midline cortical areas associated with pain processing. Electrical stimuli with individually fixed intensity were applied to the left hand of healthy adults to produce painful and non-painful sensations during unilateral right-hand movements with such an MVF illusion and right and bilateral hand movements without MVF. During these events, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG alpha rhythms (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz) indexed the neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms inducing cortical activation. Compared to the painful sensations, the non-painful sensations were specifically characterized by (1) lower alpha ERD estimated in the cortical midline, angular gyrus, and lateral parietal regions during the experimental condition with MVF and (2) higher alpha ERD estimated in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions during the control conditions without MVF. These preliminary results suggest that the MVF-induced movement illusion may affect nociception and neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms, reducing the activation in cortical limbic and default mode regions.</p>

	<p>Over the past three decades, substantial advancements have occurred in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). These developments encompass various non-invasive techniques aimed at modulating brain function. Among the most widely utilized methods today are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which include direct- or alternating-current transcranial stimulation (tDCS/tACS). In addition to these established techniques, newer modalities have emerged, broadening the scope of non-invasive neuromodulation approaches available for research and clinical applications in movement disorders, particularly for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and, to a lesser extent, atypical Parkinsonism (AP). All NIBS techniques offer the opportunity to explore a wide range of neurophysiological mechanisms and exert influence over distinct brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism. This paper&amp;amp;rsquo;s first aim is to provide a brief overview of the historical background and underlying physiological principles of primary NIBS techniques, focusing on their translational relevance. It aims to shed light on the potential identification of biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, by summarising available experimental data on individuals with Parkinsonism. To date, despite promising findings indicating the potential utility of NIBS techniques in Parkinsonism, their integration into clinical routine for diagnostic or therapeutic protocols remains a subject of ongoing investigation and scientific debate. In this context, this paper addresses current unsolved issues and methodological challenges concerning the use of NIBS, focusing on the importance of future research endeavours for maximizing the efficacy and relevance of NIBS strategies for individuals with Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and improves motor performance when applied unilaterally to the dominant hemisphere. However, the influence of tDCS on contralateral M1 excitability both during and after application has not been quantified. The purpose was to determine the influence of tDCS applied to the dominant M1 on the excitability of the contralateral non-dominant M1. This study employed a double-blind, randomized, SHAM-controlled, within-subject crossover experimental design. Eighteen young adults performed two experimental sessions (tDCS, SHAM) in counterbalanced order separated by a one-week washout. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to quantify the excitability of the contralateral M1 to which anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min with a current strength of 1 mA. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed in 5 TMS test blocks (Pre, D5, D10, D15, and Post). The Pre and Post TMS test blocks were performed immediately before and after tDCS application, whereas the TMS test blocks performed during tDCS were completed at the 5, 10, and 15 min stimulation timepoints. MEPs were analyzed with a 2 condition (tDCS, SHAM) &amp;amp;times; 5 test (Pre, D5, D10, D15, Post) within-subject ANOVA. The main effect for condition (p = 0.213), the main effect for test (p = 0.502), and the condition &amp;amp;times; test interaction (p = 0.860) were all not statistically significant. These results indicate that tDCS does not modulate contralateral M1 excitability during or immediately after application, at least under the current set of common tDCS parameters of stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0263-24.2024?rss=1">Enhanced Synaptic Inhibition in the Dorsolateral Geniculate Nucleus in a Mouse Model of Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) triggers glaucoma by damaging the output neurons of the retina called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This leads to the loss of RGC signaling to visual centers of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is critical for processing and relaying information to the cortex for conscious vision. In response to altered levels of activity or synaptic input, neurons can homeostatically modulate postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor numbers, allowing them to scale their synaptic responses to stabilize spike output. While prior work has indicated unaltered glutamate receptor properties in the glaucomatous dLGN, it is unknown whether glaucoma impacts dLGN inhibition. Here, using DBA/2J mice, which develop elevated IOP beginning at 6&ndash;7&nbsp;months of age, we tested whether the strength of inhibitory synapses on dLGN thalamocortical relay neurons is altered in response to the disease state. We found an enhancement of feedforward disynaptic inhibition arising from local interneurons along with increased amplitude of quantal inhibitory synaptic currents. A combination of immunofluorescence staining for the -aminobutyric acid (GABA)<SUB>A</SUB>-&alpha;1 receptor subunit, peak-scaled nonstationary fluctuation analysis, and measures of homeostatic synaptic scaling pointed to an ~1.4-fold increase in GABA receptors at postsynaptic inhibitory synapses, although several pieces of evidence indicate a nonuniform scaling across inhibitory synapses within individual relay neurons. Together, these results indicate an increase in inhibitory synaptic strength in the glaucomatous dLGN, potentially pointing toward homeostatic compensation for disruptions in network and neuronal function triggered by increased IOP.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0515-23.2024?rss=1">Exploring Electrocortical Signatures of Gait Adaptation: Differential Neural Dynamics in Slow and Fast Gait Adapters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait adaptation.</p>

                Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-coupled protein receptor that induces crucial biological processes when bound by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Here, we have characterized nine S1PR1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                One of the factors causing rice production disturbance in Indonesia is that farmers lack knowledge of early symptoms of rice plant diseases. These diseases are increasingly rampant because of the lack of experts. This study aimed to overcome this problem by providing an Expert System that helps farmers to make an early diagnosis of rice plant diseases. Data of rice plant pests and diseases in 2016 were taken from Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia using an in-depth survey, and rice experts from the Department of Food Crops and Horticulture of East Kalimantan Province were recruited for the project. The Expert System for Rice Plant Disease Diagnosis, ESforRPD2, was developed based on the pest and disease experiences of the rice experts and uses a Waterfall Paradigm and Unified Modeling Language. This Expert System can detect 48 symptoms and 8 types of diseases of rice plants from 16 data tests with a sensitivity of 87.5%. The system can also provide recommendations for the treatment of identified diseases. ESforRPD2 is available in Indonesian at http://esforrpd2.blog.unmul.ac.id

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-791/v1?src=rss">Real Customization or Just Marketing: Are Customized Versions of Generative AI Useful? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-790/v1?src=rss">Prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms from online learning during the COVID-19 epidemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                <p>by Ziyan Guo, Jialu Yu, Wenxin Wang, Patricia Lockwood, Zhen Wu</p>

Altruistic punishment is key to establishing cooperation and maintaining social order, yet its developmental trends across cultures remain unclear. Using computational reinforcement learning models, we provided the first evidence of how social feedback dynamically influences group-biased altruistic punishment across cultures and the lifespan. Study 1 (<i>n</i> = 371) found that Chinese participants exhibited higher learning rates than Americans when socially incentivized to punish unfair allocations. Additionally, Chinese adults showed slower learning and less exploration when punishing ingroups than outgroups, a pattern absent in American counterparts, potentially reflecting a tendency towards ingroup favoritism that may contribute to reinforcing collectivist values. Study 2 (<i>n</i> = 430, aged 12–52) further showed that such ingroup favoritism develops with age. Chinese participants’ learning rates for ingroup punishment decreased from adolescence into adulthood, while outgroup rates stayed constant, implying a process of cultural learning. Our findings highlight cultural and age-related variations in altruistic punishment learning, with implications for social reinforcement learning and culturally sensitive educational practices promoting fairness and altruism.

                <p>by Vinoth Manivannan, Mandar M. Inamdar, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Cells switch genes ON or OFF by altering the state of chromatin via histone modifications at specific regulatory locations along the chromatin polymer. These gene regulation processes are carried out by a network of reactions in which the histone marks spread to neighboring regions with the help of enzymes. In the literature, this spreading has been studied as a purely kinetic, non-diffusive process considering the interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this work, we go beyond this framework and study the spreading of modifications using a reaction-diffusion (RD) model accounting for the diffusion of the constituents. We quantitatively segregate the modification profiles generated from kinetic and RD models. The diffusion and degradation of enzymes set a natural length scale for limiting the domain size of modification spreading, and the resulting enzyme limitation is inherent in our model. We also demonstrate the emergence of confined modification domains without the explicit requirement of a nucleation site. We explore polymer compaction effects on spreading and show that single-cell domains may differ from averaged profiles. We find that the modification profiles from our model are comparable with existing H3K9me3 data of <i>S. pombe</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011953">An integrative approach to protein sequence design through multiobjective optimization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Hong, Tanja Kortemme</p>

With recent methodological advances in the field of computational protein design, in particular those based on deep learning, there is an increasing need for frameworks that allow for coherent, direct integration of different models and objective functions into the generative design process. Here we demonstrate how evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques can be adapted to provide such an approach. With the established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) as the optimization framework, we use AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN confidence metrics to define the objective space, and a mutation operator composed of ESM-1v and ProteinMPNN to rank and then redesign the least favorable positions. Using the two-state design problem of the foldswitching protein RfaH as an in-depth case study, and PapD and calmodulin as examples of higher-dimensional design problems, we show that the evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach leads to significant reduction in the bias and variance in RfaH native sequence recovery, compared to a direct application of ProteinMPNN. We suggest that this improvement is due to three factors: (i) the use of an informative mutation operator that accelerates the sequence space exploration, (ii) the parallel, iterative design process inherent to the genetic algorithm that improves upon the ProteinMPNN autoregressive sequence decoding scheme, and (iii) the explicit approximation of the Pareto front that leads to optimal design candidates representing diverse tradeoff conditions. We anticipate this approach to be readily adaptable to different models and broadly relevant for protein design tasks with complex specifications.

The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process.

                <p>by Maud Delattre, Yusuke Toda, Jessica Tressou, Hiroyoshi Iwata</p>

The evaluation of plant and animal growth, separately for genetic and environmental effects, is necessary for genetic understanding and genetic improvement of environmental responses of plants and animals. We propose to extend an existing approach that combines nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLMEM) and the stochastic approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (SAEM) to analyze genetic and environmental effects on plant growth. These tools are widely used in many fields but very rarely in plant biology. During model formulation, a nonlinear function describes the shape of growth, and random effects describe genetic and environmental effects and their variability. Genetic relationships among the varieties were also integrated into the model using a genetic relationship matrix. The SAEM algorithm was chosen as an efficient alternative to MCMC methods, which are more commonly used in the domain. It was implemented to infer the expected growth patterns in the analyzed population and the expected curves for each variety through a maximum-likelihood and a maximum-a-posteriori approaches, respectively. The obtained estimates can be used to predict the growth curves for each variety. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach using simulated data and soybean plant growth data obtained from a soybean cultivation experiment conducted at the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University. In this experiment, plant height was measured daily using drones, and the growth was monitored for approximately 200 soybean cultivars for which whole-genome sequence data were available. The NLMEM approach improved our understanding of the determinants of soybean growth and can be successfully used for the genomic prediction of growth pattern characteristics.

                <p>by Katherine S. Yanagi, Briar Jochim, Sheikh Omar Kunjo, Peter Breen, Gary Ruvkun, Nicolas Lehrbach</p>

The conserved SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcription factor regulates the expression of proteasome subunit genes and is essential for maintenance of adequate proteasome function in animal development, aging, and stress responses. Unusual among transcription factors, SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a glycoprotein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylated SKN-1A/Nrf1 exits the ER and is deglycosylated in the cytosol by the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase. Deglycosylation edits the protein sequence of SKN-1A/Nrf1 by converting N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartate, which is necessary for SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcriptional activation of proteasome subunit genes. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the peptide:N-glycanase (NGLY1) gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, a congenital disorder of deglycosylation. There are no effective treatments for NGLY1 deficiency. Since SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a major client of NGLY1, the resulting proteasome deficit contributes to NGLY1 disease. We sought to identify targets for mitigation of proteasome dysfunction in NGLY1 deficiency that might indicate new avenues for treatment. We isolated mutations that suppress the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors caused by inactivation of the NGLY1 ortholog PNG-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We identified multiple suppressor mutations affecting 3 conserved genes: <i>rsks-1</i>, <i>tald-1</i>, and <i>ent-4</i>. We show that the suppressors act through a SKN-1/Nrf-independent mechanism and confer proteostasis benefits consistent with amelioration of proteasome dysfunction. <i>ent-4</i> encodes an intestinal nucleoside/nucleotide transporter, and we show that restriction of nucleotide availability is beneficial, whereas a nucleotide-rich diet exacerbates proteasome dysfunction in PNG-1/NGLY1-deficient <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Our findings suggest that dietary or pharmacological interventions altering nucleotide availability have the potential to mitigate proteasome insufficiency in NGLY1 deficiency and other diseases associated with proteasome dysfunction.

Reactive astrocytes are associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in diverse neuropathologies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the crucial roles of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in cognitive decline. Our results showed that repeated optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes induced cognitive impairment in mice and decreased synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), which was accompanied by the appearance of inflammatory astrocytes. Mechanistic studies conducted using knockout animal models and hippocampal neuronal cultures showed that lipocalin-2 (LCN2), derived from reactive astrocytes, mediated neuroinflammation and induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the LTP through the reduction of neuronal NMDA receptors. Sustained chemogenetic stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes provided similar results. Conversely, these phenomena were attenuated by a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes. Fiber photometry using GCaMP revealed a high level of hippocampal astrocyte activation in the neuroinflammation model. Our findings suggest that reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are sufficient and required to induce cognitive decline through LCN2 release and synaptic modulation. This abnormal glial–neuron interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in neuroinflammation-associated brain conditions.

Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) are model systems for global biodiversity science, but continuing data gaps, limited data standardisation, and ongoing flux in taxonomic nomenclature constrain integrative research on this group and potentially cause biased inference. We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.

                <p>by George A. Schaible, Zackary J. Jay, John Cliff, Frederik Schulz, Colin Gauvin, Danielle Goudeau, Rex R. Malmstrom, S. Emil Ruff, Virginia Edgcomb, Roland Hatzenpichler</p>

Consortia of multicellular magnetotactic bacteria (MMB) are currently the only known example of bacteria without a unicellular stage in their life cycle. Because of their recalcitrance to cultivation, most previous studies of MMB have been limited to microscopic observations. To study the biology of these unique organisms in more detail, we use multiple culture-independent approaches to analyze the genomics and physiology of MMB consortia at single-cell resolution. We separately sequenced the metagenomes of 22 individual MMB consortia, representing 8 new species, and quantified the genetic diversity within each MMB consortium. This revealed that, counter to conventional views, cells within MMB consortia are not clonal. Single consortia metagenomes were then used to reconstruct the species-specific metabolic potential and infer the physiological capabilities of MMB. To validate genomic predictions, we performed stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments and interrogated MMB consortia using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). By coupling FISH with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), we explored their in situ activity as well as variation of protein synthesis within cells. We demonstrate that MMB consortia are mixotrophic sulfate reducers and that they exhibit metabolic differentiation between individual cells, suggesting that MMB consortia are more complex than previously thought. These findings expand our understanding of MMB diversity, ecology, genomics, and physiology, as well as offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the multicellular nature of their unique lifestyle.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1492/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Disseminated hydatid cyst: Unusual presentation and therapeutic challenges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, is a parasitic disease prevalent in endemic regions. CE frequently leads to the formation of hydatid cysts in various organs, with the liver being the most commonly affected site. Involvement of the spleen has been rarely reported in the literature. Managing disseminated hydatid cyst disease presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case presentation: A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for 3 days. She had a recent travel history to Egypt. Physical examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray and pan-computed tomography (Pan-CT) scans identified multiple cystic lesions in the lung, liver and spleen. Serological tests confirmed the presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated hydatid cyst disease. The patient was managed medically and surgically by a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: Disseminated hydatid cyst disease, though rare, presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Timely recognition, supported by clinical, radiological, and serological assessments, is essential. Surgical intervention should be considered in a patient when multiple extrahepatic cysts are present, and rupture is evident, as this approach can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mitigate life-threatening complications.

                Purpose: To report the ocular surface and meibomian gland changes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women taking hormone supplementation. Methods: Case series. Results: Three women (27 ± 11 years) already diagnosed with PCOS presented with dry eye symptoms (mean OSDI, 37.5) for a mean duration of 13 months and were taking hormonal supplements for a mean duration of 60 ± 11 months. The hormonal supplements included oral estrogen (n=3), oral progesterone (n=3), antiandrogen cyproterone (n=1) and isotretinoin (n=1). Ocular surface evaluation revealed mean NIBUT of 9.9 ± 1.6 seconds and mean TMH of 0.27 ± 0.05 mm, assessed non-invasively using Oculus keratograph 5M (K5M). Meibography (K5M) showed near total loss of all meibomian glands (n=8/12 eyelids) with residual ghost glands in all four eyelids of two patients, and gland shortening alone in one patient. The gland morphology did not change following intense thermal pulsation treatment or cessation of hormonal therapy. Conclusions: Near-total irreversible meibomian gland loss was seen in two young PCOS women taking hormonal supplements. Collaboration between ophthalmologists and gynecologists is advisable for early detection and better understanding of dry eye disease (DED) progression in these patients.

     alt="Sexual Dimorphism of Spinal Neural Circuits Controlling the Mouse External Urethral Sphincter With and Without Spinal Cord Injury"/>
<p>Spinal neuronal pool innervating external urethral sphincter (EUS) in female mice has less motoneurons and interneurons compared to males. Spinal cord injury caused the reduction of EUS-related neuronal pool in males but not in females. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts coordination between the bladder and the external urinary sphincter (EUS), leading to transient or permanent voiding impairment, which is more severe in males. Male versus female differences in spinal circuits related to the EUS as well as post-SCI rewiring are essential for understanding of sex-/gender-specific impairments and possible recovery mechanisms. To quantitatively assess differences between EUS circuits in males versus females and in spinal intact (SI) versus SCI animals, we retrogradely traced and counted EUS-related neurons. In transgenic ChAT-GFP mice, motoneurons (MNs), interneurons (INs), and propriospinal neurons (PPNs) were retrogradely trans-synaptically traced with PRV614-red fluorescent protein (RFP) injected into EUS. EUS-MNs in dorsolateral nucleus (DLN) were separated from other GFP<sup>+</sup> MNs by tracing them with FluoroGold (FG). We found two morphologically distinct cell types in DLN: FG<sup>+</sup> spindle-shaped bipolar (SB-MNs) and FG<sup>−</sup> rounded multipolar (RM-MNs) cholinergic cells. Number of MNs of both types in males was twice as large as in females. SCI caused a partial loss of MNs in all spinal nuclei. After SCI, males showed a fourfold rise in the number of RFP-labeled cells in retro-DLN (RDLN) innervating hind limbs. This suggests (a) an existence of direct synaptic interactions between spinal nuclei and (b) a post-SCI increase of non-specific inputs to EUS-MNs from other motor nuclei. Number of INs and PPNs deferred between males and females: In SI males, the numbers of INs and PPNs were ∼10 times larger than in SI females. SCI caused a twofold decrease of INs and PPNs in males but not in females.</p>

     alt="Early Development of the Thalamo-Pallial Stage of the Tectofugal Visual Pathway in the Chicken (Gallus gallus)"/>
<p>We studied in chicken embryos the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial stages of the tectofugal visual system by means of immunohistochemical assays and ex vivo injections of neural tracers. We found that the layered organization of the visual DVR as well as the system of columnar reciprocal connections between vDVR layers (blue axons) were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection (light blue axons) was also present at this stage. Immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization (green, light blue, and blue axons) arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit (black and yellow axons; green soma).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The tectofugal pathway is a highly conserved visual pathway in all amniotes. In birds and mammals, retinorecipient neurons located in the midbrain roof (optic tectum/superior colliculus) are the source of ascending projections to thalamic relays (nucleus rotundus/caudal pulvinar), which in turn project to specific pallial regions (visual dorsal ventricular ridge [vDVR]/temporal cortex) organized according to a columnar recurrent arrangement of interlaminar circuits. Whether or to which extent these striking hodological correspondences arise from comparable developmental processes is at present an open question, mainly due to the scarcity of data about the ontogeny of the avian tectofugal system. Most of the previous developmental studies of this system in birds have focused on the establishment of the retino-tecto-thalamic connectivity, overlooking the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial circuit. In this work, we studied the latter in chicken embryos by means of immunohistochemical assays and precise ex vivo crystalline injections of biocytin and DiI. We found that the layered organization of the vDVR as well as the system of homotopic reciprocal connections between vDVR layers were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection was also present at this stage. Our immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92534">Bacteria are a major determinant of Orsay virus transmission and infection in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The microbiota is a key determinant of the physiology and immunity of animal hosts. The factors governing the transmissibility of viruses between susceptible hosts are incompletely understood. Bacteria serve as food for <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and represent an integral part of the natural environment of <i>C. elegans</i>. We determined the effects of bacteria isolated with <i>C. elegans</i> from its natural environment on the transmission of Orsay virus in <i>C. elegans</i> using quantitative virus transmission and host susceptibility assays. We observed that <i>Ochrobactrum</i> species promoted Orsay virus transmission, whereas <i>Pseudomonas lurida</i> MYb11 attenuated virus transmission relative to the standard laboratory bacterial food <i>Escherichia coli</i> OP50. We found that pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains PA01 and PA14 further attenuated virus transmission. We determined that the amount of Orsay virus required to infect 50% of a <i>C. elegans</i> population on <i>P. lurida</i> MYb11 compared with <i>Ochrobactrum vermis</i> MYb71 was dramatically increased, over three orders of magnitude. Host susceptibility was attenuated even further in the presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PA14. Genetic analysis of the determinants of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> required for attenuation of <i>C. elegans</i> susceptibility to Orsay virus infection revealed a role for regulators of quorum sensing. Our data suggest that distinct constituents of the <i>C. elegans</i> microbiota and potential pathogens can have widely divergent effects on Orsay virus transmission, such that associated bacteria can effectively determine host susceptibility versus resistance to viral infection. Our study provides quantitative evidence for a critical role for tripartite host-virus-bacteria interactions in determining the transmissibility of viruses among susceptible hosts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92426">Human DDX6 regulates translation and decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings indicate that the translation elongation rate influences mRNA stability. One of the factors that has been implicated in this link between mRNA decay and translation speed is the yeast DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p. Here, we demonstrated that the human ortholog of Dhh1p, DDX6, triggers the deadenylation-dependent decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs in human cells. DDX6 interacts with the ribosome through the Phe-Asp-Phe (FDF) motif in its RecA2 domain. Furthermore, RecA2-mediated interactions and ATPase activity are both required for DDX6 to destabilize inefficiently translated mRNAs. Using ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, we identified two classes of endogenous mRNAs that are regulated in a DDX6-dependent manner. The identified targets are either translationally regulated or regulated at the steady-state-level and either exhibit signatures of poor overall translation or of locally reduced ribosome translocation rates. Transferring the identified sequence stretches into a reporter mRNA caused translation- and DDX6-dependent degradation of the reporter mRNA. In summary, these results identify DDX6 as a crucial regulator of mRNA translation and decay triggered by slow ribosome movement and provide insights into the mechanism by which DDX6 destabilizes inefficiently translated mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96281">Chronic activation of a negative engram induces behavioral and cellular abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                Negative memories engage a brain and body-wide stress response in humans that can alter cognition and behavior. Prolonged stress responses induce maladaptive cellular, circuit, and systems-level changes that can lead to pathological brain states and corresponding disorders in which mood and memory are affected. However, it is unclear if repeated activation of cells processing negative memories induces similar phenotypes in mice. In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging method to access neuronal ensembles and assess their molecular characteristics. Sequencing memory engrams in mice revealed that positive (male-to-female exposure) and negative (foot shock) cells upregulated genes linked to anti- and pro-inflammatory responses, respectively. To investigate the impact of persistent activation of negative engrams, we chemogenetically activated them in the ventral hippocampus over 3 months and conducted anxiety and memory-related tests. Negative engram activation increased anxiety behaviors in both 6- and 14-month-old mice, reduced spatial working memory in older mice, impaired fear extinction in younger mice, and heightened fear generalization in both age groups. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in microglial and astrocytic structure and number in the hippocampus. In summary, repeated activation of negative memories induces lasting cellular and behavioral abnormalities in mice, offering insights into the negative effects of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors on human health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89478">The target of rapamycin signaling pathway regulates vegetative development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus</a></h4>

              
                The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes in eukaryotes. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanism of the TOR pathway in <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> remains elusive. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the TOR signaling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i> by identifying and characterizing nine genes that encode distinct components of this pathway. The FK506-binding protein Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The TorA kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and responses to rapamycin and cell membrane stress. As a significant downstream effector molecule of the TorA kinase, the Sch9 kinase regulates aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) synthesis, osmotic and calcium stress response in <i>A. flavus,</i> and this regulation is mediated through its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains, and the ATP-binding site at K340. We also showed that the Sch9 kinase may have a regulatory impact on the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of the TorA kinase, play a significant role in regulating cell wall stress response in <i>A. flavus</i>. Moreover, the members of the TapA-phosphatase complexes, SitA and Ppg1, are important for various biological processes in <i>A. flavus</i>, including vegetative growth, sclerotia formation, AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that SitA and Ppg1 are involved in regulating lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis and cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathways. In addition, another phosphatase complex, Nem1/Spo7, plays critical roles in hyphal development, conidiation, aflatoxin production, and LDs biogenesis. Collectively, our study has provided important insight into the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and has elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91828">Human HPSE2 gene transfer ameliorates bladder pathophysiology in a mutant mouse model of urofacial syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rare early-onset lower urinary tract disorders include defects of functional maturation of the bladder. Current treatments do not target the primary pathobiology of these diseases. Some have a monogenic basis, such as urofacial, or Ochoa, syndrome (UFS). Here, the bladder does not empty fully because of incomplete relaxation of its outflow tract, and subsequent urosepsis can cause kidney failure. UFS is associated with biallelic variants of <i>HPSE2</i>, encoding heparanase-2. This protein is detected in pelvic ganglia, autonomic relay stations that innervate the bladder and control voiding. Bladder outflow tracts of <i>Hpse2</i> mutant mice display impaired neurogenic relaxation. We hypothesized that <i>HPSE2</i> gene transfer soon after birth would ameliorate this defect and explored an adeno-associated viral (<i>AAV</i>) vector-based approach. AAV9<i>/HPSE2,</i> carrying human <i>HPSE2</i> driven by <i>CAG</i>, was administered intravenously into neonatal mice. In the third postnatal week, transgene transduction and expression were sought, and ex vivo myography was undertaken to measure bladder function. In mice administered AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i>, the viral genome was detected in pelvic ganglia. Human <i>HPSE2</i> was expressed and heparanase-2 became detectable in pelvic ganglia of treated mutant mice. On autopsy, wild-type mice had empty bladders, whereas bladders were uniformly distended in mutant mice, a defect ameliorated by AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i> treatment. Therapeutically, AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i> significantly ameliorated impaired neurogenic relaxation of <i>Hpse2</i> mutant bladder outflow tracts. Impaired neurogenic contractility of mutant detrusor smooth muscle was also significantly improved. These results constitute first steps towards curing UFS, a clinically devastating genetic disease featuring a bladder autonomic neuropathy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93498">Clustered synapses develop in distinct dendritic domains in visual cortex before eye opening</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic inputs to cortical neurons are highly structured in adult sensory systems, such that neighboring synapses along dendrites are activated by similar stimuli. This organization of synaptic inputs, called synaptic clustering, is required for high-fidelity signal processing, and clustered synapses can already be observed before eye opening. However, how clustered inputs emerge during development is unknown. Here, we employed concurrent in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp and dendritic calcium imaging to map spontaneous synaptic inputs to dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex during the second postnatal week until eye opening. We found that the number of functional synapses and the frequency of transmission events increase several fold during this developmental period. At the beginning of the second postnatal week, synapses assemble specifically in confined dendritic segments, whereas other segments are devoid of synapses. By the end of the second postnatal week, just before eye opening, dendrites are almost entirely covered by domains of co-active synapses. Finally, co-activity with their neighbor synapses correlates with synaptic stabilization and potentiation. Thus, clustered synapses form in distinct functional domains presumably to equip dendrites with computational modules for high-capacity sensory processing when the eyes open.

">Acute rapamycin treatment reveals novel mechanisms of behavioral, physiological, and functional dysfunction in a maternal inflammation mouse model of autism and sensory over-responsivity</a></h4>

              
                Maternal inflammatory response (MIR) during early gestation in mice induces a cascade of physiological and behavioral changes that have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a prior study and the current one, we find that mild MIR results in chronic systemic and neuro-inflammation, mTOR pathway activation, mild brain overgrowth followed by regionally specific volumetric changes, sensory processing dysregulation, and social and repetitive behavior abnormalities. Prior studies of rapamycin treatment in autism models have focused on chronic treatments that might be expected to alter or prevent physical brain changes. Here, we have focused on the acute effects of rapamycin to uncover novel mechanisms of dysfunction and related to mTOR pathway signaling. We find that within 2 hours, rapamycin treatment could rapidly rescue neuronal hyper-excitability, seizure susceptibility, functional network connectivity and brain community structure, and repetitive behaviors and sensory over-responsivity in adult offspring with persistent brain overgrowth. These CNS-mediated effects are also associated with alteration of the expression of several ASD-, ion channel-, and epilepsy-associated genes, in the same time frame. Our findings suggest that mTOR dysregulation in MIR offspring is a key contributor to various levels of brain dysfunction, including neuronal excitability, altered gene expression in multiple cell types, sensory functional network connectivity, and modulation of information flow. However, we demonstrate that the adult MIR brain is also amenable to rapid normalization of these functional changes which results in the rescue of both core and comorbid ASD behaviors in adult animals without requiring long-term physical alterations to the brain. Thus, restoring excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and sensory functional network modularity may be important targets for therapeutically addressing both primary sensory and social behavior phenotypes, and compensatory repetitive behavior phenotypes.

">VTA μ-opioidergic neurons facilitate low sociability in protracted opioid withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                Opioids initiate dynamic maladaptation in brain reward and affect circuits that occur throughout chronic exposure and withdrawal that persist beyond cessation. Protracted withdrawal is characterized by negative affective behaviors such as heightened anxiety, irritability, dysphoria, and anhedonia, which pose a significant risk factor for relapse. While the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mu-opioid recep-tors (MORs) are critical for opioid reinforcement, the specific contributions of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating protracted withdrawal-induced negative affect is not fully understood. In our study, we elucidate the role of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating negative affect and altered brain-wide neuronal activities following opioid exposure and withdrawal in male and female mice. Utilizing a chronic oral mor-phine administration model, we observe increased social deficit, anxiety-related, and despair-like behaviors during protracted with-drawal. VTA-MOR neurons show heightened neuronal FOS activation at the onset of withdrawal and connect to an array of brain regions that mediate reward and affective processes. Viral re-expression of MORs selectively within the VTA of MOR knockout mice demon-strates that the disrupted social interaction observed during protracted withdrawal is facilitated by this neural population, without affect-ing other protracted withdrawal behaviors. Lastly, VTA-MORs contribute to heightened neuronal FOS activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to an acute morphine challenge, suggesting their unique role in modulating ACC-specific neuronal activity. These findings identify VTA-MOR neurons as critical modulators of low sociability during protracted withdrawal and highlight their potential as a mechanistic target to alleviate negative affective behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal.

">Goal-directed action preparation in humans entails a mixture of corticospinal neural computations</a></h4>

              
                The seemingly effortless ability of humans to transition from thinking about actions to initiating them relies on sculpting corticospinal output from primary motor cortex. This study tested whether canonical additive and multiplicative neural computations, well-described in sensory systems, generalize to the corticospinal pathway during human action preparation. We used non-invasive brain stimulation to measure corticospinal input-output across varying action preparation contexts during instructed-delay finger response tasks. Goal-directed action preparation was marked by increased multiplicative gain of corticospinal projections to task-relevant muscles and additive suppression of corticospinal projections to non-selected and task-irrelevant muscles. Individuals who modulated corticospinal gain to a greater extent were faster to initiate prepared responses. Our findings provide physiological evidence of combined additive suppression and gain modulation in the human motor system. We propose these computations support action preparation by enhancing the contrast between selected motor representations and surrounding background activity to facilitate response selection and execution.

">On the replicability of diffusion weighted MRI-based brain-behavior models</a></h4>

              
                Establishing replicable inter-individual brain-wide associations is key to advancing our understanding of the crucial links between brain structure, function, and behavior, as well as applying this knowledge in clinical contexts. While the replicability and sample size requirements for anatomical and functional MRI-based brain-behavior associations have been extensively discussed recently, systematic replicability assessments are still lacking for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), despite it being the dominant non-invasive method to investigate white matter microstructure and structural connectivity. We report results of a comprehensive evaluation of the replicability of various DWI-based multivariate brain-behavior models. This evaluation is based on large-scale data from the Human Connectome Project, including five different DWI-based brain features (from fractional anisotropy to structural connectivity) and 58 different behavioral phenotypes. Our findings show an overall moderate replicability, with 24-31% of phenotypes replicable with sample sizes of fewer than 500. As DWI yields trait-like brain features, we restricted the analysis to trait-like phenotypes, such as cognitive and motor skills, and found much more promising replicability estimates, with 67-75% of these phenotypes replicable with n<500. Contrasting our empirical results to analytical replicability estimates substantiated that the replicability of DWI-based models is primarily a function of the true, unbiased effect size. Our work highlights the potential of DWI to produce replicable brain-behavior associations. However, it shows that achieving replicability with small-to-moderate samples requires stable, reliable and neurobiologically relevant target phenotypes. Our work highlights the potential of DWI to produce replicable brain-behavior associations, but only for stable, reliable and neurobiologically relevant target phenotypes.

">Behavioral and anatomical effects of complex rearing after day 7 neonatal frontal lesions vary with sex</a></h4>

              
                Rats received medial frontal lesions, or sham surgery, on postnatal day 7 (P7), and were placed in complex environments or standard lab housing at weaning. Three months later the animals were tested in a spatial learning task and in a skilled reaching task. Rats with P7 lesions had smaller deficits in spatial learning than similar adult operates, and males performed better than females. Complex housing further improved the performance of male, but not female, lesion rats. The opposite was seen in motor performance as female lesion rats performed better than males and benefited from experience whereas males did not. There was a correlation between behavior and dendritic change as complex housing reversed lesion-induced dendritic atrophy, an effect that was greater in males. P7 frontal males, but not females, showed an increase in spine density that was reversed by complex housing. Experience thus can affect functional and anatomical outcome after early brain injury, but the effects vary with sex.

">Temporal resolution of spike coding in feedforward networks with signal convergence and divergence</a></h4>

              
                Convergent and divergent structures in the networks that make up biological brains are found universally across many species and brain regions at various scales. Neurons in these networks fire action potentials, or "spikes", whose precise timing is becoming increasingly appreciated as large sources of information about both sensory input and motor output. While previous theories on coding in convergent and divergent networks have largely neglected the role of precise spike timing, our model and analyses place this aspect at the forefront. For a suite of stimuli with different timescales, we demonstrate that structural bottlenecks (small groups of neurons) post-synaptic to network convergence have a stronger preference for spike timing codes than expansion layers created by structural divergence. Additionally, we found that a simple network model with similar convergence and divergence ratios to those found experimentally can reproduce the relative contribution of spike timing information about motor output in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Our simulations and analyses suggest a relationship between the level of convergent/divergent structure present in a feedforward network and the loss of stimulus information encoded by its population spike trains as their temporal resolution decreases, which could be confirmed experimentally across diverse neural systems in future studies. We further show that this relationship can be generalized across different models and measures, implying a potentially fundamental link between network structure and coding strategy using spikes.

">Prefrontal and ventral striatal dendritic morphology: effects of life-long complex housing and amphetamine administration</a></h4>

              
                Complex housing is one of the most effective experiences in producing plastic changes in the brain. For example, animals living in complex environments show widespread synaptic changes both in cerebral cortex and the striatum. Similarly, repeatedly treating animals with psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamine also induces changes in prefrontal cortex and the striatum. The purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of life-long housing in complex environments versus standard laboratory caging and this experience influenced the later effects of amphetamine. Both male and female Long-Evans rats were placed in complex environments for about 110 days, beginning at conception, until adulthood at which time they were administered saline or amphetamine daily (1 mg/kg, IP) for 14 days. A week later the brains were harvested and processed for Golgi-Cox staining to analyze dendritic length, branching, and spine density in prefrontal cortex (areas Cg3 and AID) and Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc). The results showed that the prolonged period of enriched housing produced significant synaptic changes in all three measures in all three areas measured, but the effects differed in the two sexes. Amphetamine produced large synaptic changes in Cg3 and NAcc in males but only spine changes in those regions in females. Complex housing did not interact with the later effects of amphetamine administration. Thus, both complex housing and amphetamine can produce a range of synaptic changes depending upon sex and area examined. Furthermore, the effect of complex housing varies depending on the details of when complex housing is begun and how long it lasts.

">Newly discovered base barrier cells provide compartmentalization of choroid plexus, brain and CSF</a></h4>

              
                The choroid plexus (ChP) is a highly understudied structure of the central nervous system (CNS). The structure hangs in the brain ventricles, is composed of an epithelial cell layer, which produces the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forms the blood-CSF barrier. It encapsulates a stromal mix of fenestrated capillaries, fibroblasts and a broad range of immune cells. Here, we report that the ChP base region harbors unique fibroblasts that cluster together, are connected by tight junctions and seal the ChP stroma from brain and CSF, thereby forming ChP base barrier cells (ChP BBCs). ChP BBCs are derived from meningeal mesenchymal precursors, arrive early during embryonic development, are maintained throughout life and are conserved across species. Moreover, we provide transcriptional profiles and key markers to label ChP BBCs and observe a striking transcriptional similarity with meningeal arachnoid barrier cells (ABCs). Finally, we provide evidence that this fibroblast cluster functions as a barrier to control communication between CSF and the ChP stroma and between the latter and the brain parenchyma. Moreover, loss of barrier function was observed during an inflammatory insult. Altogether, we have identified a novel barrier that provides functional compartmentalization of ChP, brain and CSF.

                Despite abundant evidence of functional networks in the human brain, their neuronal underpinnings, and relationships to real-time behavior have been challenging to resolve. Analyzing brain-wide intracranial-EEG recordings with video monitoring, acquired in awake subjects during clinical epilepsy evaluation, we discovered the tendency of each brain region to switch back and forth between 2 distinct power spectral densities (PSDs 2-55Hz). We further recognized that this spectral switching occurs synchronously between distant sites, even between regions with differing baseline PSDs, revealing long-range functional networks that would be obscured in analysis of individual frequency bands. Moreover, the real-time PSD-switching dynamics of specific networks exhibited striking alignment with activities such as conversation and hand movements, revealing a multi-threaded functional network representation of concurrent naturalistic behaviors. Network structures and their relationships to behaviors were stable across days, but were altered during N3 sleep. Our results provide a new framework for understanding real-time, brain-wide neural-network dynamics.

">Mineral Phase Changes During Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Intervertebral disc disease is a common cause of pain and neurological deficits. The disease is known to be associated with degeneration and calcification of the disc, which often leads to herniation. However, the precise role of calcification in the pathology of the disease is poorly understood. Here we analysed samples of surgically collected herniated disc material, and compared it to material taken from non-herniated discs in the same animal, following surgical treatment of clinical cases in dogs. Our clinical approach to these cases means that we are ethically able to collect samples in a way which allows a unique opportunity for a case controlled study such as this, an opportunity which is not available to the human neurosurgeon. We analysed all samples using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, as well as a proportion with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FTIR spectra of the majority of herniated samples were consistent with the presence of crystalline hydroxyapatite, whereas most of the non-herniated discs showed spectra consistent with amorphous phosphate material. XRD analysis and TEM confirmed these findings and identified the amorphous material as amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticle clusters of ~ 20 nm diameter and the crystalline hydroxyapatite material as needles up to 100 nm in length. The difference in mineral phases and particle shape between the herniated and non-herniated discs indicate that the degenerative process may involve a conversion of amorphous calcium phosphate into crystalline hydroxyapatite. This conversion precedes and may predispose the disc to herniate. Further work is needed to identify the pathway of this mineral phase transformation and could lead to treatments to halt this process.

Arginase-1 (Arg1) is conventionally understood as a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages, associated with the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair in various pathological conditions. However, its specific role in post-stroke recovery remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the functional impact of Arg1 expressed in macrophages on post-stroke recovery and inflammatory milieu. We observed a time-dependent increase in Arg1 expression, peaking at 7 days after photothrombotic stroke in mice. Cellular mapping analysis revealed that Arg1 was predominantly expressed in LysM-positive infiltrating macrophages. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we examined the role of Arg1 expressed in infiltrating macrophages. Contrary to its presumed beneficial effects, Arg1 cKO in LysM-positive macrophages significantly improved skilled forelimb motor function recovery after stroke. Mechanistically, Arg1 cKO attenuated fibrotic scar formation, enhanced peri-infarct remyelination, and increased synaptic density while reducing microglial synaptic elimination in the peri-infarct cortex. Gene expression analysis of FACS-sorted microglia revealed decreased TGF-beta signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine activity in peri-infarct microglia from Arg1 cKO animals. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that Arg1 activity in macrophages modulates microglial synaptic phagocytosis, providing evidence for macrophage-microglia interaction. These findings provide new insights into Arg1 function in CNS injury and highlight an interaction between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia in shaping the post-stroke inflammatory milieu. Our study identifies Arg1 in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for modulating post-stroke inflammation and improving functional recovery.

">Dynamic control of neural manifolds</a></h4>

              
                In the central nervous system, sequences of neural activity form trajectories on low dimensional neural manifolds. The neural computation underlying flexible cognition and behavior relies on dynamic control of these structures. For example different tasks or behaviors are represented on different subspaces, requiring fast timescale subspace rotation to move from one behavior to the next. For flexibility in a particular behavior, the neural trajectory must be dynamically controllable within that behaviorally determined subspace. To understand how dynamic control of neural trajectories and their underlying subspaces may be implemented in neural circuits, we first characterized the relationship between features of neural activity sequences and aspects of the low dimensional projection. Based on this, we propose neural mechanisms that can act within local circuits to modulate activity sequences thereby controlling neural trajectories in low dimensional subspaces. In particular, we show that gain modulation and transient synaptic currents control the speed and path of neural trajectories and clustered inhibition determines manifold orientation. Together, these neural mechanisms may enable a substrate for fast timescale computation on neural manifolds.

">Translating human drug use patterns into rat models: exploring spontaneous interindividual differences via refined drug self-administration procedures</a></h4>

              
                Users of heroin and cocaine self-regulate the dosage and frequency of administration to experience drugs' rewarding effects and avoid withdrawal. In contrast, most preclinical self-administration and choice procedures use experimenter-imposed unit-doses and timeout after infusions. Here, we introduce a no-timeout procedure that overcomes this limitation. We analyzed the heroin and cocaine taking- and seeking-patterns and estimated drug-brain levels in the presence or absence of timeout between drug injections. We further assessed the effect of timeout and drug or social peer access time on drug preference. Removing the timeout had a profound effect on pattern of heroin taking and seeking, promoting the emergence of burst-like drug intake. Timeout removal had a modest effect on cocaine taking and seeking. Drug or social peer access time increased heroin but not cocaine preference. Removal of timeout during self-administration and increasing the access time during choice resulted in a self-administration procedure that more closely mimic human heroin intake, offering a platform to identify novel medications.

">High-speed three-dimensional random access scanning with SPARCLS</a></h4>

              
                High-speed volumetric imaging is crucial for observing fast and distributed processes such as neuronal activity. Multiphoton microscopy helps to mitigate scattering effects inside tissue, but the standard raster scanning approach limits achievable volume rates. Random-access scanning can lead to a considerable speed-up by sampling only pre-selected locations, but existing techniques based on acousto-optic deflectors are still limited to a point rate of up to ~50 kHz. This limits the number of parallel targets at the high acquisition rates necessary, for example, in voltage imaging or imaging of fast synaptic events. Here we introduce SPARCLS, a method for 3D random-access scanning at up to 340 kHz point rate using a single 1D phase modulator. We show the potential of this method by imaging synaptic events with fluorescent glutamate sensors in mammalian organotypic slices as well as in zebrafish larvae.

">Interoceptive Signals Bias Decision Making in Rhesus Macaques</a></h4>

              
                Several influential theories have proposed that interoceptive signals, sent from the body to the brain, contribute to neural processes that coordinate complex behaviors. Using pharmacological agents that do not cross the blood-brain barrier, we altered interoceptive states and evaluated their effect on decision-making in rhesus monkeys. We used glycopyrrolate, a non-specific muscarinic (parasympathetic) antagonist, and isoproterenol, a beta-1/2 (sympathetic) agonist, to create a sympathetic-dominated physiological state indexed by increased heart rate. Rhesus monkeys were trained on two variants of an approach-avoidance conflict task, where they chose between enduring mildly aversive stimuli in exchange for a steady flow of rewards, or cancelling the aversive stimuli, forgoing the rewards. The delay to interrupt the aversive stimuli and the reward were used as a measure of the cost-benefit estimation that drove the monkeys' decisions. Both drugs altered approach-avoidance decisions, substantially reducing the delay to interrupt the aversive stimuli. To determine whether this autonomic state lowered tolerance to aversive stimuli or reduced the subjective value of the reward, we tested the effects of glycopyrrolate on a food preference task. Food preference was unaltered, suggesting that the sympathetic dominated state selectively reduces tolerance for aversive stimuli without altering reward-seeking behaviors. As these drugs have no direct effect on brain physiology, interoceptive afferents are the most likely mechanism by which decision making was biased toward avoidance.

">Cell-Type-Specific Regulation of Cocaine Reward by the E2F3a Transcription Factor in Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                The development of drug addiction is characterized by molecular changes in brain reward regions that lead to the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use. These neurobiological processes in brain reward regions, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), are orchestrated in large part by transcriptional regulation. Our group recently identified the transcription factor E2F3a as a novel regulator of cocaine's rewarding effects and gene expression regulation in the NAc of male mice. Despite this progress, no information is available about the role of E2F3a in regulating cocaine reward at the sex- and cell-specific levels. Here, we used male and female mice expressing Cre-recombinase in either D1- or D2-type medium spiny neurons (MSNs) combined with viral-mediated gene transfer to bidirectionally control levels of E2F3a in a cell-type-specific manner in the NAc during conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine. Our findings show that selective overexpression of E2F3a in D1-MSNs increased cocaine CPP in both male and female mice, whereas opposite effects were observed under knockdown conditions. In contrast, equivalent E2F3a manipulations in D2-MSNs had no significant effects. To further explore the role of E2F3a in sophisticated operant and motivated behaviors, we performed viral manipulations of all NAc neurons in combination with cocaine self-administration and behavioral economics procedures in rats and demonstrated that E2F3a regulates sensitivity aspects of cocaine seeking and taking. These results confirm E2F3a as a central substrate of cocaine reward and demonstrate that this effect is mediated in D1-MSNs, thereby providing increased knowledge of cocaine action at the transcriptional level.

">A multi-region recurrent circuit for evidence accumulation in rats</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making based on noisy evidence requires accumulating evidence and categorizing it to form a choice. Here we evaluate a proposed feedforward and modular mapping of this process in rats: evidence accumulated in anterodorsal striatum (ADS) is categorized in prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). Contrary to this, we show that both regions appear to be indistinguishable in their encoding/decoding of accumulator value and communicate this information bidirectionally. Consistent with a role for FOF in accumulation, silencing FOF to ADS projections impacted behavior throughout the accumulation period, even while nonselective FOF silencing did not. We synthesize these findings into a multi-region recurrent neural network trained with a novel approach. In-silico experiments reveal that multiple scales of recurrence in the cortico-striatal circuit rescue computation upon nonselective FOF perturbations. These results suggest that ADS and FOF accumulate evidence in a recurrent and distributed manner, yielding redundant representations and robustness to certain perturbations.

">Degradation in Binaural and Spatial Hearing and Auditory Temporal Processing Abilities as a Function of Aging</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Sensorineural hearing loss is common with advancing age, but even when hearing is normal or near normal in older persons, performance deficits are often seen for suprathreshold listening tasks such as understanding speech in background noise or localizing the direction sounds are coming from. This suggests there is also a more central source of the problem. Objectives of this study were to examine as a function of age (young adult to septuagenarian) performance on: 1) a spatial acuity task examining lateralization ability, and a spatial speech-in-noise (SSIN) recognition task, both measured in a hemi-anechoic sound field using a circular horizontal-plane loudspeaker array, and 2) a suprathreshold auditory temporal processing task and a spectro-temporal processing task, both measured under headphones. Further, we examined any correlations between the measures. Design: Subjects were 48 adults, aged 21 to 78, with either normal hearing or only a mild sensorineural hearing loss through 4000 Hz. The lateralization task measured minimum audible angle (MAA) for 500 and 4000 Hz narrowband noise (NBN) bursts in diffuse background noise for both an on-axis (subject facing 0{ring}) and off-axis (facing 45{ring}) listening condition at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -3, -6, -9, and -12 dB. For 42 of the subjects, SSIN testing was also completed for key word recognition in sentences in multi-talker babble noise; specifically, the separation between speech and noise loudspeakers was adaptively varied to determine the difference needed for 40% and 80% correct performance levels. Finally, auditory temporal processing ability was examined using the Temporal Fine Structure test (44 subjects), and the Spectro-Temporal Modulation test (46 subjects). Results: Mean lateralization performances were poorer (larger MAAs) in older compared to younger subjects, particularly in the more adverse listening conditions (i.e., for 4000 Hz, off-axis, and at poorer SNRs). Performance variability was notably higher for older subjects than for young adults. The 4000 Hz NBN bursts produced larger MAAs than did 500 Hz NBN bursts. The SSIN data also showed declining mean performance with age at both criterion levels, with greater variability again found for older subjects. Spearman rho analyses revealed some low to moderate, but significant correlation coefficients for age versus MAA and for age versus SSIN results. Results from both the TFS and STM showed decreased mean performance with aging, and revealed moderate, significant correlations, with the strongest relationship shown with the TFS test. Finally, of note, extended-high-frequency (EHF) hearing loss (measured between 9000 and 16,000 Hz) was found to increase with aging, but was not seen in the young adult subjects. Conclusions: Particularly for more adverse listening conditions, age-related deficits were found on both of the spatial hearing tasks and in temporal and spectro-temporal processing abilities. It may be that deficits in temporal processing ability contribute to poorer spatial hearing performance in older subjects due to inaccurate coding of binaural/interaural timing information sent from the periphery to the brainstem. In addition, EHF hearing loss may be a coexisting factor that impacts performance in older subjects.

">Aberrant remodelling of astrocytic architecture in acute hepatic encephalopathy: complexity of oedematic atrophic astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) following acute liver failure (ALF) is a primary toxic astrocytopathy, although in-depth characterisation of underlying pathogenesis is far from complete. Among the multitude of astrocyte-specific proteins guiding brain functionality, plasmalemma-cytoskeletal linker ezrin, actin-binding protein profilin-1, and water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) contribute to astrocytic morphological plasticity through regulation of cell shape, volume, complexity of primary and terminal processes, and positioning astrocytes against other CNS constituents. Changes in these proteins might contribute to the brain oedema and astrocytic morphological remodelling in the HE. Using transmission electron microscopy, confocal fluorescent microscopy, and 3D reconstruction, we found complex morphological alterations of cortical astrocytes in mice with azoxymethane-induced ALF. Astrocytic primary branches demonstrated hypertrophy, whereas terminal leaflets showed atrophy quantified by the reduced area occupied by astrocytes, decreased number and the length of leaflets, decreased leaflets volume fraction, and altered astrocyte-to-neurone landscape. These morphological changes correlat with decreased expression of AQP4, phosphorylated leaflet-associated ezrin, and the actin dynamics regulator, profilin 1, suggesting the contribution of these proteins to astrocytic pathological remodelling. Pathological changes in astrocytes develop in parallel, and are likely causally linked to, the HE-linked neurological decline, manifested by a reduction in electroencephalography power and by excessive glutamate in the brain microdialysates.

	<p>The purpose of our study was to obtain evidence that an unsupervised tele-exercise program (TEgroup) via an online platform is a feasible alternative to a hybrid mode of supervised and unsupervised exercise (HEgroup) sessions for improving fitness indexes, respiratory and cognitive functions, and biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients recovering from COVID-19. Forty-nine patients with long post-COVID-19 were randomly divided into two groups (HEgroup: n = 24, age 60.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5 years versus TEgroup: n = 25, age 58.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5 years). For each patient, we collected data from body composition, oxidative stress, pulmonary function, physical fitness, and cognitive function before and after the 12-week exercise rehabilitation program (ERP). Our data showed differences in both groups before and after 12-week ERP on fitness indicators, body composition, and pulmonary function indicators. Our findings demonstrated differences between groups after 12-week ERP on adjustment in the domains of cognitive function (HEgroup increased the &amp;amp;ldquo;visuospatial&amp;amp;rdquo; domain: 3.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.1 versus 3.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.8 score, p = 0.008 and TEgroup increased the &amp;amp;ldquo;memory&amp;amp;rdquo; domain: 3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0 versus 3.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.5 score, p = 0.003; after 12-week ERP showed differences between groups in domain &amp;amp;ldquo;attention&amp;amp;rdquo; TEgroup: 4.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 versus HEgroup: 3.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 score, p = 0.014) and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (HEgroup increased the percent of predicted values at 0.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 32.3% and TEgroup at 26.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.1%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings may be attributed to the different ways of learning exercise programs, resulting in the recruitment of different neural circuits.</p>

	<p>Persons with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) often experience limitations in their quality of life (QoL). Some studies have shown positive effects of speech and language therapy on QoL in persons with PPA. However, there is still a lack of evidence for disorder-specific approaches for this important therapeutic goal. The biographic-narrative approach (narraktiv) has been shown to significantly improve QoL in persons with post-stroke aphasia. In the planned study, the biographic-narrative approach will be adapted for persons with PPA (Cope PPA), and its efficacy will be investigated. First, a focus group interview with five persons with PPA will be conducted to identify the wishes and needs of participants. Based on the results, the narraktiv manual according to Corsten et al. (2015) will be revised. Second, an efficacy study will be conducted according to the new Cope PPA manual with 24 persons with PPA in a waiting group control design. The primary outcome, QoL, will be assessed using questionnaires (Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39) and semistructured interviews. Depressive symptoms, life satisfaction and cognitive/communicative functioning will also be assessed. If Cope PPA proves efficacy, this study may help to improve the treatment of persons with PPA.</p>

	<p>Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease that affects the Central Nervous System by causing demyelination. Social cognition (SC) deficits are common among individuals with MS and can significantly impact their quality of life (QoL) due to difficulties in interpreting social cues and establishing meaningful relationships. Objective: This scoping review aimed to investigate SC in subjects with MS and its impact on QoL. Methods: Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. After reading the full text of the selected studies and applying predefined inclusion criteria, four studies were included based on pertinence and relevance to the topic. Results: The findings highlight significant associations between SC deficits, social support, fatigue, and QoL outcomes. Cognitive decline was identified as a predictive factor for SC impairment in the MS population, which affects daily activities and relationships, thereby reducing QoL. Moreover, emotional impairments such as depression and anxiety exacerbate these challenges. Enhancing social support networks may improve psychological well-being and disease management in MS. Conclusions: Although evidence is limited, assessing SC is crucial in the care pathways for MS to develop tailored psychosocial interventions that address the cognitive, emotional, and social facets of the disease, thereby improving overall outcomes and QoL.</p>

                <p>Dysregulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and oligodendrocyte differentiation contribute to failure of remyelination in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Deletion of muscarinic receptor enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. However, the role of ligand-dependent signaling versus constitutive receptor activation is unknown. We hypothesized that dysregulated acetylcholine (ACh) release upon demyelination contributes to ligand-mediated activation hindering myelin repair. Following chronic cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination (male and female mice), we observed a 2.5-fold increase in ACh concentration. This increase in ACh concentration could be attributed to increased ACh synthesis or decreased acetylcholinesterase-/butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-mediated degradation. Using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) reporter mice, we identified increased ChAT-GFP expression following both lysolecithin and CPZ demyelination. ChAT-GFP expression was upregulated in a subset of injured and uninjured axons following intraspinal lysolecithin-induced demyelination. In CPZ-demyelinated corpus callosum, ChAT-GFP was observed in Gfap<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and axons indicating the potential for neuronal and astrocytic ACh release. <I>BChE</I> expression was significantly decreased in the corpus callosum following CPZ demyelination. This decrease was due to the loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes which were the primary source of BChE. To determine the role of ligand-mediated muscarinic signaling following lysolecithin injection, we administered neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, to artificially raise ACh. We identified a dose-dependent decrease in mature oligodendrocyte density with no effect on OPC recruitment. Together, these results support a functional role of ligand-mediated activation of muscarinic receptors following demyelination and suggest that dysregulation of ACh homeostasis directly contributes to failure of remyelination in MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e0060242024?rss=1">Trying Harder: How Cognitive Effort Sculpts Neural Representations during Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the exertion of mental effort improves performance on cognitive tasks, the neural mechanisms by which motivational factors impact cognition remain unknown. Here, we used fMRI to test how changes in cognitive effort, induced by changes in task difficulty, impact neural representations of working memory (WM). Participants (both sexes) were precued whether WM difficulty would be hard or easy. We hypothesized that hard trials demanded more effort as a later decision required finer mnemonic precision. Behaviorally, pupil size was larger and response times were slower on hard compared with easy trials suggesting our manipulation of effort succeeded. Neurally, we observed robust persistent activity during delay periods in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially during hard trials. Yet, details of the memoranda could not be decoded from patterns in prefrontal activity. In the patterns of activity in the visual cortex, however, we found strong decoding of memorized targets, where accuracy was higher on hard trials. To potentially link these across-region effects, we hypothesized that effort, carried by persistent activity in the PFC, impacts the quality of WM representations encoded in the visual cortex. Indeed, we found that the amplitude of delay period activity in the frontal cortex predicted decoded accuracy in the visual cortex on a trial-wise basis. These results indicate that effort-related feedback signals sculpt population activity in the visual cortex, improving mnemonic fidelity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e0222242024?rss=1">Obesity Alters POMC and Kisspeptin Neuron Cross Talk Leading to Reduced Luteinizing Hormone in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Obesity is associated with hypogonadism in males, characterized by low testosterone and sperm number. Previous studies determined that these stem from dysregulation of hypothalamic circuitry that regulates reproduction, by unknown mechanisms. Herein, we used mice fed chronic high-fat diet, which mimics human obesity, to determine mechanisms of impairment at the level of the hypothalamus, in particular gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that regulate luteinizing hormone (LH), which then regulates testosterone. Consistent with obese humans, we demonstrated lower LH, and lower pulse frequency of LH secretion, but unchanged pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. LH pulse frequency is regulated by pulsatile GnRH secretion, which is controlled by kisspeptin. Peripheral and central kisspeptin injections, and DREADD-mediated activation of kisspeptin neurons, demonstrated that kisspeptin neurons were suppressed in obese mice. Thus, we investigated regulators of kisspeptin secretion. We determined that the LH response to NMDA was lower in obese mice, corresponding to fewer glutamate receptors in kisspeptin neurons, which may be critical for kisspeptin synchronization. Given that kisspeptin neurons also interact with anorexigenic POMC neurons, which are affected by obesity, we examined their cross talk, and determined that the LH response to either DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons or central injection of &alpha;MSH, a product of POMC, is abolished in obese mice. This was accompanied by diminished levels of &alpha;MSH receptor, MC4R, in kisspeptin neurons. Together, our studies determined that obesity leads to the downregulation of receptors that regulate kisspeptin neurons, which is associated with lower LH pulse frequency, leading to lower LH and hypogonadism.</p>

                <p>Interspecies comparisons are key to deriving an understanding of the behavioral and neural correlates of human cognition from animal models. We perform a detailed comparison of the strategies of female macaque monkeys to male and female humans on a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a widely studied and applied task that provides a multiattribute measure of cognitive function and depends on the frontal lobe. WCST performance requires the inference of a rule change given ambiguous feedback. We found that well-trained monkeys infer new rules three times more slowly than minimally instructed humans. Input-dependent hidden Markov model&ndash;generalized linear models were fit to their choices, revealing hidden states akin to feature-based attention in both species. Decision processes resembled a win&ndash;stay, lose&ndash;shift strategy with interspecies similarities as well as key differences. Monkeys and humans both test multiple rule hypotheses over a series of rule-search trials and perform inference-like computations to exclude candidate choice options. We quantitatively show that perseveration, random exploration, and poor sensitivity to negative feedback account for the slower task-switching performance in monkeys.</p>

                <p>SLURP1 and SLURP2 are both small secreted members of the Ly6/u-PAR family of proteins and are highly expressed in keratinocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in SLURP1 lead to a rare autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), Mal de Meleda (MdM), which is characterized by diffuse, yellowish palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Some individuals with MdM experience pain in conjunction with the hyperkeratosis that has been attributed to fissures or microbial superinfection within the affected skin. By comparison, other hereditary PPKs such as pachyonychia congenita and Olmsted syndrome show prevalent pain in PPK lesions. Two mouse models of MdM, Slurp1 knock-out and Slurp2X knock-out, exhibit robust PPK in all four paws. However, whether the sensory experience of these animals includes augmented pain sensitivity remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that both models exhibit hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli as well as spontaneous pain behaviors in males and females. Anatomical analysis revealed slightly reduced glabrous skin epidermal innervation and substantial alterations in palmoplantar skin immune composition in Slurp2X knock-out mice. Primary sensory neurons innervating hindpaw glabrous skin from Slurp2X knock-out mice exhibit increased incidence of spontaneous activity and mechanical hypersensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Slurp knock-out mice exhibit polymodal PPK-associated pain that is associated with both immune alterations and neuronal hyperexcitability and might therefore be useful for the identification of therapeutic targets to treat PPK-associated pain.</p>

                <p>Shank3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein that assists in tethering and organizing structural proteins and glutamatergic receptors in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. The localization of Shank3 at excitatory synapses and the formation of stable Shank3 complexes is regulated by the binding of zinc to the C-terminal sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domain of Shank3. Mutations in the SAM domain of Shank3 result in altered synaptic function and morphology, and disruption of zinc in synapses that express Shank3 leads to a reduction of postsynaptic proteins important for synaptic structure and function. This suggests that zinc supports the localization of postsynaptic proteins via Shank3. Many regions of the brain are highly enriched with free zinc inside glutamatergic vesicles at presynaptic terminals. At these synapses, zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) moves zinc into vesicles where it is co-released with glutamate. Alterations in ZnT3 are implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, and ZnT3 knock-out (KO) mice&mdash;which lack synaptic zinc&mdash;show behavioral deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Here we show that male and female ZnT3 KO mice have smaller dendritic spines and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes than wildtype (WT) mice in the auditory cortex. Additionally, spine size deficits in ZnT3 KO mice are restricted to synapses that express Shank3. In WT mice, synapses that express both Shank3 and ZnT3 have larger spines compared to synapses that express Shank3 but not ZnT3. Together these findings suggest a mechanism whereby presynaptic ZnT3-dependent zinc supports postsynaptic structure and function via Shank3 in a synapse-specific manner.</p>

                <p>Temporal prediction assists language comprehension. In a series of recent behavioral studies, we have shown that listeners specifically employ rhythmic modulations of prosody to estimate the duration of upcoming sentences, thereby speeding up comprehension. In the current human magnetoencephalography (MEG) study on participants of either sex, we show that the human brain achieves this function through a mechanism termed entrainment. Through entrainment, electrophysiological brain activity maintains and continues contextual rhythms beyond their offset. Our experiment combined exposure to repetitive prosodic contours with the subsequent presentation of visual sentences that either matched or mismatched the duration of the preceding contour. During exposure to prosodic contours, we observed MEG coherence with the contours, which was source-localized to right-hemispheric auditory areas. During the processing of the visual targets, activity at the frequency of the preceding contour was still detectable in the MEG; yet sources shifted to the (left) frontal cortex, in line with a functional inheritance of the rhythmic acoustic context for prediction. Strikingly, when the target sentence was shorter than expected from the preceding contour, an omission response appeared in the evoked potential record. We conclude that prosodic entrainment is a functional mechanism of temporal prediction in language comprehension. In general, acoustic rhythms appear to endow language for employing the brain's electrophysiological mechanisms of temporal prediction.</p>

                <p>Tau pathologies are detected in the brains of some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau proteins are expressed in six isoforms with either three or four microtubule-binding repeats (3R tau or 4R tau) due to alternative RNA splicing. AD, LBD, and CTE brains contain pathological deposits of both 3R and 4R tau. FTD patients can exhibit either 4R tau pathologies in most cases or 3R tau pathologies less commonly in Pick's disease, which is a subfamily of FTD. Here, we report the isoform-specific roles of tau in FTD. The P301L mutation, linked to familial 4R tau FTD, induces mislocalization of 4R tau to dendritic spines in primary hippocampal cultures that were prepared from neonatal rat pups of both sexes. Contrastingly, the G272V mutation, linked to familial Pick's disease, induces phosphorylation-dependent mislocalization of 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins to dendritic spines. The overexpression of G272V 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins leads to the reduction of dendritic spine density and suppression of mEPSCs in 5-week-old primary rat hippocampal cultures. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude caused by G272V 3R tau is dynamin-dependent whereas that caused by P301L 4R tau is dynamin-independent, indicating that the two tau isoforms activate different signaling pathways responsible for excitatory synaptic dysfunction. Our 3R and 4R tau studies here will shed new light on diverse mechanisms underlying FTD, AD, LBD, and CTE.</p>

                <p>The vagal ganglia, comprised of the superior (jugular) and inferior (nodose) ganglia of the vagus nerve, receive somatosensory information from the head and neck or viscerosensory information from the inner organs, respectively. Developmentally, the cranial neural crest gives rise to all vagal glial cells and to neurons of the jugular ganglia, while the epibranchial placode gives rise to neurons of the nodose ganglia. Crest-derived nodose glial progenitors can additionally generate autonomic neurons in the peripheral nervous system, but how these progenitors generate neurons is unknown. Here, we found that some Sox10+ neural crest-derived cells in, and surrounding, the nodose ganglion transiently expressed Phox2b, a master regulator of autonomic nervous system development, during early embryonic life. Our genetic lineage-tracing analysis in mice of either sex revealed that despite their common developmental origin and extreme spatial proximity, a substantial proportion of glial cells in the nodose, but not in the neighboring jugular ganglia, have a history of Phox2b expression. We used single-cell RNA&ndash;sequencing to demonstrate that these progenitors give rise to all major glial subtypes in the nodose ganglia, including Schwann cells, satellite glia, and glial precursors, and mapped their spatial distribution by in situ hybridization. Lastly, integration analysis revealed transcriptomic similarities between nodose and dorsal root ganglia glial subtypes and revealed immature nodose glial subtypes. Our work demonstrates that these crest-derived nodose glial progenitors transiently express Phox2b, give rise to the entire complement of nodose glial cells, and display a transcriptional program that may underlie their bipotent nature.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) may be crucial to working memory (WM). Computational models predict that they sustain neural firing and produce associative memory, which may underpin maintaining and binding information, respectively. We test this in patients with antibodies to NMDAR (<I>n</I> = 10, female) and compare them with healthy control participants (<I>n</I> = 55, 20 male, 35 female). Patients were tested after recovery with a task that separates two aspects of WM: sustaining attention and feature binding. Participants had to remember two colored arrows. Then attention was directed to one of them. After a variable delay, they reported the direction of either the same arrow (congruent cue) or of the other arrow (incongruent cue). We asked how congruency affected recall precision and measured types of error. Patients had difficulty in both sustaining attention to an item over time and feature binding. Controls were less precise after longer delays and incongruent cues. In contrast, patients did not benefit from congruent cues at longer delays [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> congruency (long condition); <I>p</I> = 0.041], indicating they could not sustain attention. Additionally, patients reported the wrong item (misbinding errors) more than controls after congruent cues [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> delay (congruent condition), main effect of group; <I>p </I>&le; 0.001]. Our results suggest NMDARs are critical for both maintaining attention and feature binding.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e1653232024?rss=1">Dissociated Representation of Binaural Cues in Single-Sided Deafness: Implications for Cochlear Implantation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Congenital single-sided deafness (SSD) leads to an aural preference syndrome that is characterized by overrepresentation of the hearing ear in the auditory system. Cochlear implantation (CI) of the deaf ear is an effective treatment for SSD. However, the newly introduced auditory input in congenital SSD often does not reach expectations in late-implanted CI recipients with respect to binaural hearing and speech perception. In a previous study, a reduction of the interaural time difference (ITD) sensitivity has been shown in unilaterally congenitally deaf cats (uCDCs). In the present study, we focused on the interaural level difference (ILD) processing in the primary auditory cortex. The uCDC group was compared with hearing cats (HCs) and bilaterally congenitally deaf cats (CDCs). The ILD representation was reorganized, replacing the preference for the contralateral ear with a preference for the hearing ear, regardless of the cortical hemisphere. In accordance with the previous study, uCDCs were less sensitive to interaural time differences than HCs, resulting in unmodulated ITD responses, thus lacking directional information. Such incongruent ITDs and ILDs cannot be integrated for binaural sound source localization. In normal hearing, the predominant effect of each ear is excitation of the auditory cortex in the contralateral cortical hemisphere and inhibition in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In SSD, however, auditory pathways reorganized such that the hearing ear produced greater excitation in both cortical hemispheres and the deaf ear produced weaker excitation and preserved inhibition in both cortical hemispheres.</p>

                <p>Chronic sleep disruption (CSD), from insufficient or fragmented sleep and is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Underlying mechanisms are not understood. CSD in mice results in degeneration of locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) and CA1 hippocampal neurons and increases hippocampal amyloid-&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> (A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB>), entorhinal cortex (EC) tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and glial reactivity. LCn injury is increasingly implicated in AD pathogenesis. CSD increases NE turnover in LCn, and LCn norepinephrine (NE) metabolism activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), an enzyme known to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau into neurotoxic fragments. We hypothesized that CSD would activate LCn AEP in an NE-dependent manner to induce LCn and hippocampal injury. Here, we studied LCn, hippocampal, and EC responses to CSD in mice deficient in NE [dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase (<I>Dbh</I>)<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>] and control male and female mice, using a model of chronic fragmentation of sleep (CFS). Sleep was equally fragmented in <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and control male and female mice, yet only <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice conferred resistance to CFS loss of LCn, LCn p-tau, and LCn AEP upregulation and activation as evidenced by an increase in AEP-cleaved APP and tau fragments. Absence of NE also prevented a CFS increase in hippocampal AEP-APP and A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> but did not prevent CFS-increased AEP-tau and p-tau in the EC. Collectively, this work demonstrates AEP activation by CFS, establishes key roles for NE in both CFS degeneration of LCn neurons and CFS promotion of forebrain A&beta; accumulation, and, thereby, identifies a key molecular link between CSD and specific AD neural injuries.</p>

                <p>The zebrafish, a widely used model in neurobiology, relies on hearing in aquatic environments. Unfortunately, its auditory pathways have mainly been studied in larvae. In this study, we examined the involvement of the anterior tuberal nucleus (AT) in auditory processing in adult zebrafish. Our tract-tracing experiments revealed that the dorsal subdivision of AT is strongly bidirectionally connected to the central nucleus of the torus semicircularis (TSc), a major auditory nucleus in fishes. Immunohistochemical visualization of the ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) phosphorylation to map neural activity in response to auditory stimulation substantiated this finding: the dorsal but not the ventral part of AT responded strongly to auditory stimulation. A similar response to auditory stimulation was present in the TSc but not in the nucleus isthmi, a visual region, which we used as a control for testing if the pS6 activation was specific to the auditory stimulation. We also measured the time course of pS6 phosphorylation, which was previously unreported in teleost fish. After auditory stimulation, we found that pS6 phosphorylation peaked between 100 and 130&nbsp;min and returned to baseline levels after 190&nbsp;min. This information will be valuable for the design of future pS6 experiments. Our results suggest an anatomical and functional subdivision of AT, where only the dorsal part connects to the auditory network and processes auditory information.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy is often comorbid with psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Despite the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, few studies address the underlying mechanisms. Stress can trigger epilepsy and depression. Evidence from human and animal studies supports that hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to both disorders and their comorbidity (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B16">Kanner, 2003</cross-ref>). Here, we investigate if HPA axis dysfunction may influence epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. We generated a novel mouse model (<I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice) lacking the K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter, KCC2, in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which exhibit stress- and seizure-induced HPA axis hyperactivation (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Melon et al., 2018</cross-ref>). We used the <I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice to examine the impact on epilepsy outcomes, including seizure frequency/burden, comorbid behavioral deficits, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. We found sex differences in HPA axis dysfunction&rsquo;s effect on chronically epileptic KCC2/Crh KO mice seizure burden, vulnerability to comorbid behavioral deficits, and SUDEP. Suppressing HPA axis hyperexcitability in this model using pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches decreased SUDEP incidence, suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction may contribute to SUDEP. Altered neuroendocrine markers were present in SUDEP cases compared with people with epilepsy or individuals without epilepsy. Together, these findings implicate HPA axis dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and SUDEP.</p>

                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

                <p>by Andrew A. Chen, Kelly Clark, Blake E. Dewey, Anna DuVal, Nicole Pellegrini, Govind Nair, Youmna Jalkh, Samar Khalil, Jon Zurawski, Peter A. Calabresi, Daniel S.

Dimension reduction tools preserving similarity and graph structure such as <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP can capture complex biological patterns in high-dimensional data. However, these tools typically are not designed to separate effects of interest from unwanted effects due to confounders. We introduce the partial embedding (PARE) framework, which enables removal of confounders from any distance-based dimension reduction method. We then develop partial <i>t</i>-SNE and partial UMAP and apply these methods to genomic and neuroimaging data. For lower-dimensional visualization, our results show that the PARE framework can remove batch effects in single-cell sequencing data as well as separate clinical and technical variability in neuroimaging measures. We demonstrate that the PARE framework extends dimension reduction methods to highlight biological patterns of interest while effectively removing confounding effects.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012240">Jointly efficient encoding and decoding in neural populations</a></h4>

The efficient coding approach proposes that neural systems represent as much sensory information as biological constraints allow. It aims at formalizing encoding as a constrained optimal process. A different approach, that aims at formalizing decoding, proposes that neural systems instantiate a generative model of the sensory world. Here, we put forth a normative framework that characterizes neural systems as jointly optimizing encoding and decoding. It takes the form of a variational autoencoder: sensory stimuli are encoded in the noisy activity of neurons to be interpreted by a flexible decoder; encoding must allow for an accurate stimulus reconstruction from neural activity. Jointly, neural activity is required to represent the statistics of latent features which are mapped by the decoder into distributions over sensory stimuli; decoding correspondingly optimizes the accuracy of the generative model. This framework yields in a family of encoding-decoding models, which result in equally accurate generative models, indexed by a measure of the stimulus-induced deviation of neural activity from the marginal distribution over neural activity. Each member of this family predicts a specific relation between properties of the sensory neurons—such as the arrangement of the tuning curve means (preferred stimuli) and widths (degrees of selectivity) in the population—as a function of the statistics of the sensory world. Our approach thus generalizes the efficient coding approach. Notably, here, the form of the constraint on the optimization derives from the requirement of an accurate generative model, while it is arbitrary in efficient coding models. Moreover, solutions do not require the knowledge of the stimulus distribution, but are learned on the basis of data samples; the constraint further acts as regularizer, allowing the model to generalize beyond the training data. Finally, we characterize the family of models we obtain through alternate measures of performance, such as the error in stimulus reconstruction. We find that a range of models admits comparable performance; in particular, a population of sensory neurons with broad tuning curves as observed experimentally yields both low reconstruction stimulus error and an accurate generative model that generalizes robustly to unseen data.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002655">A molecularly defined subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes during postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shayan Moghimyfiroozabad, Maela A. Paul, Lea Bellenger, Fekrije Selimi</p>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a class of glial cells that uniformly tiles the entire central nervous system (CNS). They play several key functions across the brain including the generation of oligodendrocytes and the control of myelination. Whether the functional diversity of OPCs is the result of genetically defined subpopulations or of their regulation by external factors has not been definitely established. We discovered that a subpopulation of OPCs found across the brain is defined by the expression of <i>C1ql1</i>, a gene previously described for its synaptic function in neurons. This subpopulation starts to appear during the first postnatal week in the mouse cortex. Ablation of <i>C1ql1</i>-expressing OPCs in the mouse leads to a massive lack of oligodendrocytes and myelination in many brain regions. This deficit cannot be rescued, even though some OPCs escape <i>Sox10</i>-driven ablation and end up partially compensating the OPC loss in the adult. Therefore, <i>C1ql1</i> is a molecular marker of a functionally non-redundant subpopulation of OPCs, which controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

                Introduction Getting acceptable cosmetic results in the soft tissues of the face serves as the foundation for orthodontic treatment planning. Also, in order to achieve healthy static and dynamic occlusal interactions, the teeth must be positioned within the basal bone at the correct position, angle, and inclination. To avoid periodontal issues, provide stability, and achieve a functional occlusion, it is essential to ascertain the individual’s dental arch form before starting of treatment and thus to utilise the mechanics that follow throughout the treatment. Objectives To evaluate and compare variation in Curve of Spee and Curve of Wilson in Class II Div.-1, Class II-Div-2 and Class-III as against Class I malocclusion in central India population. Methodology Irreversible hydrocolloid impression will be taken with perforated metal stock trays and stone cast will be poured. This will be scanned using CAD CAM machine and curve of Spee and Wilson will be measured using reverse engineering. Expected Result It will assist us in treatment planning for preventing periodontal issues, assuring stability, and achieving functional occlusion by evaluating and comparing the Spee and Wilson curves in Class II Divison-1, Class II Divison-2, and Class-III malocclusion with Class-I malocclusion. Conclusion Every single patient receiving orthodontic treatment has the COS, which is crucial to achieving a stable occlusion. Almost every patient who receives orthodontic treatment eventually experiences the Spee Curve. Since there aren’t many studies examining the relationship between the Curves of Spee and Wilson, their impact on dentoskeletal morphology, and their role in occlusal stability.

The added value of deep brain stimulation (DBS) instead of continued VNS optimization is unknown. In a prospective, non-blinded, randomized patient preference trial of 18 children (aged 8–17 years) who did not respond to VNS after at least 1 year, add-on DBS resulted in greater seizure reduction compared with an additional year of VNS optimization (51.9% vs. 12.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Add-on DBS also resulted in less bothersome seizures (<i>p</i> = 0.03), but no change in quality of life. DBS may be considered earlier for childhood epilepsy after non-response to VNS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to explore manipulation of the Myc protein interactome, members of an oncogene group, in enhancing the intrinsic growth of injured peripheral adult postmitotic neurons and the nerves they supply. New approaches to enhance adult neuron growth properties are a key strategy in improving nerve regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression and impact of Myc interactome members c-Myc, N-Myc, Mad1, and Max were evaluated within naive and “preconditioned” adult sensory neurons and Schwann cells (SCs), using siRNA and transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 or luciferase reporter in vitro. Morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological indices of nerve regeneration were analyzed in vivo.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>c-Myc, N-Myc, Max, and Mad were expressed in adult sensory neurons and in partnering SCs. In vitro knockdown (KD) of either Mad1 or Max, competitive inhibitors of Myc, unleashed heightened neurite outgrowth in both naive uninjured or preconditioned adult neurons. In contrast, KD or inhibition of both isoforms of Myc was required to suppress growth. In SCs, Mad1 KD not only enhanced migratory behavior but also conditioned increased outgrowth in separately cultured adult sensory neurons. In vivo, local Mad1 KD improved electrophysiological, behavioral, and structural indices of nerve regeneration out to 60 days of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Members of the Myc interactome, specifically Mad1, are novel targets for improving nerve regeneration. Unleashing of Myc growth signaling through Mad1 KD enhances the regrowth of both peripheral neurons and SCs to facilitate better regrowth of nerves. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:216–230</p>

<p>We studied 135 MOGAD patients, 135 AQP4+NMOSD, 175 RRMS, and 144 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, MOGAD showed lower GM volumes in the temporal lobes, deep GM, insula, and cingulate cortex (75.79 cm<sup>3</sup>); AQP4+NMOSD in the occipital cortex (32.83 cm<sup>3</sup>); and RRMS diffusely in the GM (260.61 cm<sup>3</sup>). MOGAD showed more pronounced temporal cortex atrophy than RRMS (6.71 cm<sup>3</sup>), whereas AQP4+NMOSD displayed greater occipital cortex atrophy than RRMS (19.82 cm<sup>3</sup>). RRMS demonstrated more pronounced deep GM atrophy in comparison with MOGAD (27.90 cm<sup>3</sup>) and AQP4+NMOSD (47.04 cm<sup>3</sup>). In MOGAD, higher periventricular and cortical/juxtacortical lesions were linked to reduced temporal cortex, deep GM, and insula volumes. In RRMS, the diffuse GM atrophy was associated with lesions in all locations. AQP4+NMOSD showed no lesion/GM volume correlation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>GM atrophy is more widespread in RRMS compared with the other two conditions. MOGAD primarily affects the temporal cortex, whereas AQP4+NMOSD mainly involves the occipital cortex. In MOGAD and RRMS, lesion-related tract degeneration is associated with atrophy, but this link is absent in AQP4+NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:276–288</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on brain structure remain uncertain. Given evidence that a single significant brain injury event increases the risk of dementia, brain-age estimation could provide a novel and efficient indexing of the long-term consequences of TBI. Brain-age procedures use predictive modeling to calculate brain-age scores for an individual using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) is associated with a higher predicted age difference (PAD), but the progression of PAD over time remains unclear. We sought to examine whether PAD increases as a function of time since injury (TSI) and if injury severity and sex interacted to influence this progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Through the ENIGMA Adult Moderate and Severe (AMS)-TBI working group, we examine the largest TBI sample to date (n = 343), along with controls, for a total sample size of n = 540, to replicate and extend prior findings in the study of TBI brain age. Cross-sectional T1w-MRI data were aggregated across 7 cohorts, and brain age was established using a similar brain age algorithm to prior work in TBI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Findings show that PAD widens with longer TSI, and there was evidence for differences between sexes in PAD, with men showing more advanced brain age. We did not find strong evidence supporting a link between PAD and cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides evidence that changes in brain structure after cmsTBI are dynamic, with an initial period of change, followed by relative stability in brain morphometry, eventually leading to further changes in the decades after a single cmsTBI. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:365–377</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For stroke patients with unknown time of onset, mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can guide thrombolytic intervention. However, access to MRI for hyperacute stroke is limited. Here, we sought to evaluate whether a portable, low-field (LF)-MRI scanner can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch in acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke underwent LF-MRI acquisition on a 0.064-T scanner within 24 h of last known well. Qualitative and quantitative metrics were evaluated. Two trained assessors determined the visibility of stroke lesions on LF-FLAIR. An image coregistration pipeline was developed, and the LF-FLAIR signal intensity ratio (SIR) was derived.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 71 patients aged 71 ± 14 years and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 6 (interquartile range 3–14). The interobserver agreement for identifying visible FLAIR hyperintensities was high (<i>κ</i> = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70–0.99). Visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch had a 60% sensitivity and 82% specificity for stroke patients &lt;4.5 h, with a negative predictive value of 93%. LF-FLAIR SIR had a mean value of 1.18 ± 0.18 &lt;4.5 h, 1.24 ± 0.39 4.5–6 h, and 1.40 ± 0.23 &gt;6 h of stroke onset. The optimal cut-point for LF-FLAIR SIR was 1.15, with 85% sensitivity and 70% specificity. A cut-point of 6.6 h was established for a FLAIR SIR &lt;1.15, with an 89% sensitivity and 62% specificity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A 0.064-T portable LF-MRI can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Future research is needed to prospectively validate thresholds and evaluate a role of LF-MRI in guiding thrombolysis among stroke patients with uncertain time of onset.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to delineate 21-year sex-specific trends in recurrence and postrecurrence mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Between 2000 and 2020, first-ever ischemic stroke (IS) patients, ascertained from the population-based BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) project in South Texas, were followed for recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality until December 31, 2020. Multivariable regression models with an interaction between calendar year and sex were used to estimate sex-specific trends and sex differences in recurrence and postrecurrence mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 6,057 IS patients (median age = 69 years, 49.8% women), 654 (10.8%) had a recurrence and 399 (47.7%) had postrecurrence mortality during 5 years of follow-up. In 2000, women had 2.5% higher albeit non-statistically significant 5-year risk of recurrence than men in absolute scale. With the trend declining in women by 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = −10.8 to −4.5%) and in men by 3.6% (95% CI = −6.5% to −0.7%), the risk at the end of the study period was 1.5% (95% CI = −0.3% to 3.6%) lower among women than men. For postrecurrence mortality, the risk was 10.2% lower among women in 2000, but the sex difference was 3.3% by the end of the period, which was due to a larger overall increase in the risk among women than men over the entire time period.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The declines in recurrent stroke suggest successful secondary stroke prevention, especially in women. However, the continued high postrecurrence mortality among both sexes at the end of study period emphasizes the need for ongoing interventions to improve prognosis in those who have had recurrent cerebrovascular events.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26957?af=R">Dietary Caffeine and Brain Dopaminergic Function in Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of dietary caffeine intake on striatal dopamine function and clinical symptoms in Parkinson disease in a cross-sectional and longitudinal setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred sixty-three early Parkinson disease patients and 40 healthy controls were investigated with [<sup>123</sup>I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography, and striatal dopamine transporter binding was evaluated in association with the level of daily coffee consumption and clinical measures. After a median interval of 6.1 years, 44 patients with various caffeine consumption levels underwent clinical and imaging reexamination including blood caffeine metabolite profiling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Unmedicated early Parkinson disease patients with high coffee consumption had 8.3 to 15.4% lower dopamine transporter binding in all studied striatal regions than low consumers, after accounting for age, sex, and motor symptom severity. Higher caffeine consumption was further associated with a progressive decline in striatal binding over time. No significant effects of caffeine on motor function were observed. Blood analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between caffeine metabolites after recent caffeine intake and dopamine transporter binding in the ipsilateral putamen.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Chronic caffeine intake prompts compensatory and cumulative dopamine transporter downregulation, consistent with caffeine's reported risk reduction in Parkinson disease. However, this decline does not manifest in symptom changes. Transiently increased dopamine transporter binding after recent caffeine intake has implications for dopaminergic imaging guidelines.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Due to increased gene dose for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), elderly adults with Down syndrome (DS) are at a markedly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), known as DS-AD. How the increased APP gene dose acts and which APP products are responsible for DS-AD is not well understood, thus limiting strategies to target pathogenesis. As one approach to address this question, we used a novel class of γ-secretase modulators that promote γ-site cleavages by the γ-secretase complex, resulting in lower levels of the Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ts65Dn mice, which serve as a model of DS, were treated via oral gavage with 10 mg/kg/weekday of BPN15606 (a potent and novel pyridazine-containing γ-secretase modulators). Treatment started at 3 months-of-age and lasted for 4 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Demonstrating successful target engagement, treatment with BPN15606 significantly decreased levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cortex and hippocampus; it had no effect on full-length APP or its C-terminal fragments in either 2 N or Ts65Dn mice. Importantly, the levels of total amyloid-β were not impacted, pointing to BPN15606-mediated enhancement of processivity of γ-secretase. Additionally, BPN15606 rescued hyperactivation of Rab5, a protein responsible for regulating endosome function, and normalized neurotrophin signaling deficits. BPN15606 treatment also normalized the levels of synaptic proteins and tau phosphorylation, while reducing astrocytosis and microgliosis, and countering cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings point to the involvement of increased levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 in contributing to several molecular and cognitive traits associated with DS-AD. They speak to increased dosage of the <i>APP</i> gene acting through heightened levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 as supporting pathogenesis. These findings further the interest in the potential use of γ-secretase modulators for treating and possibly preventing AD in individuals with DS. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:390–404</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a complex pathobiology, with genetic and environmental factors being crucial players. Understanding the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in disease activity is crucial for tailored treatment. We explored the impact of DNA methylation, a key mechanism in the genetics-environment interplay, on disease activity in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Peripheral immune methylome profiling using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips was conducted on 249 untreated relapsing–remitting MS patients, sampled at the start of disease-modifying treatment (DMT). A differential methylation analysis compared patients with evidence of disease activity (EDA) to those with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) over 2 years from DMT start. Utilizing causal inference testing (CIT) and Mendelian randomization (MR), we sought to elucidate the relationships between DNA methylation, gene expression, genetic variation, and disease activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between EDA and NEDA. Examining the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 923 variants were found to account for the observed differences in the 4 DMRs. Importantly, 3 out of the 923 SNPs, affecting DNA methylation in a DMR linked to the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) gene, were associated with disease activity risk in an independent cohort of 1,408 MS patients. CIT and MR demonstrated that DNA methylation in AMH acts as a mediator for the genetic risk of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study uncovered a novel molecular pathway implicating the interaction between DNA methylation and genetic variation in the risk of disease activity in MS, emphasizing the role of sex hormones, particularly the AMH, in MS pathobiology. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:289–301</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity are considered closely related motor signs in Parkinson disease (PD), but recent neurophysiological findings suggest distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to examine and compare longitudinal changes in bradykinesia and rigidity in PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical progression of appendicular and axial bradykinesia and rigidity was assessed up to 15 years after STN-DBS in the best treatment conditions (ON medication and ON stimulation). The severity of bradykinesia and rigidity was examined using ad hoc composite scores from specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III). Short- and long-term predictors of bradykinesia and rigidity were analyzed through linear regression analysis, considering various preoperative demographic and clinical data, including disease duration and severity, phenotype, motor and cognitive scores (eg, frontal score), and medication.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 301 patients were examined before and 1 year after surgery. Among them, 101 and 56 individuals were also evaluated at 10-year and 15-year follow-ups, respectively. Bradykinesia significantly worsened after surgery, especially in appendicular segments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, rigidity showed sustained benefit, with unchanged clinical scores compared to preoperative assessment (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Preoperative motor disability (eg, composite scores from the UPDRS-III) predicted short- and long-term outcomes for both bradykinesia and rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Executive dysfunction was specifically linked to bradykinesia but not to rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity show long-term divergent progression in PD following STN-DBS and are associated with independent clinical factors, supporting the hypothesis of partially distinct pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:234–246</p>
