                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2019.00024">LSO:Ce Inorganic Scintillators Are Biocompatible With Neuronal and Circuit Function</a></h4>

Optogenetics is widely used in neuroscience to control neural circuits. However, non-invasive methods for light delivery in brain are needed to avoid physical damage caused by current methods. One potential strategy could employ x-ray activation of radioluminescent particles (RPLs), enabling localized light generation within the brain. RPLs composed of inorganic scintillators can emit light at various wavelengths depending upon composition. Cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO:Ce), an inorganic scintillator that emits blue light in response to x-ray or UV stimulation, could potentially be used to control neural circuits through activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. Whether inorganic scintillators themselves negatively impact neuronal processes and synaptic function is unknown, and was investigated here using cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. As proof of principle, we applied UV stimulation to 4 Âµm LSO:Ce particles during whole-cell recording of CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from mice that expressed ChR2 in glutamatergic neurons. We observed an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), indicating activation of ChR2 and excitation of neurons. Importantly, LSO:Ce particles did not affect survival of primary mouse cortical neurons, even after 24 hours of exposure. In extracellular dendritic field potential recordings, no change in the strength of basal glutamatergic transmission was observed during exposure to LSO:Ce microparticles. However, the amplitude of the fiber volley was slightly reduced with high stimulation. Additionally, there was a slight decrease in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells, with no change in current amplitudes. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents were unchanged. Finally, long term potentiation, a synaptic modification believed to underlie learning and memory and a robust measure of synaptic integrity, was successfully induced, although the magnitude was slightly reduced. Together, these results show LSO:Ce particles are biocompatible even though there are modest effects on baseline synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity. Importantly, we show that light emitted from LSO:Ce particles is able to activate ChR2 and modify synaptic function. Therefore, LSO:Ce inorganic scintillators are potentially viable for use as a new light delivery system for optogenetics.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00049">Peripheral Amyloid Precursor Protein Derivative Expression in Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, ADHD, and epilepsy. While our understanding of FXS pathophysiology has improved, a lack of validated blood-based biomarkers of disease continues to impede bench-to-bedside efforts. To meet this demand, there is a growing effort to discover a reliable biomarker to inform treatment discovery and evaluate treatment target engagement. Such a marker, amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), has shown potential dysregulation in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and may therefore be associated with FXS pathophysiology. While APP is best understood in the context of Alzheimer disease, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the molecule and its derivatives play a broader role in regulating neuronal hyperexcitability, a well-characterized phenotype in FXS.  To explore the viability of APP as a peripheral biological marker in FXS, we conducted a comprehensive ELISA-based evaluation of plasma APP-related species involving 27 persons with FXS (mean age: 22.0Â±11.5) and 25 age- and sex-matched persons with neurotypical development (mean age: 21.1Â±10.7). Peripheral levels of both AÎ²(1-40) and AÎ²(1-42) were increased, while sAPPÎ± was significantly decreased in persons with FXS as compared to control participants. These results suggest that dysregulated APP processing, with potential preferential Î²-secretase processing, may be a readily accessible marker of FXS pathophysiology.

Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes (IFNÎ³-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of IFNÎ³-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that IFNÎ³-DC-Exos may be a potential therapeutic for migraine.

The central nervous system and the immune system are both intricate and highly organized systems that regulate the entire body, with both sharing certain common features in developmental mechanisms and operational modes. It is known that innate immunity-related molecules, such as cytokines, toll-like receptors, the complement family, and acquired immunity-related molecules, such as the major histocompatibility complex and antibody receptors, are also expressed in the brain and play important roles in brain development. Moreover, although the brain has previously been regarded as an immune-privileged site, it is known to contain lymphatic vessels. Not only microglia but also lymphocytes regulate cognition and play a vital role in the formation of neuronal circuits. This review provides an overview of the function of immune cells and immune molecules in the central nervous system, with particular emphasis on their effect on neural developmental processes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00914">Laminin and Environmental Cues Act in the Inhibition of the Neuronal Differentiation of Enteric Glia in vitro</a></h4>

The enteric glia, a neural crest-derived cell type that composes the Enteric Nervous System, is involved in controlling gut functions, including motility, gut permeability, and neuronal communication. Moreover this glial cell could to give rise to new neurons. It is believed that enteric neurons are generated up to 21 days postnatally; however, adult gut cells with glial characteristics can give rise to new enteric neurons under certain conditions. The factors that activate this capability of enteric glia to differentiate into neurons remain unknown. Here, we followed the progress of this neuronal differentiation and investigated this ability by challenging enteric glial cells with different culture conditions. 
We found that, in vitro, enteric glial cells from the gut of adult and neonate mice have a high capability to differentiate into neurons, progressing in acquiring neuronal markers and undergoing morphological changes. In a co-culture system with 3T3 fibroblasts, the number of glial cells entering neurogenesis decreased after 7 days. The effect of 3T3-conditioned medium on adult cells was not significant, and fewer enteric glial cells from neonate mice began the neurogenic process in this medium. Laminin, an extracellular matrix protein that is highly expressed by the niche of the enteric ganglia, seemed to have a large role in inhibiting the differentiation of enteric glia, at least in cells from the adult gut. 
Our results suggest that, in an in-vitro approach that provides conditions more similar to those of enteric glial cells in vivo, these cells could, to some extent, retain their morphology and marker expression, with their neurogenic potential inhibited. Importantly, laminin seemed to inhibit differentiation of adult enteric glial cells. It is possible that the neurogenic differentiation of enteric glia is related to severe changes in the microenvironment, leading to disruption of the basement membrane. In summary, our data indicated that the interaction between the enteric glial cells and their microenvironment molecules significantly affects the control of their behavior and functions.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00060">On the Validation of a Multiple-Network Poroelastic Model Using Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Data</a></h4>

The Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory (MPET) is a numerical model to characterise the transport of multiple fluid networks in the brain, which overcomes the problem of conducting separate analyses on individual fluid compartments and losing the interactions between tissue and fluids, in addition to the interaction between the different fluids themselves. In this paper, the blood perfusion results from MPET modelling are partially validated using cerebral blood flow (CBF) data obtained from arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer to measure CBF. Two subjects â one healthy control and one patient with unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis are included in the validation test. The comparison shows several similarities between CBF data from ASL and blood perfusion results from MPET modelling, such as higher blood perfusion in the grey matter than in the white matter, higher perfusion in the periventricular region for both the healthy control and the patient, and asymmetric distribution of blood perfusion for the patient. Although the partial validation is mainly conducted in a qualitative way, it is one important step towards the full validation of the MPET model, which has the potential to be used as a testing bed for hypotheses and new theories in neuroscience research.

Neurodegeneration is the loss of structure and/or function of neurons. Oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the common etiology in most of the neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of berberine in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we hypothesized that berberine could protect C17.2 neural stem cells from 2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative damage then promote neuronal differentiation. AAPH was used to induce oxidative damage. After the damage, berberine protected C17.2 cells were kept cultured for another week in differentiation medium with/without berberine. Changes in cell morphology were detected by microscopy and cell viability was determined by MTT assay.  Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the associated pathways. Berberine was able to protect C17.2 neural stem cells from the oxidative damage. It lowered the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in C17.2 cells via Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 1/2 (NRF1/2) - NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO-1) - Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway. It also down-regulated the apoptotic factors- Caspase 3 and Bcl2 Associated X (Bax) and upregulated the anti-apoptotic factor- Bcl2 to reduce cell apoptosis. Besides, berberine increased C17.2 cell viability via up-regulating Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (ERK) and phosphor-Extracellular-signal-Related Kinase (pERK) expression. Then, berberine promoted C17.2 cell to differentiate into neurons and the differentiation mechanism involved the activation of WNT/ï¢-catenin pathway as well as the upregulation of expression levels of pro-neural factors Achaete-Scute Complex-Like 1 (ASCL1), Neurogenin 1 (NeuroG1), Neuronal Differentiation 2 (NeuroD2) and Doublecortin (DCX). In conclusion, berberine protected C17.2 neural stem cells from oxidative damage then induced them to differentiate into neurons.

In the present study we assessed efficacy of exosomes harvested from human and mouse stem cell cultures in protection of mouse primary astrocyte and neuronal cell cultures following in vitro ischemia, and against ischemic stroke in vivo. Cell media was collected from primary mouse neural stem cell (NSC) cultures or from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iCM) cultures. Exosomes were extracted and purified by polyethylene glycol complexing and centrifugation, and exosome size and concentration were determined with a NanoSiteTM particle analyzer. Exosomes were applied to primary mouse cortical astrocyte or neuronal cultures prior to, and/or during, combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury. Cell death was assessed via lactate dehydrogenase and propidium iodide staining 24h after injury. Neural stem cell-derived exosomes afforded marked protection to astrocytes following OGD in a dose-dependent manner. A more modest (but significant) level of protection was observed with human iCM-derived exosomes applied to astrocytes, and with NSC-derived exosomes applied to primary neuronal cultures. In subsequent experiments, NSC-derived exosomes were injected intravenously into adult male mice 2h after transient (1h) middle cerebral artery occlusion. Gross motor function was assessed 1d after reperfusion and infarct volume was assessed 4d after reperfusion. Mice treated post-stroke with intravenous NSC-derived exosomes exhibited significantly reduced infarct volumes. Together, these results suggest that exosomes isolated from mouse NSCs provide neuroprotection against experimental stroke possibly via preservation of astrocyte function. Intravenous NSC-derived exosome treatment may therefore provide a novel clinical adjuvant for stroke in the immediate post-injury period.

Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks in the brains of patients with Alzheimerâs disease (AD). However, the constituents of these hallmarks, amyloid beta (AÎ²) 40, AÎ²42, and total Tau (t-Tau), have been detected in the blood of cognitively normal subjects by using an immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay. Whether these levels are age dependent is not known, and their interrelation remains undefined. We determined the levels of these biomarkers in cognitively normal subjects of different age groups. 
A total of 391 cognitively normal subjects aged 23 to 91 were enrolled from hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America. Healthy cognition was evaluated by NIA-AA guidelines to exclude subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and by cognitive assessment using the Mini Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. We examined the effect of age on plasma levels of AÎ²40, AÎ²42, and t-Tau and the relationship between these biomarkers during aging. Additionally, we explored age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. Plasma t-Tau and AÎ²42 levels had modest but significant correlations with chronological age (r = 0.127, p = 0.0120 for t-Tau; r = -0.126, p = 0.0128 for AÎ²42), ranging from ages 23 to 91. Significant positive correlations were detected between AÎ²42 and t-Tau in the groups aged 50 years and older, with Rho values ranging from 0.249 to 0.474. Significant negative correlations were detected between AÎ²40 and t-Tau from age 40 to 91 (r ranged from -0.293 to -0.582) and between AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 in the age groups of 30-39 (r = -0.562, p = 0.0235), 50-59 (r = -0.261, p = 0.0142), 60-69 (r = -0.303, p = 0.0004), and 80-91 (r = 0.459, p = 0.0083). We also provided age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. In this multicenter study, age had weak but significant effects on the levels of AÎ²42 and t-Tau in plasma. However, the age group defined by decade revealed the emergence of a relationship between AÎ²40, AÎ²42, and t-Tau in the 6th and 7th decades. Validation of our findings in a large-scale and longitudinal study is warranted.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44942">Parental vaccination to reduce measles immunity gaps in Italy</a></h4>

High-income countries are experiencing measles reemergence as the result of suboptimal vaccine uptake and marked immunity gaps among adults. In 2017, the Italian Government introduced mandatory vaccination at school entry for ten infectious diseases, including measles. However, sustainable and effective vaccination strategies targeting adults are still lacking. We use a data-driven model of household demography to estimate the potential impact on future measles epidemiology of a novel immunization strategy, to be implemented on top of the 2017 regulation, which consists of offering measles vaccine to the parents of children who get vaccinated. Model simulations suggest that the current vaccination efforts in Italy would not be sufficient to interrupt measles transmission before 2045 because of the frequency of susceptible individuals between 17 and 44 years of age. The integration of the current policy with parental vaccination has the potential to reduce susceptible adults by 17â35%, increasing the chance of measles elimination before 2045 up to 78.9â96.5%.

<p>Early olfactory pathway responses to the presentation of an odor exhibit
remarkably similar characteristics across phyla from insects to mammals, and
frequently involve transitions among quiescence, collective network
oscillations, and asynchronous firing. We investigate whether a robust
bifurcation structure can describe such transitions, and take the locust, which
appears to have one of the simpler early olfactory pathway architectures, as a
representative example. Using an integrate-and-fire (I\&amp;F) model, we reproduce
relevant results of both experimental measurements and detailed models of early
olfaction dynamics and odor discrimination. By further idealizing the I\&amp;F
description and finally reducing it to a firing-rate (FR) model, we find the
bifurcation structure underlying a transition typical of the early odor
response to be a slow passage through a saddle-node-on-an-invariant-circle
(SNIC) bifurcation, which arises due to the interaction among the fast-varying
excitation and fast and slowly-varying inhibition.

<p>Study Objective: Sleep is reflected not only in the electroencephalogram but
also in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. Therefore, we hypothesize that it
is possible to accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and
respiratory signals. Methods: Using a dataset including 8,682 polysomnographs,
we develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory
signals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and
long short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and
breathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest
respiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in
combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the best performance
for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.600 (95% confidence
interval 0.599 -- 0.602); and 0.762 (0.760 -- 0.763) for discriminating awake
vs. rapid eye movement vs. non-rapid eye movement sleep. The performance is
better for young participants and for those with a low apnea-hypopnea index,
while it is robust for commonly used outpatient medications. Conclusions: Our
results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide substantial
information about sleep stages in a large population. It opens new
possibilities in sleep research and applications where electroencephalography
is not readily available or may be infeasible, such as in critically ill
patients.

The underlying pathomechanisms for glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness worldwide, are still not identified. In addition to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and immunological processes seem to play a role. Several pharmacological or molecular/genetic methods are currently investigated as treatment options for this disease. 
Altered autoantibody levels were detected in serum, aqueous humor, and tissue sections of glaucoma patients. To further analyze the role of the immune system, an IOP-independent, experimental autoimmune glaucoma animal (EAG) model was developed. In this model, immunization with ocular antigens leads to antibody depositions, misdirected T-cells, retinal ganglion cell death and degeneration of the optic nerve, similar to glaucomatous degeneration in patients. Moreover, an activation of the complement systems and microglia alterations were identified in the EAG as well as in ocular hypertension models. The inhibition of these factors can alleviate degeneration in glaucoma models with and without high IOP. 
Currently, several neuroprotective approaches are tested in distinct models. It is necessary to have systems that cover underlying pathomechanisms, but also allow for the screening of new drugs. In vitro models are commonly used include single cell lines, mixed-cultures, and even organoids. In ex vivo organ cultures, pathomechanisms as well as therapeutics can be investigated in the whole retina. Furthermore, animal models reveal insights in the in vivo situation. With all these models, several possible new drugs and therapy strategies were tested in the last years. For example, hypothermia treatment, neurotrophic factors or the blockage of excitotoxity. 
However, further studies are required to reveal the pressure independent pathomechanisms behind glaucoma. There is still an open issue whether immune mechanisms directly or indirectly trigger cell death pathways. Hence, it might be an imbalance between protective and destructive immune mechanisms. Moreover, identified therapy options have to be evaluated in more detail, since deeper insights could lead to better treatment options for glaucoma patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49132">Cortical tau deposition follows patterns of entorhinal functional connectivity in aging</a></h4>

Tau pathology first appears in the transentorhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alEC) in the aging brain. The transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to involve amyloid-b (Ab) facilitated tau spread through neural connections. We contrasted functional connectivity (FC) of alEC and posteromedial EC (pmEC), subregions of EC that differ in functional specialization and cortical connectivity, with the hypothesis that alEC-connected cortex would show greater tau deposition than pmEC-connected cortex. We used resting state fMRI to measure FC, and PET to measure tau and AÎ² in cognitively normal older adults. Tau preferentially deposited in alEC-connected cortex compared to pmEC-connected or non-connected cortex, and stronger connectivity was associated with increased tau deposition. FC-tau relationships were present regardless of AÎ², though strengthened with AÎ². These results provide an explanation for the anatomic specificity of neocortical tau deposition in the aging brain and reveal relationships between normal aging and the evolution of AD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46092">Retrograde Ret signaling controls sensory pioneer axon outgrowth</a></h4>

The trafficking mechanisms and transcriptional targets downstream of long-range neurotrophic factor ligand/receptor signaling that promote axon growth are incompletely understood. Zebrafish carrying a null mutation in a neurotrophic factor receptor, Ret, displayed defects in peripheral sensory axon growth cone morphology and dynamics. Ret receptor was highly enriched in sensory pioneer neurons and Ret51 isoform was required for pioneer axon outgrowth. Loss-of-function of a cargo adaptor, Jip3, partially phenocopied Ret axonal defects, led to accumulation of activated Ret in pioneer growth cones, and reduced retrograde Ret51 transport. Jip3 and Ret51 were also retrogradely co-transported, ultimately suggesting Jip3 is a retrograde adapter of active Ret51. Finally, loss of Ret reduced transcription and growth cone localization of Myosin-X, an initiator of filopodial formation. These results show a specific role for Ret51 in pioneer axon growth, and suggest a critical role for long-range retrograde Ret signaling in regulating growth cone dynamics through downstream transcriptional changes.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/754838v1?rss=1">Three-dimensional chromatin interactions remain stable upon CAG/CTG repeat expansion</a></h4>

Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie thirteen neurological disorders, including myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Huntington's disease (HD). Upon expansion, CAG/CTG repeat loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics. This observation raises the hypothesis that repeat expansion provokes changes to higher order chromatin folding and thereby affects both gene expression in cis and the genetic instability of the repeat tract. Here we tested this hypothesis directly by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD patient-derived cells. Surprisingly, chromatin contacts remain unchanged upon repeat expansion at both loci. This was true for loci with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Repeat sizes ranging from 15 to 1,700 displayed strikingly similar chromatin interaction profiles. Our findings argue that extensive changes in heterochromatic properties are not enough to alter chromatin folding at expanded CAG/CTG repeat loci. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded repeat tract did not change three-dimensional chromatin contacts. We conclude that expanded CAG/CTG repeats have little to no effect on chromatin conformation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/753822v1?rss=1">Adjusting ADJUST: Optimizing the ADJUST Algorithm for Pediatric Data Using Geodesic Nets</a></h4>

A major challenge for electroencephalograph (EEG) studies on pediatric populations is that large amounts of data are lost due to artifacts (e.g., movement and blinks). Independent component analysis (ICA) can separate artifactual and neural activity, allowing researchers to remove such artifactual activity and retain a greater percentage of EEG data for analyses. However, manual identification of artifactual components is time consuming and requires subjective judgment. Automated algorithms, like ADJUST and ICLabel, have been validated on adults using the international 10-20 system, but to our knowledge no such algorithms have been optimized for the geodesic sensor net, which is often used with infants and children. Therefore, in an attempt to automate artifact selection for pediatric data collected with geodesic nets, we modified the ADJUST algorithm. Our adjusted-ADJUST algorithm was compared to the original-ADJUST algorithm and ICLabel in adults, children, and infants on three different performance measures: respective classification agreement with expert coders, the number of trials retained following artifact removal, and the reliability of the EEG signal after pre-processing with each algorithm. Overall, the adjusted-ADJUST algorithm performed better than the original-ADJUST algorithm and no ICA correction with adult and pediatric data. Moreover, it performed better than ICLabel for pediatric data. These results indicate that optimizing existing algorithms for data collected with a geodesic net improves artifact classification and retains more trials, potentially facilitating EEG studies with pediatric populations.

Neurons can increase in size dramatically during growth. In many species neurons must preserve their intrinsic dynamics and physiological function across several length scales. For example, neurons in crustacean central pattern generators generate similar activity patterns despite multiple-fold increases in their size and changes in morphology. This scale invariance hints at regulation mechanisms that compensate for size changes by somehow altering membrane currents. Using conductance-based neuron models, we asked whether simple activity-dependent feedback can maintain intrinsic voltage dynamics in a neuron as its size is varied. Despite relying only on a single sensor that measures time-averaged intracellular calcium as a proxy for activity, we found that this regulation mechanism could regulate conductance densities of ion channels, and was robust to changes in the size of the neuron. By mapping changes in cell size onto perturbations in the space of conductance densities of all channels, we show how robustness to size change coexists with sensitivity to perturbations that alter the ratios of maximum conductances of different ion channel types. Our findings suggest that biological regulation that is optimized for coping with expected perturbations such as size changes will be vulnerable to other kinds of perturbations such as channel deletions.

Sensory stimuli are perceived and processed according to their physicochemical and affective signatures. For example, taste perception depends on the chemical identity of a tastant, as well as on its pleasantness or aversiveness. The affective value of a palatable gustatory stimulus changes if it becomes associated with gastric malaise, a phenomenon known as conditioned taste aversion (CTA). CTA depends on activity in the gustatory portion of the insular cortex (GC) and in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). Indeed, inactivation of GC or BLA impairs CTA. Signaling mechanisms typically associated with induction of long term synaptic plasticity are engaged in this form of learning, suggesting that the shift in perception from pleasant to aversive depends on changes in synaptic efficacy. Here we report that CTA modulates synaptic drive onto GC pyramidal neurons, and that long term synaptic depression (LTD) at BLA - GC inputs is sufficient to change the hedonic value of a taste stimulus. Our results demonstrate a direct role for amygdalocortical LTD in taste aversion learning.

Background: Lithium is the first-line mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). In order to interrogate cellular phenotypes related to disease and lithium treatment response, this study used neural precursor cells (NPCs) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from BD patients who are well characterized for clinical lithium response. Methods: BD patients diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria; were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. Clinical lithium response was assessed using the Alda scale and NIMH Retrospective Life chart method. The controls were ethnically matched healthy subjects with no family history of neuropsychiatric illness. NPCs from two BD patients from the same family who clearly differed in their clinical response to lithium were chosen, and compared with healthy population controls. Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and analysis were performed, with and without in vitro lithium (1mM for 7 days). In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell viability and cell proliferation parameters were examined. Experiments were also performed in 25 LCLs from BD patients (16 lithium responders and 9 lithium non-responders), and 12 healthy control LCLs, to evaluate them in a system amenable to clinical translation. Results: RNA-Sequencing and analysis did not reveal differences in NPCs on in vitro lithium treatment. MMP was lower in BD, both in NPCs and LCLs; reversal with in vitro lithium happened only in LCLs and was unrelated to lithium response. Cell proliferation was higher in BD compared to controls, and there was no change on lithium addition. Cell viability assays indicated greater cell death in BD; which could only be rescued in LCLs of clinical lithium responders. The latter finding was associated with enhanced BCL2 and GSK3B expression with in vitro lithium. Discussion: Overall, our study findings indicate that there are cellular phenotypes related to the disease (mitochondrial potential, cell proliferation) in NPCs and LCLs. We also observed clinical lithium response related phenotypes (cell viability, BCL2/ GSK3B expression) in LCLs. The next step would be to evaluate a larger set of PBMCs from clinical lithium response groups of BD to derive cellular phenotypes related to direct clinical application.

Engaging in a demanding activity while holding in mind another task to be performed in the near future requires the maintenance of information about both the currently-active task set and the intended one. However, little is known about how the human brain implements such action plans. While some previous studies have examined the neural representation of current task sets and others have investigated delayed intentions, to date none has examined the representation of current and intended task sets within a single experimental paradigm. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural representation of current and intended task sets, employing sequential classification tasks on human faces. Multivariate decoding analyses showed that current task sets were represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and fusiform gyrus (FG), while intended tasks could be decoded from lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Importantly, a ventromedial region in PFC/OFC contained information about both current and delayed tasks, although cross-classification between the two types of information was not possible. These results help delineate the neural representations of current and intended task sets, and highlight the importance of ventromedial PFC/OFC for maintaining task-relevant information regardless of when it is needed.

The default mode network (DMN) is engaged in a variety of cognitive settings, including social, semantic, temporal, spatial, and self-related tasks. Andrews-Hanna et al. (2010, 2012) proposed that the DMN consists of three distinct functional-anatomical subsystems - a dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) subsystem that supports social processing and introspection about mental states; a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem that contributes to memory retrieval and construction of mental scenes; and a set of midline core hubs that are involved in processing self-referential information. We examined activity in the DMN subsystems during six different tasks: (1) theory of mind and (2) moral dilemmas (for social cognition), (3) autobiographical memory and (4) spatial navigation (for memory-based construction/simulation), (5) self/other adjective judgement (for self-related cognition), and finally, (6) a rest condition compared to a working memory task. At a broad level, we observed similar whole-brain activity maps for the six contrasts, and some response to every contrast in each of the three subsystems. In more detail, both univariate analysis and multivariate activity patterns showed partial functional separation, much of it in close accord with the proposals of separate dMPFC and MTL subsystems, though with less support for common activity across anterior and posterior regions of a midline core. Integrating social, spatial, self-related, and other aspects of a cognitive situation or episode, multiple components of the DMN may work closely together to provide the broad context for current mental activity.

There is a rich behavioral literature on articulatory rehearsal for verbal stimuli, suggesting that rehearsal may facilitate memory, but few studies have examined the benefits for visual stimuli. Neural delay period studies have largely failed to control for the use of maintenance strategies, which make activity patterns during maintenance difficult to interpret. Forty-four participants completed a modified Sternberg Task with either novel scenes (NS) that contained semantic information or phase-scrambled scenes (SS) that lacked it. Participants were instructed to generate a descriptive label and covertly rehearse (CR) or suppress (AS, i.e., repeat "the") during the delay period. Artifact-corrected delay period activity was compared as a function of maintenance strategy (CR vs. AS) and stimulus type (NS vs. SS). Performance on the working memory task for NS revealed that CR neither provided a short- nor long-term behavioral advantage on the delayed recognition task for CR. Interestingly, when task difficulty increased with SS, there was both a significant short-term as well as a long-term advantage. Comparison of sensor-level delay activity during the maintenance phase for NS and SS revealed two distinct patterns of neural activity for NS; there was greater amplitude in the beta range in the right parietal and centromedial regions. For SS, across all sensors during CR, the higher amplitude was observed in the upper alpha and beta ranges. The results suggest that rehearsal increased subsequent memory with SS but not NS. Moreover, neural modulation during the delay period depends on both task difficulty and maintenance strategy.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/753160v1?rss=1">Why is the explicit component of motor adaptation limited in elderly adults?</a></h4>

The cognitive component of motor adaptation declines with aging. Yet, in other motor tasks, older adults appear to rely on cognition to improve their motor performance. It is unknown why older adults are not able to do so in motor adaptation. In order to solve this apparent contradiction, we tested the possibility that older adults require more cognitive resources in unperturbed reaching compared to younger adults, which leaves fewer resources available for the cognitive aspect of motor adaptation. Two cognitive-motor dual-task experiments were designed to test this. The cognitive load of unperturbed reaching was assessed via dual-task costs during the baseline period of visuomotor rotation experiments, which provided us with an estimation of the amount of cognitive resources used during unperturbed reaching. However, since we did not observe a link between dual-task costs and explicit adaptation in both experiments, we failed to confirm this hypothesis. Instead, we observed that explicit adaptation was mainly associated with visuospatial working memory capacity. This suggests that visuospatial working memory of an individual might be linked to the extent of explicit adaptation for young and older adults.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/753095v1?rss=1">Transient astrocytic Gq signaling underlies remote memory enhancement</a></h4>

Astrocytes elicit transient Ca2+ elevations induced by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), yet their role in vivo remains unknown. To address this, transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of the optogenetic Gq-type GPCR, Opto1AR, were established, in which transient Ca2+ elevations similar to those in wild type mice were induced by brief blue light illumination. Activation of cortical astrocytes resulted in an adenosine A1 receptor-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity. Moreover, sensory stimulation with astrocytic activation induced long-term depression of sensory evoked response. At the behavioral level, repeated astrocytic activation in the anterior cortex gradually affected novel open field exploratory behavior, and remote memory was enhanced in a novel object recognition task. These effects were blocked by A1 receptor antagonism. On the other hand, compelling evidence for astrocytic Ca2+-induced diameter changes of arteries was not observed. Together, we demonstrate that GPCR-triggered Ca2+ elevation in cortical astrocytes has causal impacts on neuronal activity and behavior.

Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with proteostasis disturbances and accumulation of fibrillar proteins into insoluble aggregates. Progressive age-related degeneration of dopamine neurons is a primary cause of motor dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease (PD) and substantial evidence supports critical involvement of -synuclein (-syn) in the etiology of PD. -syn is a cytosolic protein present in high concentrations in pre-synaptic neuronal terminals and a primary constituent of intracellular protein aggregates known as Lewy Neurites or Lewy Bodies. Progression of Lewy pathology is a characteristic feature in the PD brains caused by the prion-like self-templating properties of misfolded -syn. Modelling Lewy pathology progression with application of exogenously prepared -syn preformed fibrils, we discovered that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) prevented formation of -syn aggregates in dopamine neurons in culture and in vivo after viral vector expression of GDNF. These effects were abolished by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, the major GDNF signaling pathway. Similar to GDNF, expression of mutated constitutively active RET (RET_MEN2B) was able to protect dopamine neurons. GDNF protection against -syn pathology progression was abolished by Src and attenuated by Akt pathway inhibitors. For the first time, we have shown the neurotrophic factor-mediated protection against the misfolded -syn propagation in dopamine neurons, uncovered underlying receptor and intracellular signaling pathways. These results for the first time demonstrate that activation of GDNF/RET signaling can be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent Lewy pathology spread at early stages of PD.

The (ir)regularity of neural time series patterns as assessed via Multiscale Sample Entropy (MSE; e.g., Costa et al., 2002) has been proposed as a complementary measure to signal variance, but the con- and divergence between these measures often remains unclear in applications. Importantly, the estimation of sample entropy is referenced to the magnitude of fluctuations, leading to a trade-off between variance and entropy that questions unique entropy modulations. This problem deepens in multi-scale implementations that aim to characterize signal irregularity at distinct timescales. Here, the normalization parameter is traditionally estimated in a scale-invariant manner that is dominated by slow fluctuations. These issues question the validity of the assumption that entropy estimated at finer/coarser time scales reflects signal irregularity at those same scales. While accurate scale-wise mapping is critical for valid inference regarding signal entropy, systematic analyses have been largely absent to date. Here, we first simulate the relations between spectral power (i.e., frequency-specific signal variance) and MSE, highlighting a diffuse reflection of rhythms in entropy time scales. Second, we replicate known cross-sectional age differences in EEG data, while highlighting how timescale-specific results depend on the spectral content of the analyzed signal. In particular, we note that the presence of both low- and high-frequency dynamics leads to the reflection of power spectral density slopes in finer time scales. This association co-occurs with previously reported age differences in both measures, suggesting a common, power-based origin. Furthermore, we highlight that age differences in high frequency power can account for observed entropy differences at coarser scales via the traditional normalization procedure. By systematically assessing the impact of spectral signal content and normalization choice, our findings highlight fundamental biases in traditional MSE implementations. We make multiple recommendations for future work to validly interpret estimates of signal irregularity at time scales of interest.

The pontine nuclei play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. However, pontine ensemble dynamics underlying sleep regulation remain poorly understood. By monitoring population activity in multiple pontine and adjacent brainstem areas, here we show slow, state-predictive pontine ensemble dynamics and state-dependent interactions between the pons and the cortex in mice. On a timescale of seconds to minutes, pontine populations exhibit diverse firing across vigilance states, with some of these dynamics being attributed to cell type-specific activity. Pontine population activity can predict pupil dilation and vigilance states: pontine neurons exhibit longer predictable power compared with hippocampal neurons. On a timescale of sub-seconds, pontine waves (P-waves) are observed as synchronous firing of pontine neurons primarily during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but also during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Crucially, P-waves functionally interact with cortical activity in a state-dependent manner: during NREM sleep, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) precede P-waves. On the other hand, P-waves during REM sleep are phase-locked with ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations and are followed by burst firing in a subset of hippocampal neurons. Thus, the directionality of functional interactions between the hippocampus and pons changes depending on sleep states. This state-dependent global coordination between pontine and cortical regions implicates distinct functional roles of sleep.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/752246v1?rss=1">Perceptual learning of lesions in mammograms induced by response feedback during training</a></h4>

Detecting subtle lesions in mammograms indicative of early breast cancer usually requires years of experience. Well-designed training paradigms could be a strong tool for promoting perceptual learning (PL) with rapid and long-lasting improvement in detectability of these subtle mammographic lesions. Given that PL occurs without feedback about the accuracy of subjects' responses, the role of feedback has been completely ignored in clinical applications of PL. However, in this study, we found that the contents of the feedback profoundly and differentially influence the formation and retention of PL to detect calcification and architectural distortion lesions, two types of mammographic lesions that are frequently missed in mammographic screenings. We trained subjects to detect one type of lesion in a mammogram and manipulated the content of the response feedback during training for 3 groups (no feedback, correctness only, and both correctness and location of the lesion). We found that PL occurred for both lesions when both correctness and location feedback were provided. PL also occurred for calcifications but not for distortions when only correctness was provided. No learning occurred without feedback for either lesion. A retest conducted six months later showed that PL was retained only in the group with both correctness and location feedback for both types of lesions. In contrast to the general consensus of basic PL studies, our results demonstrate that the content of the response feedback is a determining factor in forming and retaining PL to detect mammographic lesions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/752089v1?rss=1">Dysfunctional and compensatory brain networks underlying math fluency</a></h4>

Poor math fluency, or timed calculation (TC) performance, is a characteristic of dyscalculia, a common cause of poor educational and occupational outcomes. Here, we examined neural substrates of dysfunctional math fluency and potential compensatory mechanisms. We performed functional MRI scans of participants with divergent performance on an event-related TC paradigm (poor TC, &lt;0.5 accuracy, n=34; vs. controls, accuracy&gt;0.8, n=34). Individuals with poor TC had decreased intraparietal sulcus (IPS) engagement, and decreased IPS-striatal and IPS-prefrontal effective connectivity. We next examined an independent well-performing sample (TC accuracy&gt;0.8, n=100), stratified according to relatively low- versus high-IPS activation during TC. Relatively reduced IPS engagement, or patterns of IPS-related effective connectivity similar to those with poor TC, appeared to be compensated for by increased engagement of effective connectivity involving fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and striatum. Neural connectivity involving high-level visual processing in fusiform gyrus and related ventral cortical networks may be relevant in compensatory function ameliorating aspects of dyscalculia and mathematical difficulty.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/751891v1?rss=1">The process of Lewy body formation, rather than simply alpha-synuclein fibrillization, is the major driver of neurodegeneration in synucleinopathies</a></h4>

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (-syn) into intraneuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies (LB). Although it is widely believed that -syn plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD and synucleinopathies, the processes that govern -syn fibrillization and LB formation in the brain remain poorly understood. In this work, we sought to reverse engineer LBs and dissect the spatiotemporal events involved in their biogenesis at the genetic, molecular, biochemical, structural, and cellular levels. Toward this goal, we took advantage of a seeding-based model of -syn fibril formation in primary neurons and further developed this model to generate the first neuronal model that reproduces the key events leading to LB formation; including seeding, fibrillization, and the formation of LB-like inclusions that recapitulate many of the biochemical, structural, and organizational features of LBs found in post-mortem human PD brain tissues. Next, we applied an integrative approach combining confocal and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging methods with biochemical profiling of -syn species and temporal proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to dissect the molecular events associated with LB formation and maturation and to elucidate their contributions to neuronal dysfunctions and neurodegeneration in PD and synucleinopathies. The results from these studies demonstrate that LB formation involves a complex interplay between -syn fibrillization, post-translational modifications, and interactions between -syn aggregates and membranous organelles, including mitochondria and the autophagosome and endolysosome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the process of LB formation and maturation, rather than simply fibril formation, is the major driver of neurodegeneration through disruption of cellular functions and inducing mitochondria damage and deficits, as well as synaptic dysfunctions. Having a neuronal model that allows for unlinking of the key processes involved in LB formation is crucial for elucidating the molecular and cellular determinants of each process and their contributions to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in PD and synucleinopathies. Such a model is essential to efforts to identify and investigate the mode of action and toxicity of drug candidates targeting -syn aggregation and LB formation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/751628v1?rss=1">Age-related differences in white matter: Comparing fixel based and tensor based analyses</a></h4>

Older adults tend to perform worse on cognitive, behavioral, motor, and sensory tasks compared to younger adults, and differences in white matter that may be associated with this phenomenon are being actively investigated. Most prior studies of white matter differences between older and younger adults have analyzed diffusion weighted images using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis. But DTI results can be affected by many different factors (e.g., fiber density, fiber cross-section, crossing fibers) that are difficult to distinguish, making the interpretation of these results challenging. Recently, new fixel-based analysis (FBA) techniques have been developed that address some of these concerns, but these techniques have not yet been applied in the domain of aging. In this study, we used both DTI and FBA to analyze differences in white matter in a large sample of older and younger healthy adults. Both analysis methods identified age differences in forceps minor, fornix, bilateral internal capsule, and bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, but the FBA results provided novel insights into the underlying structural differences. Furthermore, DTI analysis identified differences in superior longitudinal fasciculus that are not reflected in fiber density or cross-section and may instead be due to differences in crossing fiber geometry. Finally, the FBA results identified clearer differences in limbic white matter than did the DTI analysis. It also provided stronger evidence of an anterior-posterior asymmetry and segment-specific variations in white matter differences between older and younger adults. These results demonstrate the power of fixel-based analysis and provide novel insights into some of the major white matter differences associated with healthy aging.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/750992v1?rss=1">A supragranular nexus for the effects of neocortical beta events on human tactile perception</a></h4>

Transient neocortical events with high spectral power in the 15-29Hz beta band are among the most reliable predictors of sensory perception: High prestimulus beta event rates in primary somatosensory lead to sensory suppression, most effective at 100-300ms prestimulus latency. However, the synaptic and neuronal mechanisms inducing beta's perceptual effects have not been completely localized. We combined human MEG with neural modeling designed to account for these macroscale signals to interpret the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie the influence of beta on tactile detection. Extending prior studies, we modeled the hypothesis that higher-order thalamic bursts, sufficient for beta event generation in cortex, recruit supragranular GABAB inhibition acting on a 300ms time scale to suppress sensory information. Consistency between model and MEG data supported this hypothesis and led to a further prediction, validated in our data, that stimuli are perceived when beta events occur simultaneously with tactile stimulation. The post-event suppressive mechanism explains an array of studies that associate beta with decreased processing, while the during-event mechanism may demand a reinterpretation of the role of beta events in the context of coincident timing.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/750869v1?rss=1">Distinct cellular mediators drive the Janus Faces of Toll-like Receptor 4 regulation of network excitability which impacts working memory performance after brain Injury</a></h4>

The mechanisms by which the neurophysiological and inflammatory responses to brain injury contribute to memory impairments are not fully understood. Recently, we reported that the innate immune receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) enhances AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents and excitability in the dentate gyrus after fluid percussion brain injury (FPI) while limiting excitability in controls. Here we examine the cellular mediators underlying TLR4 regulation of dentate excitability and its impact on memory performance. In ex vivo slices, astrocytic and microglial metabolic inhibitors selectively abolished TLR4 antagonist modulation of excitability in controls, without impacting FPI rats, demonstrating that glial signaling contributes to TLR4 regulation of excitability in controls. In glia-depleted neuronal cultures from naive mice, TLR4 ligands bidirectionally modulated AMPAR charge transfer demonstrating the ability of neuronal TLR4 to regulate excitability, as observed after brain injury. In vivo TLR4 antagonism reduced early post-injury increases in mediators of MyD88-dependent and independent TLR4 signaling without altering expression in controls. Blocking TNF, a downstream effector of TLR4, mimicked effects of TLR4 antagonist and occluded TLR4 agonist modulation of excitability in slices from both control and FPI rats. Functionally, transiently blocking TLR4 in vivo improved impairments in working memory observed one week and one month after FPI, while the same treatment impaired memory function in uninjured controls. Together these data identify that distinct cellular signaling mechanisms converge on TNF to mediate TLR4 modulation of network excitability in the uninjured and injured brain and demonstrate a role for TLR4 in regulation of working memory function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/750844v1?rss=1">Visual acuity performance level is independent of locomotion</a></h4>

Locomotion has a global impact on circuit function throughout the cortex, including regulation of spatiotemporal dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1). The mechanisms driving state-changes in V1 result in a 2-3 fold gain of responsiveness to visual stimuli. To determine whether locomotion-mediated increases in response gain improve the perception of spatial acuity we developed a head-fixed task in which mice were free to run or sit still during acuity testing. Spatial acuity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 cycles/deg, was assessed before and after 3-4 weeks of reward-based training in adult mice. Training on vertical orientations once a day improved the average performance across mice by 22.5 +/- 0.05%. Improvement transferred to non-trained orientations presented at 45 deg, indicating that the improvement in acuity generalized. Furthermore we designed a second closed-loop task in which acuity threshold could be directly assessed in a single session. Using this design, we established that acuity threshold matched the upper limit of the trained spatial frequency; in two mice spatial acuity threshold reached as high as 1.5 cycles/deg. During the 3-4 weeks of training we collected a sufficient number of stimulus trials in which mice performed above chance but below 100% accuracy. Using this subset of stimulus trials, we found that perceptual acuity was not enhanced on trials in which mice were running compared to trials in which mice were still. Our results demonstrate that perception of spatial acuity is not improved by locomotion.

<p>Publication date: October 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58</p><p>Author(s): Tatyana O Sharpee</p><div><p>This review connects several lines of research to argue that hyperbolic geometry should be broadly applicable to neural circuits as well as other biological circuits. The reason for this is that networks that conform to hyperbolic geometry are maximally responsive to external and internal perturbations. These networks also allow for efficient communication under conditions where nodes are added or removed. We will argue that one of the signatures of hyperbolic geometry is the celebrated Zipfâs law (also sometimes known as the Pareto distribution) that states that the probability to observe a given pattern is inversely related to its rank. Zipfâs law is observed in a variety of biological systems â from protein sequences, neural networks to economics. These observations provide further evidence for the ubiquity of networks with an underlying hyperbolic metric structure. Recent studies in neuroscience specifically point to the relevance of a three-dimensional hyperbolic space for neural signaling. The three-dimensional hyperbolic space may confer additional robustness compared to other dimensions. We illustrate how the use of hyperbolic coordinates revealed a novel topographic organization within the olfactory system. The use of such coordinates may facilitate representation of relevant signals elsewhere in the brain.</p></div>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To longitudinally evaluate the role of depression in the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we included PD patients without ICDs at baseline according to the Questionnaire for ImpulsiveâCompulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP). Patients were prospectively evaluated first quarterly and then biannually. Development of an ICD was defined as an increase in QUIP scores during followâup. Using survival proportional hazard models, we studied the effect of baseline depression on ICD risk. We also evaluated this effect controlling for dopamine agonist use as a timeâdependent variable and for other potential confounders.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 354 patients, 68 were depressed at baseline. The median followâup was 4.08âyears. Depression at baseline was associated with higher ICD risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32â2.9, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001). This risk remained significant after controlling for dopamine agonist use (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.33â2.9, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001), which was also independently linked to ICD development (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.3â2.7, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001). Therefore, depressed patients faced an even higher ICD risk when receiving dopamine agonists. Controlling for multiple potential confounders did not alter these results.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Depression predisposes to the development of ICDs in PD. This risk is magnified by dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists should thus be used cautiously in depressed PD patients. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>by Hilje M. Doekes, Rob J. de Boer, Rutger Hermsen</p>

The production of anticompetitor toxins is widespread among bacteria. Because production of such toxins is costly, it is typically regulated. In particular, many toxins are produced only when the local cell density is high. It is unclear which selection pressures shaped the evolution of density-dependent regulation of toxin production. Here, we study the evolution of toxin production, resistance and the response to a cell-density cue in a model of an evolving bacterial population with spatial structure. We present results for two growth regimes: (i) an undisturbed, fixed habitat in which only small fluctuations of cell density occur, and (ii) a serial-transfer regime with large fluctuations in cell density. We find that density-dependent toxin production can evolve under both regimes. However, the selection pressures driving the evolution of regulation differ. In the fixed habitat, regulation evolves because it allows cells to produce toxin only when opportunities for reproduction are highly limited (because of a high local cell density), and the effective fitness costs of toxin production are hence low. Under serial transfers, regulation evolves because it allows cells to switch from a fast-growing non-toxic phenotype when colonising a new habitat, to a slower-growing competitive toxic phenotype when the cell density increases. Colonies of such regulating cells rapidly expand into unoccupied space because their edges consist of fast-growing, non-toxin-producing cells, but are also combative because cells at the interfaces with competing colonies do produce toxin. Because under the two growth regimes different types of regulation evolve, our results underscore the importance of growth conditions in the evolution of social behaviour in bacteria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bdSt5cEKecc" width="1" />

The confluence of deep sequencing and powerful machine learning is providing an unprecedented peek at the darkest of the dark genomic matter, the non-coding genomic regions lacking any functional annotation. While deep sequencing uncovers rare tumor variants, the heterogeneity of the disease confounds the best of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here we set out to answer if the dark-matter of the genome encompass signals that can distinguish the fine subtypes of disease that are otherwise gnomically indistinguishable. We introduce a novel stochastic regularization, <i>ReVeaL</i>, that empowers ML to discriminate subtle cancer subtypes even from the same âcell of originâ. Analogous to <i>heritability</i>, implicitly defined on whole genome, we use <i>predictability (F</i><sub>1</sub> <i>score)</i> definable on portions of the genome. In an effort to distinguish cancer subtypes using dark-matter DNA, we applied <i>ReVeaL</i> to a new WGS dataset from 727 patient samples with seven forms of hematological cancers and assessed the predictivity over several genomic regions including genic, non-dark, non-coding, non-genic, and dark. ReVeaL enabled improved discrimination of cancer subtypes for all segments of the genome. The non-genic, non-coding and dark-matter had the highest F<sub>1</sub> scores, with dark-matter having the highest level of predictability. Based on ReVeaLâs predictability of different genomic regions, dark-matter contains enough signal to significantly discriminate fine subtypes of disease. Hence, the agglomeration of rare variants, even in the hitherto unannotated and ill-understood regions of the genome, may play a substantial role in the disease etiology and deserve much more attention.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AWa3f49FujM" width="1" />

Thirteen tubulin protofilaments, made of Î±Î²-tubulin heterodimers, interact laterally to produce cytoskeletal microtubules. Microtubules exhibit the striking property of dynamic instability, manifested in their intermittent growth and shrinkage at both ends. This behavior is key to many cellular processes, such as cell division, migration, maintenance of cell shape, etc. Although assembly and disassembly of microtubules is known to be linked to hydrolysis of a guanosine triphosphate molecule in the pocket of Î²-tubulin, detailed mechanistic understanding of corresponding conformational changes is still lacking. Here we take advantage of the recent generation of in-microtubule structures of tubulin to examine the properties of protofilaments, which serve as important microtubule assembly and disassembly intermediates. We find that initially straight tubulin protofilaments, relax to similar non-radially curved and slightly twisted conformations. Our analysis further suggests that guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis primarily affects the flexibility and conformation of the inter-dimer interface, without a strong impact on the shape or flexibility of Î±Î²-heterodimer. Inter-dimer interfaces are significantly more flexible compared to intra-dimer interfaces. We argue that such a difference in flexibility could be key for distinct stability of the plus and minus microtubule ends. The higher flexibility of the inter-dimer interface may have implications for development of pulling force by curving tubulin protofilaments during microtubule disassembly, a process of major importance for chromosome motions in mitosis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KXXAwMSsDkU" width="1" />

<p>by Joel A. Paulson, Marc Martin-Casas, Ali Mesbah</p>

We present a novel surrogate modeling method that can be used to accelerate the solution of uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems arising in nonlinear and non-smooth models of biological systems. In particular, we focus on dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) models that couple intracellular fluxes, found from the solution of a constrained metabolic network model of the cellular metabolism, to the time-varying nature of the extracellular substrate and product concentrations. DFBA models are generally computationally expensive and present unique challenges to UQ, as they entail dynamic simulations with discrete events that correspond to switches in the active set of the solution of the constrained intracellular model. The proposed non-smooth polynomial chaos expansion (nsPCE) method is an extension of traditional PCE that can effectively capture singularities in the DFBA model response due to the occurrence of these discrete events. The key idea in nsPCE is to use a model of the singularity time to partition the parameter space into two elements on which the model response behaves smoothly. Separate PCE models are then fit in both elements using a basis-adaptive sparse regression approach that is known to scale well with respect to the number of uncertain parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nsPCE on a DFBA model of an <i>E. coli</i> monoculture that consists of 1075 reactions and 761 metabolites. We first illustrate how traditional PCE is unable to handle problems of this level of complexity. We demonstrate that over 800-fold savings in computational cost of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian estimation of parameters in the substrate uptake kinetics can be achieved by using the nsPCE surrogates in place of the full DFBA model simulations. We then investigate the scalability of the nsPCE method by utilizing it for global sensitivity analysis and maximum a posteriori estimation in a synthetic metabolic network problem with a larger number of parameters related to both intracellular and extracellular quantities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WoA4fVMQy_w" width="1" />

<p>by Franca Schmid, Matthew J. P. Barrett, Dominik Obrist, Bruno Weber, Patrick Jenny</p>

Capillaries are the prime location for oxygen and nutrient exchange in all tissues. Despite their fundamental role, our knowledge of perfusion and flow regulation in cortical capillary beds is still limited. Here, we use <i>in vivo</i> measurements and blood flow simulations in anatomically accurate microvascular network to investigate the impact of red blood cells (RBCs) on microvascular flow. Based on these <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> experiments, we show that the impact of RBCs leads to a bias toward equation the values of the outflow velocities at divergent capillary bifurcations, for which we coin the term â<i>well-balanced bifurcations</i>â. Our simulation results further reveal that hematocrit heterogeneity is directly caused by the RBC dynamics, i.e. by their unequal partitioning at bifurcations and their effect on vessel resistance. These results provide the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence of the impact of RBC dynamics on the flow field in the cortical microvasculature. By structural and functional analyses of our blood flow simulations we show that capillary diameter changes locally alter flow and RBC distribution. A dilation of 10% along a vessel length of 100 Î¼m increases the flow on average by 21% in the dilated vessel downstream a <i>well-balanced bifurcation</i>. The number of RBCs rises on average by 27%. Importantly, RBC up-regulation proves to be more effective the more balanced the outflow velocities at the upstream bifurcation are. Taken together, we conclude that diameter changes at capillary level bear potential to locally change the flow field and the RBC distribution. Moreover, our results suggest that the balancing of outflow velocities contributes to the robustness of perfusion. Based on our <i>in silico</i> results, we anticipate that the bi-phasic nature of blood and small-scale regulations are essential for a well-adjusted oxygen and energy substrate supply.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/80S8CKzXATk" width="1" />

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new opportunities to gain a mechanistic understanding of many biological processes. Current approaches for single cell clustering are often sensitive to the input parameters and have difficulty dealing with cell types with different densities. Here, we present Panoramic View (PanoView), an iterative method integrated with a novel density-based clustering, Ordering Local Maximum by Convex hull (OLMC), that uses a heuristic approach to estimate the required parameters based on the input data structures. In each iteration, PanoView will identify the most confident cell clusters and repeat the clustering with the remaining cells in a new PCA space. Without adjusting any parameter in PanoView, we demonstrated that PanoView was able to detect major and rare cell types simultaneously and outperformed other existing methods in both simulated datasets and published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. Finally, we conducted scRNA-Seq analysis of embryonic mouse hypothalamus, and PanoView was able to reveal known cell types and several rare cell subpopulations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OCQ8ywsFoPA" width="1" />

<p>by Ryan S. Phillips, Jonathan E. Rubin</p>

The mechanism(s) of action of most commonly used pharmacological blockers of voltage-gated ion channels are well understood; however, this knowledge is rarely considered when interpreting experimental data. Effects of blockade are often assumed to be equivalent, regardless of the mechanism of the blocker involved. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this assumption may not always be correct. We simulate the blockade of a persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>), proposed to underlie rhythm generation in pre-BÃ¶tzinger complex (pre-BÃ¶tC) respiratory neurons, via two distinct pharmacological mechanisms: (1) pore obstruction mediated by tetrodotoxin and (2) altered inactivation dynamics mediated by riluzole. The reported effects of experimental application of tetrodotoxin and riluzole in respiratory circuits are diverse and seemingly contradictory and have led to considerable debate within the field as to the specific role of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> in respiratory circuits. The results of our simulations match a wide array of experimental data spanning from the level of isolated pre-BÃ¶tC neurons to the level of the intact respiratory network and also generate a series of experimentally testable predictions. Specifically, in this study we: (1) provide a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> block, (2) show that the effects of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations, (3) demonstrate and explain why riluzole application may fail to effectively block <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> in the intact respiratory network, and (4) derive the prediction that effective block of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> by low concentration tetrodotoxin will stop respiratory rhythm generation in the intact respiratory network. These simulations support a critical role for <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and illustrate the importance of considering mechanism when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oyj_NI2Dffk" width="1" />

<p>It is widely believed that the backpropagation algorithm is essential for
learning good feature detectors in early layers of artificial neural networks,
so that these detectors are useful for the task performed by the higher layers
of that neural network. At the same time, the traditional form of
backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an
unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility, and which
is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local
- i.e. should depend only on the activities of the pre and post synaptic
neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the
hidden layer, and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a
completely unsupervised way. These learned lower layer feature detectors can be
used to train higher layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the
performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard
feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm.

One fundamental feature of consciousness is that the contents of consciousness depend on the state of consciousness. Here we propose an answer to why this is so: both the state and the contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops with each other. Functionally this coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and the contents of consciousness. Together the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops form a thalamo-cortical broadcasting system, where the layer 5 pyramidal cells are the central elements. This perspective makes one quite specific prediction: cortical processing that does not include layer 5 pyramidal neurons will be unconscious. More generally, the present perspective suggests that layer 5 pyramidal neurons have a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness.

Neurological disease, including Alzheimerâs disease (AD), Parkinsonâs disease (PD), which were caused by abnormalities in the nervous system, involves the accumulation of false proteins, neurotransmitter abnormalities, neuronal apoptosis, etc. As an alternative supplementary medicine (ASM), acupuncture plays an important role in the treatment of neurological diseases. In this review, we summarized the current evidence for the treatment efficacy of acupuncture in AD and PD from the perspective of clinical trials and animal model. Acupuncture can inhibit the accumulation of toxic proteins in neurological diseases, modulate energy supply based on glucose metabolism, depress neuronal apoptosis, etc., and exert a wide range of neuroprotective effects.

Motor imagery (MI) has been widely used to operate brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for rehabilitation and some life assistive devices. However, the current performance of an MI-based BCI cannot fully meet the needs of its in-field applications. Most of the BCIs utilizing a generalized feature for all participants have been found to greatly hamper the efficacy of the BCI system. Hence, some attempts have made on the exploration of subject-dependent parameters, but it remains challenging to enhance BCI performance as expected. To this end, in this study, we used the independent component analysis (ICA), which has been proved capable of isolating the pure motor-related component from non-motor-related brain processes and artifacts and extracting the common motor-related component across motor imagery (MI), motor execution (ME), and motor observation (MO) conditions. Then, a sliding window approach was used to detect significant mu-suppression from the baseline using the EEG alpha power time course and, thus, the success rate of the mu-suppression detection could be assessed on a single-trial basis. By comparing the success rates using different parameters, we further quantified the extent of the improvement in each motor condition to evaluate the effectiveness of both generalized and individualized parameters. The results showed that in ME condition, the success rate under individualized latency and that under generalized latency was 90.0% and 77.75 %, respectively; in MI condition, the success rate was 74.14% for individual latency and 58.47% for generalized latency, and in MO condition, the success rate was 67.89% and 61.26% for individual and generalized latency, respectively. As can be seen, the success rate in each motor condition was significantly improved by utilizing an individualized latency compared to that using the generalized latency. Moreover, the comparison of the individualized window latencies for the mu-suppression detection across different runs of the same participant as well as across different participants showed that the window latency was significantly more consistent in the intra-subject than in the inter-subject settings. As a result, we proposed that individualizing the latency for detecting the mu-suppression feature for each participant might be a promising attempt to improve the MI-based BCI performance.

Sensory feedback, which can be presented in different modalities - single and combined, aids task performance in human-robot interaction (HRI). However, combining feedback modalities does not always lead to optimal performance. Indeed, it is not known how feedback modalities affect operator performance under stress. Furthermore, there is limited information on how feedback affects neural processes differently for males and females and under stress. This is a critical gap in the literature, particularly in the domain of surgical robotics, where surgeons are under challenging socio-technical environments that burden them physiologically. In the present study, we posited operator performance as the summation of task performance and neurophysiological cost of maintaining that performance. In a within-subject design, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess cerebral activations of 12 participants who underwent a 3D manipulation task within a virtual environment with concurrent feedback (visual and visual + haptic) in the presence and absence of a cognitive stressor. Cognitive stress was induced with the serial-7 subtraction test. We found that while task performance was higher with visual than visual + haptic feedback, it degraded under stress. The two feedback modalities were found to be associated with varying neural activities and neural efficiencies, and these were stress- and gender-dependent. Our findings engender further investigation into effectiveness of feedback modalities on males and females under stressful conditions in HRI.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00398">Reversal of Cognitive Impairment in gp120 Transgenic Mice by the Removal of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor</a></h4>

Activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), by the proneurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), triggers loss of synapses and promotes neuronal death.  These pathological features are also caused by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) envelope protein gp120, which increases the levels of proBDNF.  To establish whether p75NTR plays a role in gp120-mediated neurite pruning, we exposed primary cultures of cortical neurons from p75NTR-/- mice to gp120.  We found that the lack of p75NTR expression significantly reduced gp120-mediated neuronal cell death. To determine whether knocking down p75NTR is neuroprotective in vivo, we intercrossed gp120 transgenic (tg) mice with p75NTR heterozygous mice to obtain gp120tg mice lacking one or two p75NTR alleles.  The removal of p75NTR alleles inhibited gp120-mediated decrease of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, as measured by the levels of PSD95 and subunits of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor in synaptosomes. Moreover, the deletion of only one copy of the p75NTR gene was sufficient to restore the cognitive impairment observed in gp120tg mice.  Our data suggest that activation of p75NTR is one of the mechanisms crucial for the neurotoxic effect of gp120. These data indicate that p75NTR antagonists could provide an adjunct therapy against synaptic simplification caused by HIV.

The brain is the most functionally organized structure of all organs. It manages behavior, perception and higher cognitive functions. The WWOX gene is non classical tumor suppressor gene, which has been shown to have an impact on proliferation, apoptosis and migration processes. Moreover, genetic aberrations in WWOX induce severe neuropathological phenotypes in humans and rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate in detail the impact of WWOX on human neural stem cell maintenance and how depletion of WWOX disturbs signaling pathways playing a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and CNS organogenesis. Human neural stem cells with a silenced WWOX gene exhibited lowered mitochondrial redox potential, enhanced adhesion to fibronectin and extracellular matrix protein mixture, downregulation of MMP2/9 expression and impaired 3D growth. Global transcriptome analysis using CAGE found that WWOX downregulation significantly changes the expression of multiple genes engaged in cytoskeleton organization, adhesion, cell signaling and chromatin remodeling. The massive changes in gene expression caused by WWOX silencing may strongly affect the differentiation and migration of neurons in organogenesis, brain injury, cancerogenesis or neurodifferentiation. WWOX gene appears to be an important regulator of neural tissue architecture and function.

Acupuncture therapy (AT) is a nonpharmacological method of treatment that has been applied to various neurological diseases. However, studies on its longitudinal effect on the neural mechanisms of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for treatment purposes are still lacking in the literature. In this clinical study, we assess the longitudinal effects of ATs on MCI patients using two methods: i) Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA-K, Korean version), and ii) the hemodynamic response (HR) analyses using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS signals of a working memory (WM) task were acquired from the prefrontal cortex. Twelve elderly MCI patients and twelve healthy people were recruited as target and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. Each group went through an fNIRS scanning procedure three times: The initial data were obtained without any ATs, and subsequently a total of 24 AT sessions were conducted for MCI patients (i.e., MCI-0: the data prior to ATs, MCI-1: after 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks, MCI-2: another 12 sessions of ATs for 6 weeks). The mean HR responses of all MCI-0~2 cases were lower than those of HCs. To compare the effects of AT on MCI patients, MoCA-K results, temporal HR data, and spatial activation patterns (i.e., t-maps) were examined. In addition, analyses of functional connectivity and graph theory upon WM tasks were conducted. With ATs, i) the averaged MoCA-K test scores were improved (MCI-1, p = 0.002; MCI-2, p = 2.9e-4); ii) the mean HR response of WM tasks were increased (p &lt; 0.001); and iii) the t-maps of MCI-1 and MCI-2 were enhanced. Furthermore, an increased functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex in both MCI-1/MCI-2 cases in comparison to MCI-0 was obtained (p &lt; 0.01), and an increasing trend in the graph theory parameters was observed. All these findings reveal that ATs have a positive impact on improving the cognitive function of MCI patients. In conclusion, ATs can be used as a therapeutic tool for MCI patients as a nonpharmacological method. (Clinical trial registration number: KCT 0002451, https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/)

Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. They play key roles in brain development and physiology during life and aging. Equipped with a variety of molecular sensors and through the various functions they can fulfil, they are critically involved in maintaining the brainâs homeostasis. 
In Alzheimer disease (AD), microglia reaction was initially thought to be incidental and triggered by amyloid deposits and dystrophic neurites. However, recent genome-wide association studies have established that the majority of AD risk loci are found in or near genes that are highly and sometimes uniquely expressed in microglia. This leads to the concept of microglia being critically involved in the early steps of the disease and identified them as important potential therapeutic targets. Whether microglia reaction is beneficial, detrimental or both to AD progression is still unclear and the subject of intense debate. 
In this review, we are presenting a state-of-knowledge report intended to highlight the variety of microglial functions and pathways shown to be critically involved in AD progression. We first address both the acquisition of new functions and the alteration of their homeostatic roles by reactive microglia. Second, we propose a summary of new important parameters currently emerging in the field that need to be considered to identify relevant microglial targets. Finally, we discuss the many obstacles in designing efficient therapeutic strategies for AD and present innovative technologies that may foster our understanding of microglia roles in the pathology.
Ultimately, this work aims to fly over various microglial functions to make a general and reliable report of the current knowledge regarding microgliaâs involvement in AD and of the new research opportunities in the field.

The analysis of global and comparative genomics between different diseases allows us to understand the key biological processes that explain the etiology of these pathologies. We have used this type of approach to evaluate the expression of several neurodegeneration-related genes on the development of tumors, particularly brain tumors of glial origin (gliomas), which are an aggressive and incurable type of cancer. We have observed that genes involved in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, correlate with better prognosis of gliomas. Within these genes, high Tau/MAPT expression shows the strongest correlation with several indicators of prolonged survival on glioma patients. 
Tau protein regulates microtubule stability and dynamics in neurons, although there have been reports of its expression in glial cells and also in gliomas. However, little is known about the regulation of Tau/MAPT transcription in tumors. Moreover, our in silico analysis indicates that this gene is also expressed in a variety of tumors, showing a general correlation with survival, although its function in cancer has not yet been addressed. Another remarkable aspect of Tau is its involvement in resistance to taxanes in various tumors types such as breast, ovarian and gastric carcinomas. This is due to the fact that taxanes have the same tubulin-binding site as Tau. In the present work we review the main knowledge about Tau function and expression in tumors, with a special focus on brain cancer. We will also speculate with the therapeutic implications of these findings.

Despite much efforts in the last few decades, the mechanism of degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinsonâs disease (PD) remains unclear. This represents a major knowledge gap in idiopathic and genetic forms of PD. Among various possible key factors postulated, iron metabolism has been widely suggested to be involved with fueling oxidative stress, a known factor in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the correlation between iron and DA neuron loss, specifically in the SN, has not been described in experimental animal models with great detail, with most studies utilizing rodents and, rarely, non-human primates. In the present study, aiming to gain further evidence of a pathological role of iron in PD, we have examined the correlation of iron with DA neuron loss in a non-human primate model of PD induced by MPTP. We report a significant iron accumulation accompanied by both DA degeneration in the SN and motor deficits in the monkey that displayed the most severe PD pathology and behavioral deficits. The other two monkeys subjected to MPTP displayed less severe PD pathologies and motor deficits, however, their SN iron levels were significantly lower than controls. These findings suggest that high iron may indicate and contribute to heightened MPP+-induced PD pathology in late or severe stages of PD, while depressed levels of iron may signal an early stage of disease. Similarly, using a cell culture preparation, we have found that high dose of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), a factor known to enhance iron accumulation, increased MPP+-induced cell death in U251 and SH-SY5Y cells, and even in control cells. However, at low dose FAC restored or increased the viability of U251 and SH-SY5Y cells in the absence or presence of MPP+. These observations imply that high levels of iron likely contribute to or heighten MPP+ toxicity in the later stages of PD. While we report reduced iron levels in the earlier stages of MPTP induced PD, the significance of these changes remains to be determined.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48494">Velocity coupling of grid modules enables stable embedding of a low dimensional variable in a high dimensional attractor</a></h4>

Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode position using a distributed representation across multiple neural populations (modules), each possessing a distinct spatial scale. The modular structure of the representation confers the grid cell neural code with large capacity. Yet, the modularity poses significant challenges for the neural circuitry that maintains the representation, and updates it based on self motion. Small incompatible drifts in different modules, driven by noise, can rapidly lead to large, abrupt shifts in the represented position, resulting in catastrophic readout errors. Here we propose a theoretical model of coupled modules. The coupling suppresses incompatible drifts, allowing for a stable embedding of a two dimensional variable (position) in a higher dimensional neural attractor, while preserving the large capacity. We propose that coupling of this type may be implemented by recurrent synaptic connectivity within the mEC with a relatively simple and biologically plausible structure.

Planar supported lipid bilayers (PSLBs) presenting T cell receptor (TCR) ligands and ICAM-1 induce budding of extracellular microvesicles enriched in functional TCR, defined here as synaptic ectosomes (SE), from helper T cells. SE bind peptide-MHC directly exporting TCR into the synaptic cleft, but incorporation of other effectors is unknown. Here, we utilized bead supported lipid bilayers (BSLB) to capture SE from single immunological synapses (IS), determined SE composition by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and enriched SE for proteomic analysis by particle sorting. We demonstrate selective enrichment of CD40L and ICOS in SE in response to addition of CD40 and ICOSL, respectively, to SLB presenting TCR ligands and ICAM-1. SE are enriched in tetraspanins, BST-2, TCR signalling and ESCRT proteins. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrated that CD40L is present in microclusters within CD81 defined SE that are spatially segregated from TCR/ICOS/BST-2. CD40L<sup>+</sup> SE retain the capacity to induce dendritic cell maturation and cytokine production.

<p>by Jacob Bradford, Dimitri Perrin</p>

The popularity of CRISPR-based gene editing has resulted in an abundance of tools to design CRISPR-Cas9 guides. This is also driven by the fact that designing highly specific and efficient guides is a crucial, but not trivial, task in using CRISPR for gene editing. Here, we thoroughly analyse the performance of 18 design tools. They are evaluated based on runtime performance, compute requirements, and guides generated. To achieve this, we implemented a method for auditing system resources while a given tool executes, and tested each tool on datasets of increasing size, derived from the mouse genome. We found that only five tools had a computational performance that would allow them to analyse an entire genome in a reasonable time, and without exhausting computing resources. There was wide variation in the guides identified, with some tools reporting every possible guide while others filtered for predicted efficiency. Some tools also failed to exclude guides that would target multiple positions in the genome. We also considered two collections with over a thousand guides each, for which experimental data is available. There is a lot of variation in performance between the datasets, but the relative order of the tools is partially conserved. Importantly, the most striking result is a lack of consensus between the tools. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas9 guide design tools need further work in order to achieve rapid whole-genome analysis and that improvements in guide design will likely require combining multiple approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SGz378EC-0E" width="1" />

<p>by Vincent Miele, Christian Guill, Rodrigo Ramos-Jiliberto, Sonia KÃ©fi</p>

Ecological communities are undeniably diverse, both in terms of the species that compose them as well as the type of interactions that link species to each other. Despite this long recognition of the coexistence of multiple interaction types in nature, little is known about the consequences of this diversity for community functioning. In the ongoing context of global change and increasing species extinction rates, it seems crucial to improve our understanding of the drivers of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multispecies dynamical model of ecological communities including various interaction types (e.g. competition for space, predator interference, recruitment facilitation in addition to feeding), we studied the role of the presence and the intensity of these interactions for species diversity, community functioning (biomass and production) and the relationship between diversity and functioning.Taken jointly, the diverse interactions have significant effects on species diversity, whose amplitude and sign depend on the type of interactions involved and their relative abundance. They however consistently increase the slope of the relationship between diversity and functioning, suggesting that species losses might have stronger effects on community functioning than expected when ignoring the diversity of interaction types and focusing on feeding interactions only.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sqAaB1F5OzU" width="1" />

<p>by Diego Pereira Botelho, Kathleen Curran, Madeleine M. Lowery</p>

This study presents a modelling framework in which information on muscle fiber direction and orientation during contraction is derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and incorporated in a computational model of the surface electromyographic (EMG) signal. The proposed model makes use of the principle of reciprocity to simultaneously calculate the electric potentials produced at the recording electrode by charges distributed along an arbitrary number of muscle fibers within the muscle, allowing for a computationally efficient evaluation of extracellular motor unit action potentials. The approach is applied to the complex architecture of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the hand to simulate EMG during index finger flexion and abduction. Using diffusion tensor imaging methods, the results show how muscle fiber orientation and curvature in this intrinsic hand muscle change during flexion and abduction. Incorporation of anatomically accurate muscle architecture and other hand tissue morphologies enable the model to capture variations in extracellular action potential waveform shape across the motor unit population and to predict experimentally observed differences in EMG signal features when switching from index finger abduction to flexion. The simulation results illustrate how structural and electrical properties of the tissues comprising the volume conductor, in combination with fiber direction and curvature, shape the detected action potentials. Using the model, the relative contribution of motor units of different sizes located throughout the muscle under both conditions is examined, yielding a prediction of the detection profile of the surface EMG electrode array over the muscle cross-section.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EXeNVLB8m5g" width="1" />

<p>by Moshe Glickman, Orian Sharoni, Dino J. Levy, Ernst Niebur, Veit Stuphorn, Marius Usher</p>

A key question in decision-making is how people integrate amounts and probabilities to form preferences between risky alternatives. Here we rely on the general principle of integration-to-boundary to develop several biologically plausible process models of risky-choice, which account for both choices and response-times. These models allowed us to contrast two influential competing theories: i) within-alternative evaluations, based on multiplicative interaction between amounts and probabilities, ii) within-attribute comparisons across alternatives. To constrain the preference formation process, we monitored eye-fixations during decisions between pairs of simple lotteries, designed to systematically span the decision-space. The behavioral results indicate that the participants' eye-scanning patterns were associated with risk-preferences and expected-value maximization. Crucially, model comparisons showed that within-alternative process models decisively outperformed within-attribute ones, in accounting for choices and response-times. These findings elucidate the psychological processes underlying preference formation when making risky-choices, and suggest that compensatory, within-alternative integration is an adaptive mechanism employed in human decision-making.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vr_3X_Up3L8" width="1" />

<p>by Laura W. Pomeroy, Hyeyoung Kim, Ningchuan Xiao, Mark Moritz, Rebecca Garabed</p>

The dynamics of infectious diseases are greatly influenced by the movement of both susceptible and infected hosts. To accurately represent disease dynamics among a mobile host population, detailed movement models have been coupled with disease transmission models. However, a number of different host movement models have been proposed, each with their own set of assumptions and results that differ from the other models. Here, we compare two movement models coupled to the same disease transmission model using network analyses. This application of network analysis allows us to evaluate the fit and accuracy of the movement model in a multilevel modeling framework with more detail than established statistical modeling fitting methods. We used data that detailed mobile pastoralistsâ movements as input for 100 stochastic simulations of a Spatio-Temporal Movement (STM) model and 100 stochastic simulations of an Individual Movement Model (IMM). Both models represent dynamic movement and subsequent contacts. We generated networks in which nodes represent camps and edges represent the distance between camps. We simulated pathogen transmission over these networks and tested five network metricsâstrength, betweenness centrality, three-step reach, density, and transitivityâto determine which could predict disease simulation outcomes and thereby be used to correlate model simulation results with disease transmission simulations. We found that strength, network density, and three-step reach of movement model results correlated with the final epidemic size of outbreak simulations. Betweenness centrality only weakly correlated for the IMM model. Transitivity only weakly correlated for the STM model and time-varying IMM model metrics. We conclude that movement models coupled with disease transmission models can affect disease transmission results and should be carefully considered and vetted when modeling pathogen spread in mobile host populations. Strength, network density, and three-step reach can be used to evaluate movement models before disease simulations to predict final outbreak sizes. These findings can contribute to the analysis of multilevel models across systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LyLfyrIW4eQ" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Social recognition in mammals depends on complex interactions between sensory and other brain areas as well as modulatory inputs by specific neuropeptides such as oxytocin (OXT). Social recognition memory specifically has been shown to depend among others on olfactory processing, and can be probed using methods similar to those used when probing non-social odor memory. We here use a computational model of two interconnected olfactory networks in the mouse, the olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior olfactory nucleus, to propose a mechanism for olfactory short-term recognition memory and its modulation in social situations. Based on previous experiments, we propose one early locus for memory to be the OB. During social encounters in mice, pyramidal cells in the anterior olfactory nucleus, themselves driven by olfactory input, are rendered more excitable by OXT release, resulting in stronger feedback to OB local interneurons. This additional input to the OB creates stronger dynamics and improves signal-to-noise ratio of odor responses in the OB proper. As a consequence, mouse social olfactory memories are more strongly encoded and their duration is modulated.</p>

Abstract
<p>The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating postinjury neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus remain undefined. We have previously demonstrated that preinjury treatment with anti-microRNA (miR)-181a preserved neurons and prevented astrocyte dysfunction in the hippocampal cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) following transient forebrain ischemia. In the present study, we assessed postinjury treatment with anti-miR-181a on recovery of CA1 neurons following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Stereotactic CA1 injection of miR-181a antagomir at either 2 h or 7 d postinjury resulted in improved restoration of CA1 measured at 28 d postinjury. Treatment with antagomir was associated with overexpression of the mir-181a target cell adhesion-associated, oncogene-related protein and enhanced expression of the neuroprogenitor cell marker doublecortin (DCX) in the CA1. Assessment of GFAP<sup>+</sup> cell fate by Cre/Lox-mediated deletion demonstrated that some GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in CA1 exhibited <i>de novo</i> DCX expression in response to injury. <i>In vitro</i> experiments using primary neuronal stem cells confirmed that miR-181a inhibition augmented the expression of DCX and directed cellular differentiation toward a neuronal fate. These results suggest that miR-181a inhibition plays a central role in the restoration of CA1 neurons via augmentation of early latent neurogenic gene activation in neural progenitor cells, including some reactive astrocytes. Therapeutic interventions targeting this restorative process may represent a novel postinjury approach to improve clinical outcomes in survivors of forebrain ischemia.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with subsequent diagnoses of Parkinson disease, and whether these associations are similar in magnitude to those with subsequent diagnoses of Alzheimer disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a retrospective cohort study using claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 to 2015. The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for timeâdependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of 5.2âyears, 15,531 (1.5%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.39â1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>The N400 is an Event Related Potential that is evoked in response to
conceptually meaningful stimuli. It is for instance more negative in response
to incongruent than congruent words in a sentence, and more negative for
unrelated than related words following a prime word. This sensitivity to
semantic content of a stimulus in relation to the mental context of an
individual makes it a signal of interest for Brain Computer Interfaces. Given
this potential it is notable that the BCI literature exploiting the N400 is
limited. We identify three existing application areas: (1) exploiting the
semantic processing of faces to enhance matrix speller performance, (2)
detecting language processing in patients with Disorders of Consciousness, and
(3) using semantic stimuli to probe what is on a user's mind. Drawing on
studies from these application areas, we illustrate that the N400 can
successfully be exploited for BCI purposes, but that the signal-to-noise ratio
is a limiting factor, with signal strength also varying strongly across
subjects. Furthermore, we put findings in context of the general N400
literature, noting open questions and identifying opportunities for further
research.

<p>Graph theoretical approach has proved an effective tool to understand,
characterize and quantify the complex brain network. However, much less
attention has been paid to methods that quantitatively compare two graphs, a
crucial issue in the context of brain networks. Comparing brain networks is
indeed mandatory in several network neuroscience applications. Here, we discuss
the current state of the art, challenges, and a collection of analysis tools
that have been developed in recent years to compare brain networks. We first
introduce the graph similarity problem in brain network application. We then
describe the methodological background of the available metrics and algorithms
of comparing graphs, their strengths and limitations. We also report results
obtained in concrete applications from normal brain networks. More precisely,
we show the potential use of brain network similarity to build a 'network of
networks' that may give new insights into the object categorization in the
human brain. Additionally, we discuss future directions in terms of network
similarity methods and applications.

<p>Multi-articulate prosthetic hands are capable of performing dexterous hand
movements. However, clinically available control strategies fail to provide
users with intuitive, independent and proportional control over multiple
degrees of freedom (DOFs) in real time. Here, we detail the use of a modified
Kalman filter to provide intuitive, independent and proportional real-time
control over six-DOF prosthetic hands such as the DEKA LUKE Arm. Input features
include neural firing rates recorded from Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays and
mean absolute value of intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Ad-hoc
modifications include thresholds and non-unity gains on the output of the
Kalman filter. We demonstrate that both neural and EMG data can be combined
effectively to improve control. We also highlight that thresholds significantly
reduce unintended movements and promote more independent control of the
different DOFs. Optimal threshold values can be determined quickly offline and
translate to functional improvements online. In contrast to traditional pattern
recognition control schemes, the modified Kalman filter allows users to
continuously modulate their force output, which is critical for fine dexterity.
In less than five minutes of training, amputees were able to successfully
control in real time a multi-articulate prosthetic arm (hand and wrist) to
perform various activities of daily living. Preliminary implementation of the
modified Kalman filter onto a portable, take-home system further demonstrates
feasibility of the algorithm as a way to explore the functional and
psychological benefits associated with long-term, at-home control of dexterous
prosthetic hands.

<p>The aim of a number of psychophysics tasks is to uncover how mammals make
decisions in a world that is in flux. Here we examine the characteristics of
ideal and near-ideal observers in a task of this type. We ask when and how
performance depends on task parameters and design, and, in turn, what observer
performance tells us about their decision-making process. In the dynamic clicks
task subjects hear two streams (left and right) of Poisson clicks with
different rates. Subjects are rewarded when they correctly identify the side
with the higher rate, as this side switches unpredictably. We show that a
reduced set of task parameters defines regions in parameter space in which
optimal, but not near-optimal observers, maintain constant response accuracy.
We also show that for a range of task parameters an approximate normative model
must be finely tuned to reach near-optimal performance, illustrating a
potential way to distinguish between normative models and their approximations.
In addition, we show that using the negative log-likelihood and the 0/1-loss
functions to fit these types of models is not equivalent: the 0/1-loss leads to
a bias in parameter recovery that increases with sensory noise. These findings
suggest ways to tease apart models that are hard to distinguish when tuned
exactly, and point to general pitfalls in experimental design, model fitting,
and interpretation of the resulting data.

Protein palmitoylation is the post-translational, reversible addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, to proteins. Protein palmitoylation has recently garnered much attention, as it robustly modifies the localization and function of canonical signaling molecules and receptors. Protein depalmitoylation, on the other hand, is the process by which palmitic acid is removed from modified proteins and contributes, therefore, comparably to palmitoylated-protein dynamics. Palmitoylated proteins also require depalmitoylation prior to lysosomal degradation, demonstrating the significance of this process in protein sorting and turnover. Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation serve as particularly crucial regulators of protein function in neurons, where a specialized molecular architecture and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains contribute to synaptic transmission. Three classes of depalmitoylating enzymes are currently recognized, the acyl protein thioesterases, ï¡/ï¢ hydrolase domain-containing 17 proteins, and the palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs). However, a clear picture of depalmitoylation has not yet emerged, in part because the enzyme-substrate relationships and specific functions of depalmitoylation are only beginning to be uncovered. Further, despite the finding that loss-of-function mutations affecting palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) function cause a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disease, the role of PPT1 as a depalmitoylase has attracted relatively little attention. Understanding the role of depalmitoylation by PPT1 in neuronal function is a fertile area for ongoing basic science and translational research that may have broader therapeutic implications for neurodegeneration. Here, we will briefly introduce the rapidly growing field surrounding protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, then will focus on the role of PPT1 in development, health, and neurological disease.

Chronic stress is a key risk factor for depression, and microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent studies show that the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is expressed in microglia and may play a crucial role in depression. However, the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampal microglia and its role in depressive-like behaviors remain poorly understood. In this study, rats were subjected to 6 h of restraint stress per day for 21 days to produce a model of stress-induced depression. Behavioral tests and serum corticosterone were used to assess the success of the model. Furthermore, HAPI cells were pretreated with dexamethasone (5 Ã 10-7 M) to assess stress-induced changes in microglial cells in culture. The microglial marker Iba-1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream inflammatory effectors (IL-1Î² and IL-18) were measured. Chronic stress induced depressive-like behavior, increased serum corticosterone levels and produced hippocampal structural changes. Chronic stress and dexamethasone both increased Iba-1 expression and ROS formation and also elevated levels of NF-ÎºB, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1Î² and IL-18. After use of the NF-ÎºB inhibitor BAY 117082 and knocked out NLRP3 in vitro decreased ROS formation and the expression of Iba-1, NF-ÎºB and NLRP3 as well as levels of cleaved caspase-1, IL-1Î² and IL-18. These findings suggest that activation of the glucocorticoid receptor-NF-ÎºB-NLRP3 pathway in hippocampal microglia mediates chronic stress-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and depression-like behavior.

As one of the most common causes of mortality and disability, traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes huge psychological and economic burden to patients, families, and societies worldwide. Neuroinflammation reduction may be a favorable option to alleviate secondary brain injuries and ameliorate the outcome of TBI. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been shown to be involved in TBI. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) has been identified as an essential mediator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is recruited upstream of the formation of inflammasomes in response to NLRP3 activators. However, the underlying mechanism by which NEK7 operates post-TBI remains undefined. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Using an in vivo mouse TBI model, mice were administered an intracerebroventricular injection of NEK7-shRNA virus. For the in vitro analysis, primary cortical neurons with NEK7-shRNA were stimulated with LPS/ATP or potassium (K+). We evaluated the effects of NEK7 knock-down on neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. During the 0â168 h post-TBI period in vivo, NEK7 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation increased in what appeared to be a time-dependent manner. As well as pyroptosis-related markers, caspase-1 activation (p20) and IL-1Î² activation (p17) were up-regulated. NEK7 down-regulation attenuated neurological deficits, NLRP3 inflammasomes, caspase-1 activation, and neuronal injury. The same phenomena were observed during the in vitro experiments. Furthermore, NEK7 knock-down abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which were triggered by K+ efflux, and the LPS + ATP-triggered NEK7-NLRP3 complex was reversed in primary cortical neurons placed in 50 mM K+ medium. Collectively, the data demonstrated that NEK7, is a modulator, regulates NLRP3 inflammasomes and downstream neuroinflammation in response to K+ efflux, through NEK7-NLRP3 assembly, pro-caspase-1 recruitment, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis in nerve injuries, post-TBI. NEK7 may be a potential therapeutic target for attenuating neuroinflammation and nerve injury post-TBI.

These are exciting times for research on adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Debate and controversy regarding the existence of generation of new neurons in the adult, and even diseased human brain flourishes as articles against and in favor accumulate. Adult neurogenesis in the human brain is a phenomenon that does not share the qualities of quantum mechanics. The scientific community should agree that human AHN exists or does not, but not both at the same time. In this commentary, we discuss the latest research articles about hAHN and what their findings imply for the neurogenesis field.

The excitatory neurons in the visual cortex are of great significance for us to understand brain functions. However, the diverse neuron types and their morphological properties have not been fully deciphered. In this paper, we have applied the brain-wide positioning system (BPS) to image the entire brain of Thy1-eYFP H-line mouse at 0.2 Ã 0.2 Ã 1 Î¼m3 voxel resolution. A total of 92 neurons have been reconstructed in the layers 5 and 6 of visual cortex with single-axon level resolution. Based on the complete topological of neurons and the inherent positioning function of imaging, we have classified the observed neurons as 6 types according to their apical dendrites and somataâs location. They are star pyramidal cell in layer 5 (L5-sp), slender-tufted pyramidal cell in layer 5 (L5-st), tufted pyramidal cell in layer 5 (L5-tt), spiny stellate-like cell in layer 6 (L6-ss), star pyramidal cell in layer 6 (L6-sp), and slender-tufted pyramidal cell in layer 6 (L6-st). By examining the projection patterns of individual neurons, they can be categorized into three modes: circuit connection neurons (ICCN), callosal projection neurons (CPN) and corticofugal projection neurons (CFuPN). Correlating the two kinds of classifications, we have found that there are at least two projection modes comprised in the former defined neuron types except L5-tt. On the other hand, each projection mode may consist of 4 dendritic types defined in this study. The axon projection mode just partially correlates with the apical dendrite feature. This work has demonstrated a paradigm to resolve visual cortex by single neuron quantification, and shown the potential to be extended to reveal the connectome of other defined sensory or motor system.

There are increased risks for deglutition disorders in people with Down Syndrome (DS).  Although mouse models have been used to study the biological underpinnings of DS in other areas, relatively little is known about swallowing phenotypes in these models. We hypothesized that swallowing performance would be affected in adult mouse models of DS, relative to typical control mice. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) were conducted on adults of two mouse models of DS: Ts65Dn and Dp(16)1Yey, and evaluated in comparison with age-matched controls. Relative to other groups, adult Ts65Dn showed significantly slower swallow rates, longer inter-swallow intervals (ISI), and greater numbers of jaw excursion cycles preceding each swallow. In contrast, adult Dp(16)1Yey mice showed swallowing performance similar to control mice. Exploratory quantitative analyses of the intrinsic tongue (transverse muscle), and extrinsic tongue muscles (genioglossus, styloglossus, hyoglossus) showed no significant differences between genotype groups in myosin heavy chain isoform profiles. Collectively, these findings suggest that while swallowing is typical in adult Dp(16)1Yey, swallowing in adult Ts65Dn is atypical due to unknown causes. The finding that adult Ts65Dn may have utility as a model of dysphagia provides new opportunities to elucidate biological underpinnings of dysphagia associated with DS.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00905">Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 Is Associated With Activation of the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus and Stress-Related Gastrointestinal Dysmotility</a></h4>

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a molecule associated with familial and sporadic Parkinsonâs disease. It regulates many central neuronal functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and axonal extension. Recently, it has been revealed that LRRK2 is related to anxiety/depression-like behavior, implying an association between LRRK2 and stress. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the stress pathway and its relationship to gastrointestinal motility in LRRK2-knockout (KO) mice. The mice were subjected to acute restraint stress, and analyzed for activation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) using an immunohistochemical approach. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was assessed by Western blotting. The KO mice showed a lower number of c-Fos-positive cells and disruption of the ERK signaling pathway in the PVN in the presence of restraint stress. Stress responses in terms of both upper and lower gastrointestinal motility were alleviated in the mice, accompanied by lower c-Fos immunoreactivity in enteric excitatory neurons. Our present findings suggest that LRRK2 is a newly recognized molecule regulating the stress pathway in the PVN, playing a role in stress-related gastrointestinal dysmotility.

Background: Differentiation of large vessel occlusion caused by intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) or intracranial embolism significantly impacts the course of treatment (i.e., intravenous thrombolysis versus mechanical thrombectomy) for acute cerebral infarction. Currently, there is no objective evidence to indicate ICAS-related middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion before treatment. In cases of ICAS, it is often observed that the infarct core caused by ICAS-related M1 segment middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is located in deeper parts of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region). 
Objective: To evaluate whether the location of the infarct core, identified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), can be used to differentiate ICAS from intracranial embolism. 
Methods: Thirty-one consecutive patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction caused by middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion were retrospectively included based on angiographic findings to distinguish ICAS from embolic occlusion. Patients were divided into two groups based on the location of the infarct core on DWI: in the deep part of the brain (basal ganglia or semiovoid region) or more superficially (i.e., cortex). 
Results: In 16 patients, the infarct core was mainly in the deep part of the brain on DWI (14 of 16 patients in the ICAS group and only 2 in the non-ICAS group [93.3% versus 6.7%, respectively; P&lt;0.001]). The diagnostic sensitivity of DWI for ICAS was 93.3%, with a specificity of 87.5%, a PPV of 87.5%, and an NPV of 93.3%, the accuracy was 88.5%. 
Conclusion: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease-related acute MCAO can be predicted using DWI.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00059">Distinct Mechanism of Audiovisual Integration With Informative and Uninformative Sound in a Visual Detection Task: A DCM Study</a></h4>

Previous studies have shown that task-irrelevant auditory information can provide temporal clues for the detection of visual targets and improve visual perception; such sounds are called informative sounds. The neural mechanism of the integration of informative sound and visual stimulus has been investigated extensively, using behavioral measurement or neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP), but the dynamic processes of audiovisual integration cannot be characterized formally in terms of directed neuronal coupling. The present study adopts dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of fMRI data to identify changes in effective connectivity in the hierarchical brain networks that underwrite audiovisual integration and memory. This allows us to characterize context-sensitive changes in neuronal coupling and show how visual processing is contextualized by the processing of informative and uninformative sounds. Our results show that audiovisual integration with informative and uninformative sounds conforms to different optimal models in the two conditions, indicating distinct neural mechanisms of audiovisual integration. The findings also reveal that a sound is uninformative owing to low-level automatic audiovisual integration and informative owing to integration in high-level cognitive processes.

Anodal-transcranial pulsed current stimulation (a-tPCS) has been used in human studies to modulate cortical excitability or improve behavioral performance in recent years. Multiple studies show crucial roles of astrocytes in cortical plasticity. The calcium activity in astrocytes could regulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Whether the astrocytic activity is involved in a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity is presently unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the calcium responses in neurons and astrocytes evoked by a-tPCS with different current intensities, and thereby provides some indication of the mechanisms underlying a-tPCS-induced cortical plasticity. Two-photon calcium imaging was used to record the calcium responses of neurons and astrocytes in mouse somatosensory cortex. Local field potential (LFP) evoked by sensory stimulation was used to assess the effects of a-tPCS on plasticity. We found that long-duration a-tPCS with high-intensity current could evoke large-amplitude calcium responses in both neurons and astrocytes, whereas long-duration a-tPCS with low-intensity current evoked large-amplitude calcium responses only in astrocytes. The astrocytic Ca2+ elevations are driven by noradrenergic-dependent activation of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (A1ARs), while the intense Ca2+ responses of neurons are driven by action potentials. LFP recordings demonstrated that low-intensity a-tPCS led to enhancement of cortical excitability while high-intensity a-tPCS resulted in diminution of cortical excitability. The results provide some evidence that the enhancement of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be partly associated with calcium elevation in astrocytes, whereas the diminution of a-tPCS-induced cortical excitability might be caused by excessive calcium activity in neurons. These findings indicate that the appropriate current intensity should be used in the application of a-tPCS.

In this study we aimed to provide a neuroanatomy atlas derived from cross-sectional and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the encephalon of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). A postmortem brain analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI â 1,5T; a high-resolution submillimeter three-dimensional T1-3D  FFE) and cross-sectional macroscopic anatomy methods revealed major embryological and anatomical subdivisions of the encephalon, including the ventricular system. Most of the internal structures were comparably identifiable in both methods. The tractus olfactorius medialis, corpus subthalamicum, brachium colliculi rostralis, fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, nuclei vestibulares, velum medullare rostrale, nucleus fastigii, fasciculi cuneatus et gracilis were identified entirely by cross-sectional macroscopic analysis. However, the glandula pinealis, lemniscus lateralis and nuclei rhaphe were visualized only with MRI. Gross neuroanatomic analysis provided information about sulci and gyri of the cerebral hemispheres, components of the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres, and relative size and morphology of constituents of the rhinencephalon and cerebellum. Similarities and discrepancies in identification of structures provided by both methods, as well as hallmarks of the structures facilitating identification using these methods are discussed. Finally, we compare the brown bear encephalon with other carnivores and discuss most of the identified structures compared to those of the domestic dog, the domestic cat, Ursidae and Mustelidae families and Pinnipedia clade.

Numerous observational studies have shown that physical exercise promotes cognition in the elderly, however, the results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are ambiguous. In addition, potential benefits of exercise in an elderly Chinese population have not been comprehensively addressed. In this study, an investigation was launched which focused on the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive function, blood lipid profiles and brain anatomy in a non-dementia aging Chinese population. A total of 2074 non-dementia elderly subjects were included (self-selected exercise n=1372; self-selected non-exercise n=702). Amongst the subjects, 689 volunteered to receive blood lipid tests, 141 undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 1399 receive a 1 year cognitive evaluation follow-up. The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental States Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive function. A significant difference in cognitive function was observed at the baseline and during the one-year follow-up between the self-selected exercise and self-selected non-exercise groups, however, no significant differences in blood lipids and brain anatomy was evident. Physical exercise has a beneficial effect on cognition, particularly visuospatial function, and decreases the risk of dementia in a Chinese aging cohort.

Objective: This study was aimed to explore the effects of dietary nutrients on cognitive function among the middle-aged and elderly populations. 
Methods: A prospective cohort study of 1385 middle-aged and elderly people was conducted from January 2014 to December 2017. Dietary nutrients were assessed according to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and China Food Composition Database. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate the participantsâ global cognitive function. Six other neuropsychological measures (auditory verbal learning test-immediate recall (AVLT-IR), auditory verbal learning test-short recall (AVLT-SR), auditory verbal learning test-long recall (AVLT-LR), logical memory test (LMT), digit span forwards (DST-F) and digit span backwards (DST-B)) were used to assess the verbal memory domain and the attention domain by principal component analysis. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to explore associations between nutrients and cognition. Sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the results. 
Results: Dietary riboflavin was protective for global cognitive function (Î²=1.31, 95% CI: 0.26, 2.35) and the verbal memory domain (Î²=0.37, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.71). Unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) played a protective role in global cognitive function (Î²=1.15, 95% CI: 0.16, 2.14). The protective effects of riboflavin and USFA on cognitive function were consistent and reliable when different confounders were adjusted during sensitivity analyses. During the follow-up, neuropsychological measure scores revealed a reduced declines in the high riboflavin group (d-MoCA, P=0.025; d-AVLT-IR, P=0.001; d-DST-B, P=0.004 and d-composite score, P=0.004) and the high USFA group (d-AVLT-IR, P=0.007; d-LMT, P=0.032; d-DST-B, P=0.002 and d-composite score, P=0.008). 
Conclusion: Higher intake of riboflavin and USFA can improve multi-dimensional cognitive functioning in middle-aged and elderly people. These findings were consistent in different models of sensitivity analyses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50003">A structural mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of the AP2 complex</a></h4>

Endocytosis of transmembrane proteins is orchestrated by the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex. AP2 dwells in a closed, inactive state in the cytosol, but adopts an open, active conformation on the plasma membrane. Membrane-activated complexes are also phosphorylated, but the significance of this mark is debated. We recently proposed that NECAP negatively regulates AP2 by binding open and phosphorylated complexes (Beacham <i>et al</i>., 2018). Here, we report high-resolution cryo-EM structures of NECAP bound to phosphorylated AP2. The site of AP2 phosphorylation is directly coordinated by residues of the NECAP PHear domain that are predicted from genetic screens in <i>C. elegans</i>. Using membrane mimetics to generate conformationally open AP2, we find that a second domain of NECAP binds these complexes and cryo-EM reveals both domains of NECAP engaging closed, inactive AP2. Assays <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i> confirm these domains cooperate to inactivate AP2. We propose that phosphorylation marks adaptors for inactivation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48239">Evolution of asymmetric gamete signaling and suppressed recombination at the mating type locus</a></h4>

The two partners required for sexual reproduction are rarely the same. This pattern extends to species which lack sexual dimorphism yet possess self-incompatible gametes determined at mating-type regions of suppressed recombination, likely precursors of sex chromosomes. Here we investigate the role of cellular signaling in the evolution of mating-types. We develop a model of ligand-receptor dynamics, and identify factors that determine the capacity of cells to send and receive signals. The model specifies conditions favoring the evolution of gametes producing ligand and receptor asymmetrically and shows how these are affected by recombination. When the recombination rate evolves, the conditions favoring asymmetric signaling also favor tight linkage of ligand and receptor loci in distinct linkage groups. These results suggest that selection for asymmetric gamete signaling could be the first step in the evolution of non-recombinant mating-type loci, paving the road for the evolution of anisogamy and sexes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47596">Population response magnitude variation in inferotemporal cortex predicts image memorability</a></h4>

Most accounts of image and object encoding in inferotemporal cortex (IT) focus on the distinct patterns of spikes that different images evoke across the IT population. By analyzing data collected from IT as monkeys performed a visual memory task, we demonstrate that variation in a complementary coding scheme, the magnitude of the population response, can largely account for how well images will be remembered. To investigate the origin of IT image memorability modulation, we probed convolutional neural network models trained to categorize objects. We found that, like the brain, different natural images evoked different magnitude responses from these networks, and in higher layers, larger magnitude responses were correlated with the images that humans and monkeys find most memorable. Together, these results suggest that variation in IT population response magnitude is a natural consequence of the optimizations required for visual processing, and that this variation has consequences for visual memory.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46831">The cerebellum is involved in processing of predictions and prediction errors in a fear conditioning paradigm</a></h4>

Prediction errors are thought to drive associative fear learning. Surprisingly little is known about the possible contribution of the cerebellum. To address this question, healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm during 7T magnetic resonance imaging. An event-related design allowed us to separate cerebellar fMRI signals related to the visual conditioned stimulus (CS) from signals related to the subsequent unconditioned stimulus (US; an aversive electric shock). We found significant activation of cerebellar lobules Crus I and VI bilaterally related to the CS+ compared to the CS-. Most importantly, significant activation of lobules Crus I and VI was also present during the unexpected omission of the US in unreinforced CS+ acquisition trials. This activation disappeared during extinction when US omission became expected. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing predictions and prediction errors in the emotional domain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45909">Homology sensing via non-linear amplification of sequence dependent pausing by RecQ helicase</a></h4>

RecQ helicases promote genomic stability through their unique ability to suppress illegitimate recombination and resolve recombination intermediates. These DNA structure-specific activities of RecQ helicases are mediated by the helicase-and-RNAseD like C-terminal (HRDC) domain, via unknown mechanisms. Here, employing single-molecule magnetic tweezers and rapid kinetic approaches we establish that the HRDC domain stabilizes intrinsic, sequence-dependent, pauses of the core helicase (lacking the HRDC) in a DNA geometry-dependent manner. We elucidate the core unwinding mechanism in which the unwinding rate depends on the stability of the duplex DNA leading to transient sequence-dependent pauses. We further demonstrate a non-linear amplification of these transient pauses by the controlled binding of the HRDC domain. The resulting DNA sequence- and geometry-dependent pausing may underlie a homology sensing mechanism that allows rapid disruption of unstable (illegitimate) and stabilization of stable (legitimate) DNA strand invasions, which suggests an intrinsic mechanism of recombination quality control by RecQ helicases.

<p>by Jonathan Yaacov Weinstein, Assaf Elazar, Sarel Jacob Fleishman</p>

Membrane-protein design is an exciting and increasingly successful research area which has led to landmarks including the design of stable and accurate membrane-integral proteins based on coiled-coil motifs. Design of topologically more complex proteins, such as most receptors, channels, and transporters, however, demands an energy function that balances contributions from intra-protein contacts and protein-membrane interactions. Recent advances in water-soluble all-atom energy functions have increased the accuracy in structure-prediction benchmarks. The plasma membrane, however, imposes different physical constraints on protein solvation. To understand these constraints, we recently developed a high-throughput experimental screen, called dsTÎ²L, and inferred apparent insertion energies for each amino acid at dozens of positions across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we express these profiles as lipophilicity energy terms in Rosetta and demonstrate that the new energy function outperforms previous ones in modelling and design benchmarks. Rosetta ab initio simulations starting from an extended chain recapitulate two-thirds of the experimentally determined structures of membrane-spanning homo-oligomers with &lt;2.5Ã root-mean-square deviation within the top-predicted five models (available online: http://tmhop.weizmann.ac.il). Furthermore, in two sequence-design benchmarks, the energy function improves discrimination of stabilizing point mutations and recapitulates natural membrane-protein sequences of known structure, thereby recommending this new energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T_qB0aDySLA" width="1" />

<p>by Eva S. Deutekom, Julian Vosseberg, Teunis J. P. van Dam, Berend Snel</p>

In recent years it became clear that in eukaryotic genome evolution gene loss is prevalent over gene gain. However, the absence of genes in an annotated genome is not always equivalent to the loss of genes. Due to sequencing issues, or incorrect gene prediction, genes can be falsely inferred as absent. This implies that loss estimates are overestimated and, more generally, that falsely inferred absences impact genomic comparative studies. However, reliable estimates of how prevalent this issue is are lacking. Here we quantified the impact of gene prediction on gene loss estimates in eukaryotes by analysing 209 phylogenetically diverse eukaryotic organisms and comparing their predicted proteomes to that of their respective six-frame translated genomes. We observe that 4.61% of domains per species were falsely inferred to be absent for Pfam domains predicted to have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Between phylogenetically different categories this estimate varies substantially: for clade-specific loss (ancestral loss) we found 1.30% and for species-specific loss 16.88% to be falsely inferred as absent. For BUSCO 1-to-1 orthologous families, 18.30% were falsely inferred to be absent. Finally, we showed that falsely inferred absences indeed impact loss estimates, with the number of losses decreasing by 11.78%. Our work strengthens the increasing number of studies showing that gene loss is an important factor in eukaryotic genome evolution. However, while we demonstrate that on average inferring gene absences from predicted proteomes is reliable, caution is warranted when inferring species-specific absences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GgFSVT6Nngo" width="1" />

<p>by Thi Mui Pham, Mirjam Kretzschmar, Xavier Bertrand, Martin Bootsma, on behalf of COMBACTE-MAGNET Consortium </p>

<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Understanding how this multi-drug resistant pathogen is transmitted within intensive care units (ICUs) is crucial for devising and evaluating successful control strategies. While it is known that moist environments serve as natural reservoirs for <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, there is little quantitative evidence regarding the contribution of environmental contamination to its transmission within ICUs. Previous studies on other nosocomial pathogens rely on deploying specific values for environmental parameters derived from costly and laborious genotyping. Using solely longitudinal surveillance data, we estimated the relative importance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> transmission routes by exploiting the fact that different routes cause different pattern of fluctuations in the prevalence. We developed a mathematical model including background transmission, cross-transmission and environmental contamination. Patients contribute to a pool of pathogens by shedding bacteria to the environment. Natural decay and cleaning of the environment lead to a reduction of that pool. By assigning the bacterial load shed during an ICU stay to cross-transmission, we were able to disentangle environmental contamination during and after a patientâs stay. Based on a data-augmented Markov Chain Monte Carlo method the relative importance of the considered acquisition routes is determined for two ICUs of the University hospital in BesanÃ§on (France). We used information about the admission and discharge days, screening days and screening results of the ICU patients. Both background and cross-transmission play a significant role in the transmission process in both ICUs. In contrast, only about 1% of the total transmissions were due to environmental contamination after discharge. Based on longitudinal surveillance data, we conclude that cleaning improvement of the environment after discharge might have only a limited impact regarding the prevention of <i>P.A.</i> infections in the two considered ICUs of the University hospital in BesanÃ§on. Our model was developed for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> but can be easily applied to other pathogens as well.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/whHiqG5qldg" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Brain imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of recovery after early brain insult. The assumption that the unaffected right hemisphere can take over language functions after left perinatal stroke is still under debate. Here, we report how patterns of brain structural and functional reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of four-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Specifically, we gathered specific fine-grained developmental measures of receptive and productive aspects of language as well as standardized measures of cognitive development. We also collected structural neuroimaging data as well as functional activations during a passive listening story-telling fMRI task and a resting state session (rs-fMRI). Children with a left perinatal stroke showed larger lateralization indices of both structural and functional connectivity of the dorsal language pathway towards the right hemisphere that, in turn, were associated with better language outcomes. Importantly, the pattern of structural asymmetry was significantly more right-lateralized in children with a left perinatal brain insult than in a group of matched healthy controls. These results strongly suggest that early lesions of the left dorsal pathway and the associated perisylvian regions can induce the interhemispheric transfer of language functions to right homolog regions. This study provides combined evidence of structural and functional brain reorganization of language networks after early stroke with strong implications for neurobiological models of language development.</p>

<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common form of medically refractory epilepsy in adults, is usually associated with hippocampal pathophysiology. Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that &gt;4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with &gt;4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Consistent with morphological and electrophysiological studies suggesting aberrant adult-generated neurons contribute to epilepsy development, ablation of seizure-induced new neurons at the time of the initial insult reduces the frequency of recurrent seizures. In this study, we show that continuous targeting of post-insult new neurons in a therapeutically relevant time period reduces chronic seizures; however, this effect does not persist suggesting possible additional mechanisms.</p>

<p>Although the reduction of viral loads in people with HIV undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy has mitigated AIDS-related symptoms, the prevalence of neurological impairments has remained unchanged. HIV-associated CNS dysfunction includes impairments in memory, attention, memory processing, and retrieval. Here, we show a significant site-specific increase in the phosphorylation of Syn I serine 9, site 1, in the frontal cortex lysates and synaptosome preparations of male rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) but not in uninfected or SIV-infected antiretroviral therapy animals. Furthermore, we found that a lower protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, a phosphatase responsible for Syn I (S9) dephosphorylation, is primarily associated with the higher S9 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex of SIV-infected macaques. Comparison of brain sections confirmed higher Syn I (S9) in the frontal cortex and greater coexpression of Syn I and PP2A A subunit, which was observed as perinuclear aggregates in the somata of the frontal cortex of SIV-infected macaques. Synaptosomes from SIV-infected animals were physiologically tested using a synaptic vesicle endocytosis assay and FM4â64 dye showing a significantly higher baseline depolarization levels in synaptosomes of SIV<sup>+</sup>-infected than uninfected control or antiretroviral therapy animals. A PP2A-activating FDA-approved drug, FTY720, decreased the higher synaptosome depolarization in SIV-infected animals. Our results suggest that an impaired distribution and lower activity of serine/threonine phosphatases in the context of HIV infection may cause an indirect effect on the phosphorylation levels of essential proteins involving in synaptic transmission, supporting the occurrence of specific impairments in the synaptic activity during SIV infection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Even with antiretroviral therapy, neurocognitive deficits, including impairments in attention, memory processing, and retrieval, are still major concerns in people living with HIV. Here, we used the rhesus macaque simian immunodeficiency virus model with and without antiretroviral therapy to study the dynamics of phosphorylation of key amino acid residues of synapsin I, which critically impacts synaptic vesicle function. We found a significant increase in synapsin I phosphorylation at serine 9, which was driven by dysfunction of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A in the nerve terminals. Our results suggest that an impaired distribution and lower activity of serine/threonine phosphatases in the context of HIV infection may cause an indirect effect on the phosphorylation levels of essential proteins involved in synaptic transmission.</p>

<p>APP, whose mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), modulates neurotransmission via interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with the synaptic release machinery. Here we identified an intravesicular domain of APP, called intraluminal SV-APP interacting domain (ISVAID), which interacts with glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, synaptic vesicle proteins. ISVAID contains the Î²- and Î±-secretase cleavage sites of APP: proteomic analysis of the interactome of ISVAID suggests that Î²- and Î±-secretase cleavage of APP cuts inside the interaction domain of ISVAID and destabilizes proteinâprotein interactions. We have tested the functional significance of the ISVAID and of Î²-/Î±-secretase-processing of APP using various ISVAID-derived peptides in competition experiments on both female and male mouse and rats hippocampal slices. A peptide encompassing the entire ISVAID facilitated glutamate, but not GABA, release acting as dominant negative inhibitor of the functions of this APP domain in acute hippocampal slices. In contrast, peptides representing the product of Î²-/Î±-secretase-processing of ISVAID did not alter excitatory neurotransmitter release. These findings suggest that cleavage of APP by either Î²- or Î±-secretase may inactivate the ISVAID, thereby enhancing glutamate release. Our present data support the notion that APP tunes glutamate release, likely through intravesicular and extravesicular interactions with synaptic vesicle proteins and the neurotransmitter release machinery, and that Î²-/Î± cleavage of APP facilitates the release of excitatory neurotransmitter.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease has been linked to mutations in APP. However, the biological function of APP is poorly understood. Here we show that an intravesicular APP domain interacts with the proteins that control the release of glutamate, but not GABA. Interfering with the function of this domain promotes glutamate release. This APP domain contains the sites cleaved by Î²- and Î±-secretases: our data suggest that Î²-/Î± cleavage of APP inactivates this functional APP domain promoting excitatory neurotransmitter release.</p>

<p>Time locking between neocortical sleep slow oscillations, thalamo-cortical spindles, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples has convincingly been shown to be a key element of systems consolidation. Here we investigate the role of monosynaptic projections from ventral/intermediate hippocampus to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in sleep-dependent memory consolidation in male mice. Following acquisition learning in the Barnes maze, we optogenetically silenced the axonal terminals of hippocampal projections within mPFC during slow-wave sleep. This silencing during SWS selectively impaired recent but not remote memory in the absence of effects on error rate and escape latencies. Furthermore, it prevented the development of the most efficient search strategy and sleep spindle time-locking to slow oscillation. An increase in post-learning sleep sharp-wave ripple (SPWR) density and reduced time locking of learning-associated SPWR activity to sleep spindles may be a less specific response. Our results demonstrate that monosynaptic projections from hippocampus to mPFC contribute to sleep-dependent memory consolidation, potentially by affecting the temporal coupling of sleep-associated electrophysiological events.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Convincing evidence supports the role of slow-wave sleep (SWS), and the relevance of close temporal coupling of neuronal activity between brain regions for systems consolidation. Less attention has been paid so far to the specific neuronal pathways underlying these processes. Here, we optogenetically silenced the direct monosynaptic projection from ventral/intermediate hippocampus (HC) to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during SWS in male mice following repeated learning trials in a weakly aversive spatial task. Our results confirm the concept that the monosynaptic projection between HC and mPFC contributes to memory consolidation and support an important functional role of this pathway in shaping the temporal precision among sleep-associated electrophysiological events.</p>

<p>As a sequence of movements is learned, serially ordered actions get bound together into sets to reduce computational complexity during planning and execution. Here, we investigated how actions become naturally bound over the course of learning and how this learning affects cortical representations of individual actions. Across 5 weeks of practice, neurologically healthy human subjects learned either a complex 32-item sequence of finger movements (trained group, <i>n</i> = 9; 3 female) or randomly ordered actions (control group, <i>n</i> = 9; 3 female). Over the course of practice, responses during sequence production in the trained group became temporally correlated, consistent with responses being bound together under a common command. These behavioral changes, however, did not coincide with plasticity in the multivariate representations of individual finger movements, assessed using fMRI, at any level of the cortical motor hierarchy. This suggests that the representations of individual actions remain stable, even as the execution of those same actions become bound together in the context of producing a well learned sequence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Extended practice on motor sequences results in highly stereotyped movement patterns that bind successive movements together. This binding is critical for skilled motor performance, yet it is not currently understood how it is achieved in the brain. We examined how binding altered the patterns of activity associated with individual movements that make up the sequence. We found that fine finger control during sequence production involved correlated activity throughout multiple motor regions; however, we found no evidence for plasticity of the representations of elementary movements. This suggests that binding is associated with plasticity at a more abstract level of the motor hierarchy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/35/6953?rss=1">Learning What Is Irrelevant or Relevant: Expectations Facilitate Distractor Inhibition and Target Facilitation through Distinct Neural Mechanisms</a></h4>

<p>It is well known that attention can facilitate performance by top-down biasing processing of task-relevant information in advance. Recent findings from behavioral studies suggest that distractor inhibition is not under similar direct control but strongly dependent on expectations derived from previous experience. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. The current study addressed this outstanding question in three experiments in which search displays with repeating distractor or target locations across trials allowed human observers (male and female) to learn which location to selectively suppress or boost. Behavioral findings demonstrated that both distractor and target location learning resulted in more efficient search, as indexed by faster response times. Crucially, distractor learning benefits were observed without target location foreknowledge, unaffected by the number of possible target locations, and could not be explained by priming alone. To determine how distractor location expectations facilitated performance, we applied a spatial encoding model to EEG data to reconstruct activity in neural populations tuned to distractor or target locations. Target location learning increased neural tuning to target locations in advance, indicative of preparatory biasing. This sensitivity increased after target presentation. By contrast, distractor expectations did not change preparatory spatial tuning. Instead, distractor expectations reduced distractor-specific processing, as reflected in the disappearance of the Pd event-related potential component, a neural marker of distractor inhibition, and decreased decoding accuracy. These findings suggest that the brain may no longer process expected distractors as distractors, once it has learned they can safely be ignored.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We constantly try hard to ignore conspicuous events that distract us from our current goals. Surprisingly, and in contrast to dominant attention theories, ignoring distracting, but irrelevant, events does not seem to be as flexible as is focusing our attention on those same aspects. Instead, distractor suppression appears to strongly rely on learned, context-dependent expectations. Here, we investigated how learning about upcoming distractors changes distractor processing and directly contrasted the underlying neural dynamics to target learning. We show that, while target learning enhanced anticipatory sensory tuning, distractor learning only modulated reactive suppressive processing. These results suggest that expected distractors may no longer be considered distractors by the brain once it has learned that they can safely be ignored.</p>

<p>There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male LongâEvans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neuroscience literature yet to reach consensus on how the hippocampus supports the organization of events across time in episodic memory. Initial studies reported stable hippocampal maps segmented by remapping events. However, it remains unclear whether segmentation is an artifact of cue responsivity. Recently, research has shown that the hippocampal code exhibits continuous drift. Drift may represent a continually evolving context; however, it is unclear whether this is an artifact of changing experiences. We recorded dCA1 in rats performing an object discrimination task designed to segment time. Overtrained rats could not anticipate upcoming context switches but used context boundaries to their advantage. Hippocampal ensembles showed neither evidence of alternating between stable contexts nor sensitivity to boundaries, but showed robust temporal drift.</p>

<p>A group of vestibular afferent nerve fibers with irregular-firing resting discharges are thought to play a prominent role in responses to fast head movements and vestibular plasticity. We show that, in C57BL/6 mice (either sex, 4â5 weeks old), normal activity in the efferent vestibular pathway is required for function of these irregular afferents. Thermal inhibition of efferent fibers results in a profound inhibition of irregular afferents' resting discharges, rendering them inadequate for signaling head movements. In this way, efferent inputs adjust the contribution of the peripheral irregular afferent pathway that plays a critical role in peripheral vestibular signaling and plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Vestibular end organs in the inner ear receive efferent inputs from the brainstem. Previously, electrical stimulation of efferents was linked to an increase in resting discharges of afferents and a decrease in their sensitivities. Here, we show that localized thermal inhibition of unmyelinated efferents results in a significant decrease in the activity of afferent nerve fibers, particularly those with irregular resting discharges implicated in responses to fast head movements and vestibular compensation. Thus, by upregulating and downregulating of afferent firing, particularly irregular afferents, efferents adjust neural activity sensitive to rapid head movements. These findings support the notion that peripheral vestibular end organs are not passive transducers of head movements and their sensory signal transmission is modulated by efferent inputs.</p>

<p>Receptive fields and tuning curves of sensory neurons represent the neural substrates that allow animals to efficiently detect and distinguish external stimuli. They are progressively refined to create diverse sensitivity and selectivity for neurons along ascending central pathways. However, the neural circuitry mechanisms have not been directly determined for such fundamental qualities in relation to sensory neurons' functional organizations, because of the technical difficulty of correlating neurons' input and output. Here, we obtained spike outputs and synaptic inputs from the same neurons within characteristically defined neural ensembles, to determine the synaptic mechanisms driving their diverse frequency selectivity in the mouse inferior colliculus. We find that the synaptic strength and timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs are configured differently and independently within individual neurons' receptive fields, which segregate sensitive and selective neurons and endow neural populations with broad receptive fields and sharp frequency tuning. By computationally modeling spike outputs from integrating synaptic inputs and comparing them with real spike responses of the same neurons, we show that space-clamping errors did not qualitatively affect the estimation of spike responses derived from synaptic currents in <i>in vivo</i> voltage-clamp recordings. These data suggest that heterogeneous inhibitory circuits coexist locally for a parallel but differentiated representation of incoming signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensitivity and selectivity are functional qualities of sensory systems to facilitate animals' survival. There is little direct evidence for the synaptic basis of neurons' functional variance within neural ensembles. Here we adopted a novel framework to fill such a long-standing gap by uniting population activities with single cells' spike outputs and their synaptic inputs. Furthermore, the effects of space-clamping errors on subcortical synaptic currents were evaluated <i>in vivo</i>, by comparing recorded spike responses and simulated spike outputs from computationally integrating synaptic inputs. Our study illustrated that the synaptic strength and timing of inhibition relative to excitation can be configured differently for neurons within a defined neural ensemble, to segregate their selectivity. It provides new insights into coexisting heterogeneous local circuits.</p>

<p>The ability of neural networks to associate successive states of network activity lies at the basis of many cognitive functions. Hence, we hypothesized that many ubiquitous structural and dynamical properties of local cortical networks result from associative learning. To test this hypothesis, we trained recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on memories composed of varying numbers of associations and compared the resulting network properties with those observed experimentally. We show that, when the network is robustly loaded with near-maximum amount of associations it can support, it develops properties that are consistent with the observed probabilities of excitatory and inhibitory connections, shapes of connection weight distributions, overexpression of specific 2- and 3-neuron motifs, distributions of connection numbers in clusters of 3â8 neurons, sustained, irregular, and asynchronous firing activity, and balance of excitation and inhibition. In addition, memories loaded into the network can be retrieved, even in the presence of noise that is comparable with the baseline variations in the postsynaptic potential. The confluence of these results suggests that many structural and dynamical properties of local cortical networks are simply a byproduct of associative learning. We predict that overexpression of excitatoryâexcitatory bidirectional connections observed in many cortical systems must be accompanied with underexpression of bidirectionally connected inhibitoryâexcitatory neuron pairs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many structural and dynamical properties of local cortical networks are ubiquitously present across areas and species. Because synaptic connectivity is shaped by experience, we wondered whether continual learning, rather than genetic control, is responsible for producing such features. To answer this question, we developed a biologically constrained recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons capable of learning predefined sequences of network states. Embedding such associative memories into the network revealed that, when individual neurons are robustly loaded with a near-maximum amount of memories they can support, the network develops many properties that are consistent with experimental observations. Our findings suggest that basic structural and dynamical properties of local networks in the brain are simply a byproduct of learning and memory storage.</p>

<p>Speech intelligibility can vary dramatically between individuals with similar clinically defined severity of hearing loss based on the audiogram. These perceptual differences, despite equal audiometric-threshold elevation, are often assumed to reflect central-processing variations. Here, we compared peripheral-processing in auditory nerve (AN) fibers of male chinchillas between two prevalent hearing loss etiologies: metabolic hearing loss (MHL) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). MHL results from age-related reduction of the endocochlear potential due to atrophy of the stria vascularis. MHL in the present study was induced using furosemide, which provides a validated model of age-related MHL in young animals by reversibly inhibiting the endocochlear potential. Effects of MHL on peripheral processing were assessed using Wienerâkernel (system identification) analyses of single AN fiber responses to broadband noise, for direct comparison to previously published AN responses from animals with NIHL. Wienerâkernel analyses show that even mild NIHL causes grossly abnormal coding of low-frequency stimulus components. In contrast, for MHL the same abnormal coding was only observed with moderate to severe loss. For equal sensitivity loss, coding impairment was substantially less severe with MHL than with NIHL, probably due to greater preservation of the tip-to-tail ratio of cochlear frequency tuning with MHL compared with NIHL rather than different intrinsic AN properties. Differences in peripheral neural coding between these two pathologiesâthe more severe of which, NIHL, is preventableâlikely contribute to individual speech perception differences. Our results underscore the need to minimize noise overexposure and for strategies to personalize diagnosis and treatment for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Differences in speech perception ability between individuals with similar clinically defined severity of hearing loss are often assumed to reflect central neural-processing differences. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that peripheral neural processing of complex sounds differs dramatically between the two most common etiologies of hearing loss. Greater processing impairment with noise-induced compared with an age-related (metabolic) hearing loss etiology may explain heightened speech perception difficulties in people overexposed to loud environments. These results highlight the need for public policies to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, an entirely avoidable hearing loss etiology, and for personalized strategies to diagnose and treat sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

<p>Inhibition in neuronal networks of the neocortex serves a multitude of functions, such as balancing excitation and structuring neuronal activity in space and time. Plasticity of inhibition is mediated by changes at both inhibitory synapses, as well as excitatory synapses on inhibitory neurons. Using slices from visual cortex of young male rats, we describe a novel form of plasticity of excitatory synapses on inhibitory neurons, weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity. Recordings from connected pyramid-to-interneuron pairs confirm that postsynaptic activity alone can induce long-term changes at synapses that were not presynaptically active during the induction, i.e., heterosynaptic plasticity. Moreover, heterosynaptic changes can accompany homosynaptic plasticity induced in inhibitory neurons by conventional spike-timing-dependent plasticity protocols. In both fast-spiking (FS) and non-FS neurons, heterosynaptic changes were weight-dependent, because they correlated with initial paired-pulse ratio (PPR), indicative of initial strength of a synapse. Synapses with initially high PPR, indicative of low release probability ("weak" synapses), had the tendency to be potentiated, while synapses with low initial PPR ("strong" synapses) tended to depress or did not change. Interestingly, the net outcome of heterosynaptic changes was different in FS and non-FS neurons. FS neurons expressed balanced changes, with gross average (<i>n</i> = 142) not different from control. Non-FS neurons (<i>n</i> = 66) exhibited net potentiation. This difference could be because of higher initial PPR in the non-FS neurons. We propose that weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity may counteract runaway dynamics of excitatory inputs imposed by Hebbian-type learning rules and contribute to fine-tuning of distinct aspects of inhibitory function mediated by FS and non-FS neurons in neocortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition is fundamental for operation of neuronal networks. Fine-tuning of such balance requires synaptic plasticity. Knowledge about diverse forms of plasticity operating in excitatory and inhibitory neurons is necessary for understanding normal function and causes of dysfunction of the nervous system. Here we show that excitatory inputs to major archetypal classes of neocortical inhibitory neurons, fast-spiking (FS) and non-fast-spiking (non-FS), express a novel type of plasticity, weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity, which accompanies the induction of Hebbian-type changes. This novel form of plasticity may counteract runaway dynamics at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons imposed by Hebbian-type learning rules and contribute to fine-tuning of diverse aspects of inhibitory function mediated by FS and non-FS neurons in neocortical networks.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) remains a pressing clinical problem; however, our understanding of sexual dimorphism in CIPN remains unclear. Emerging studies indicate a sex-dimorphic role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in driving neuropathic pain. In this study, we examined the role of TLR9 in CIPN induced by paclitaxel in WT and <i>Tlr9</i> mutant mice of both sexes. Baseline pain sensitivity was not affected in either <i>Tlr9</i> mutant male or female mice. Intraplantar and intrathecal injection of the TLR9 agonist ODN 1826 induced mechanical allodynia in both sexes of WT and <i>Tlr4</i> KO mice but failed to do so in <i>Tlr9</i> mutant mice. Moreover, <i>Trpv1</i> KO or C-fiber blockade by resiniferatoxin failed to affect intraplantar ODN 1826-induced mechanical allodynia. Interestingly, the development of paclitaxel-evoked mechanical allodynia was attenuated by TLR9 antagonism or <i>Tlr9</i> mutation only in male mice. Paclitaxel-induced CIPN caused macrophage infiltration to DRGs in both sexes, and this infiltration was not affected by <i>Tlr9</i> mutation. Paclitaxel treatment also upregulated TNF and CXCL1 in macrophage cultures and DRG tissues in both sexes, but these changes were compromised by <i>Tlr9</i> mutation in male animals. Intraplantar adoptive transfer of paclitaxel-activated macrophages evoked mechanical allodynia in both sexes, which was compromised by <i>Tlr9</i> mutation or by treatment with TLR9 inhibitor only in male animals. Finally, TLR9 antagonism reduced paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia in female nude mice (T-cell and B-cell deficient). Together, these findings reveal sex-dimorphic macrophage TLR9 signaling in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major side effect in cancer patients undergoing clinical chemotherapy treatment regimens. The role of sex dimorphism with regards to the mechanisms of CIPN and analgesia against CIPN remains unclear. Previous studies have found that the infiltration of immune cells, such as macrophages into DRGs and their subsequent activation promote CIPN. Interestingly, the contribution of microglia to CIPN appears to be limited. Here, we show that macrophage TLR9 signaling promotes CIPN in male mice only. This study suggests that pathways in macrophages may be sex-dimorphic in CIPN. Our findings provide new insights into the role of macrophage signaling mechanisms underlying sex dimorphism in CIPN, which may inspire the development of more precise and effective therapies.</p>

<p>Nociceptors located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and DRG are the primary sensors of damaging or potentially damaging stimuli for the head and body, respectively, and are key drivers of chronic pain states. While nociceptors in these two tissues show a high degree of functional similarity, there are important differences in their development lineages, their functional connections to the CNS, and recent genome-wide analyses of gene expression suggest that they possess some unique genomic signatures. Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification to comprehensively characterize and compare mRNA translation in <i>Scn10a</i>-positive nociceptors in the TG and DRG of male and female mice. This unbiased method independently confirms several findings of differences between TG and DRG nociceptors described in the literature but also suggests preferential utilization of key signaling pathways. Most prominently, we provide evidence that translational efficiency in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related genes is higher in the TG compared with DRG, whereas several genes associated with the negative regulator of mTOR, AMP-activated protein kinase, have higher translational efficiency in DRG nociceptors. Using capsaicin as a sensitizing stimulus, we show that behavioral responses are greater in the TG region and this effect is completely reversible with mTOR inhibition. These findings have implications for the relative capacity of these nociceptors to be sensitized upon injury. Together, our data provide a comprehensive, comparative view of transcriptome and translatome activity in TG and DRG nociceptors that enhances our understanding of nociceptor biology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The DRG and trigeminal ganglion (TG) provide sensory information from the body and head, respectively. Nociceptors in these tissues are critical first neurons in the pain pathway. Injury to peripheral neurons in these tissues can cause chronic pain. Interestingly, clinical and preclinical findings support the conclusion that injury to TG neurons is more likely to cause chronic pain and chronic pain in the TG area is more intense and more difficult to treat. We used translating ribosome affinity purification technology to gain new insight into potential differences in the translatomes of DRG and TG neurons. Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized differences between TG and DRG nociceptors that provide new insight into how injury may differentially drive plasticity states in nociceptors in these two tissues.</p>

<p>Normal brain function requires proper targeting of synaptic-vesicle (SV) and active-zone components for presynaptic assembly and function. Whether and how synaptogenic signals (e.g., adhesion) at axo-dendritic contact sites promote axonal transport of presynaptic components for synapse formation, however, remain unclear. In this study, we show that Borderless (Bdl), a member of the conserved IgSF9-family trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, plays a novel and specific role in regulating axonal transport of SV components. Loss of <i>bdl</i> disrupts axonal transport of SV components in photoreceptor R8 axons, but does not affect the transport of mitochondria. Genetic mosaic analysis, transgene rescue and cell-type-specific knockdown indicate that Bdl is required both presynaptically and postsynaptically for delivering SV components in R8 axons. Consistent with a role for Bdl in R8 axons, loss of <i>bdl</i> causes a failure of R8-dependent phototaxis response to green light. <i>bdl</i> interacts genetically with <i>imac</i> encoding for a member of the UNC-104/Imac/KIF1A-family motor proteins, and is required for proper localization of Imac in R8 presynaptic terminals. Our results support a model in which Bdl mediates specific axo-dendritic interactions in a homophilic manner, which upregulates the Imac motor in promoting axonal transport of SV components for R8 presynaptic assembly and function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whether and how synaptogenic adhesion at axo-dendritic contact sites regulates axonal transport of presynaptic components remain unknown. Here we show for the first time that a trans-synaptic adhesion molecule mediates specific interactions at axo-dendritic contact sites, which is required for upregulating the UNC-104/Imac/KIF1A motor in promoting axonal transport of synaptic-vesicle components for presynaptic assembly and function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Extensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing and the phageâdisplay assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established postâmortem.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Using VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies were detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but postâmortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, <i>in situ</i> hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months anteâmortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immunoprofiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wildâtype dengue virus in the central nervous system.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Dengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually selfâlimiting and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Further, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiologies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CLN3 disease is the commonest of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, a group of pediatric neurodegenerative disorders. Functions of the CLN3 protein include antiapoptotic properties and facilitating anterograde transport of galactosylceramide from Golgi to lipid rafts. This study confirms the beneficial effects of longâterm exogenous galactosylceramide supplementation on longevity, neurobehavioral parameters, neuronal cell counts, astrogliosis, and diminution in brain and serum ceramide levels in <i>Cln3</i>
<sup>
   <i>Îex7/8</i>
</sup> knockâin mice. Additionally, the impact of galactosylceramide on ceramide synthesis enzymes is documented.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A group of 72 mice received galactosylceramide or vehicle for 40âweeks. The effect of galactosylceramide supplementation on <i>Cln3</i>
<sup>
   <i>Îex7/8</i>
</sup> mice was determined by performing behavioral tests, measuring ceramide in brains and serum, and assessing impact on longevity, subunit C storage, astrogliosis, and neuronal cell counts.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Galactosylceramide resulted in enhanced grip strength of forelimbs in male and female mice, better balance on the accelerating rotarod in females, and improved motor coordination during pole climbing in male mice. Brain and serum ceramide levels as well as apoptosis rates were lower in galactosylceramideâtreated <i>Cln3</i>
<sup>
   <i>Îex7/8</i>
</sup> mice. Galactosylceramide also increased neuronal cell counts significantly in male and female mice and tended to decrease subunit C storage in specific brain regions. Astrogliosis dropped in females compared to a slight increase in males after galactosylceramide. Galactosylceramide increased the lifespan of affected mice.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Galactosylceramide improved behavioral, neuropathological, and biochemical parameters in <i>Cln3</i>
<sup>
   <i>Îex7/8</i>
</sup> mice, paving the way for effective therapy for CLN3 disease and use of serum ceramide as a potential biomarker to track impact of therapies. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>European Law now requires AI to be explainable in the context of adverse
decisions affecting European Union (EU) citizens. At the same time, it is
expected that there will be increasing instances of AI failure as it operates
on imperfect data. This paper puts forward a neurally-inspired framework called
decision stacks that can provide for a way forward in research aimed at
developing explainable AI. Leveraging findings from memory systems in
biological brains, the decision stack framework operationalizes the definition
of explainability and then proposes a test that can potentially reveal how a
given AI decision came to its conclusion.

<p>Deep learning has sparked a network of mutual interactions between different
disciplines and AI. Naturally, each discipline focuses and interprets the
workings of deep learning in different ways. This diversity of perspectives on
deep learning, from neuroscience to statistical physics, is a rich source of
inspiration that fuels novel developments in the theory and applications of
machine learning. In this perspective, we collect and synthesize different
intuitions scattered across several communities as for how deep learning works.
In particular, we will briefly discuss the different perspectives that
disciplines across mathematics, physics, computation, and neuroscience take on
how deep learning does its tricks. Our discussion on each perspective is
necessarily shallow due to the multiple views that had to be covered. The
deepness in this case should come from putting all these faces of deep learning
together in the reader's mind, so that one can look at the same problem from
different angles.

<p>We provide here a mathematical model of size/context illusions, inspired by
the functional architecture of the visual cortex. We first recall previous
models of scale and orientation, in particular the one in (Sarti et al., 2008),
and simplify it, only considering the feature of scale. Then we recall the
deformation model of illusion, introduced by (Franceschiello et al. 2017), to
describe orientation related GOIs, and adapt it to size illusions. We finally
apply the model to the Ebbinghaus and Delboeuf illusions, validating the
results by comparing with experimental data from (Massaro et al., 1971) and
(Roberts et al., 2005).

<p>Many studies have shown that the excitation and inhibition received by
cortical neurons remain roughly balanced across many conditions. A key question
for understanding the dynamical regime of cortex is the nature of this
balancing. Theorists have shown that network dynamics can yield systematic
cancellation of most of a neuron's excitatory input by inhibition. We review a
wide range of evidence pointing to this cancellation occurring in a regime in
which the balance is loose, meaning that the net input remaining after
cancellation of excitation and inhibition is comparable in size to the factors
that cancel, rather than tight, meaning that the net input is very small
relative to the cancelling factors. This choice of regime has important
implications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance,
but not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in
sensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and
yield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as
observed across multiple cortical areas.

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels carry a non-selective cationic conductance, Ih, which is important for modulating neuron excitability. Four genes (HCN1-4) encode HCN channels, with each gene having  distinct expression and biophysical profiles. Here we use multiplex nucleic acid in situ hybridization to determine HCN4 mRNA expression within the adult mouse brain. We take advantage of this approach to detect HCN4 mRNA simultaneously with either HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA and markers of excitatory (VGlut-positive) and inhibitory (VGat-positive) neurons, which was not previously reported. We have developed a Fiji-based analysis code that enables quantification of mRNA expression within identified cell bodies. The highest HCN4 mRNA expression was found in the habenula (medial and lateral) and the thalamus. HCN4 mRNA was particularly high in the medial habenula with essentially no co-expression of HCN1 or HCN2 mRNA. An absence of Ih-mediated âsagâ in neurons recorded from the medial habenula of knockout mice confirmed that HCN4 channels are the predominant subtype in this region. Analysis in the thalamus revealed HCN4 mRNA in VGlut2-positive excitatory neurons that was always co-expressed with HCN2 mRNA. In contrast, HCN4 mRNA was undetectable in the nucleus reticularis. HCN4 mRNA expression was high in a subset of VGat-positive cells in the globus pallidus external. The majority of these neurons co-expressed HCN2 mRNA while a smaller subset also co-expressed HCN1 mRNA. In the striatum, a small subset of large cells which are likely to be giant cholinergic interneurons co-expressed high levels of HCN4 and HCN2 mRNA. The amygdala, cortex and hippocampus expressed low levels of HCN4 mRNA. This study highlights the heterogeneity of HCN4 mRNA expression in the brain and provides a morphological framework on which to better investigate the functional roles of HCN4 channels.

Neuronal gap junctions formed by connexin36 (Cx36) and chemical synapses share striking similarities in terms of plasticity. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an enzyme known to induce memory formation at chemical synapses, has recently been described to potentiate electrical coupling in the retina and several other brain areas via phosphorylation of Cx36. The contribution of individual CaMKII isoforms to this process, however, remains unknown. We recently identified CaMKII-Î² at electrical synapses in the mouse retina. Now, we set out to identify cell types containing Cx36 gap junctions that also express CaMKII-Î². To ensure precise description, we first tested the specificity of two commercially available antibodies on CaMKII-Î²-deficient retinas. We found that a polyclonal antibody was highly specific for CaMKII-Î². However, a monoclonal antibody (CB-Î²-1) recognized CaMKII-Î² but also cross-reacted with the C-terminal tail of Cx36, making localization analyses with this antibody inaccurate. Using the polyclonal antibody, we identified strong CaMKII-Î² expression in bipolar cell terminals that were secretagogin- and HCN1-positive and thus represent terminals of type 5 bipolar cells. In these terminals, a small fraction of CaMKII-Î² also colocalized with Cx36. A similar pattern was observed in putative type 6 bipolar cells although there, CaMKII expression seemed less pronounced. Next, we tested whether CaMKII-Î² influenced the Cx36 expression in bipolar cell terminals by quantifying the number and size of Cx36-immunoreactive puncta in CaMKII-Î²-deficient retinas. However, we found no significant differences between the genotypes, indicating that CaMKII-Î² is not necessary for the formation and maintenance of Cx36-containing gap junctions in the retina. In addition, in wild-type retinas, we observed frequent association of Cx36 and CaMKII-ï¢ with synaptic ribbons, i.e., chemical synapses, in bipolar cell terminals. This arrangement resembled the composition of mixed synapses found for example in Mauthner cells, in which electrical coupling is regulated by glutamatergic activity. Taken together, our data implies that CaMKII-Î² may fulfill several functions in bipolar cell terminals, regulating both Cx36-containing gap junctions and ribbon synapses and potentially also mediating cross-talk between these two types of bipolar cell outputs.

Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, have been proposed to play an influential role in the cell-to-cell spread of neurodegenerative diseases, including the intercellular transmission of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). However, the regulation of EV biogenesis and its relation to Parkinsonâs disease (PD) is only partially understood. The generation of EVs through the ESCRT-independent pathway depends on the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) to produce ceramide, which causes the membrane of endosomal multivesicular bodies to bud inwards. nSMase2 is sensitive to oxidative stress, a common process in PD brains; however, little is known about the role of sphingomyelin metabolism in the pathogenesis of PD. This is the first study to show that inhibiting nSMase2 decreases the transfer of oligomeric aggregates of Î±-syn between neuron-like cells. Furthermore, it reduced the accumulation and aggregation of high molecular weight Î±-syn. Hypoxia, as a model of oxidative stress, reduced the levels of nSMase2, but not its enzymatic activity, and significantly altered the lipid composition of cells without affecting EV abundance or the transfer of Î±-syn. These data show that altering sphingolipids can mitigate the spread of Î±-syn, even under hypoxic conditions, potentially suppressing PD progression.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00046">Modeling Interval Timing by Recurrent Neural Nets</a></h4>

We studied how recurrent neural nets (RNN), which utilize delayed feedback weights, could model the encoding of time at the supra-second level. Recurrent âGoâ and âNo-Goâ neural processing units with different dynamics were identified whose outputs were summated to generate a pulse that drives a fixed integrator unit.  This system was used to model empirical data from rodents performing in an instrumental âpeak interval timingâ task for Tone and Flash inputs. Reward availability was signaled after different times from stimulus onset during training. Rodent performance was assessed on non-rewarded trials, following training, with each stimulus tested individually and simultaneously in a stimulus compound. The weights in the Go/No-Go network were trained using experimentally obtained mean distribution of bar press rates across an 80 s period. The rewards for tone and flash were given 5 s and 30 s from stimulus onset, respectively. Different Go/No-Go systems were used for each stimulus, but the weighted output of each fed into a final common recurrent integrator unit, whose weights were unmodifiable. The RNN was implemented and trained in Matlab using the data from non-rewarded trials. The neural net output accurately fit the temporal distribution of tone and flash-initiated bar press data. A âTemporal Averagingâ effect was obtained when the flash and tone stimuli were combined. Average auto-correlation functions for the tone, flash and compound responses and cross-correlations between their pairwise combinations confirmed that the peaks and variances of the three response functions significantly differed, with the compound being intermediate between tone and flash but somewhat more similar to flash than tone. Combining tone and flash responses were not superposed as in a linear system. Rather, implementation of nonlinear âsaliency functionsâ that limited the output signal of each stimulus to the final integrator when the other was co-present better fit the data. The model suggests that the brain encodes timing through connection weights of a dynamic RNN. Thus, event timing is coded similar to the way other sensory-motor systems, such as the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic systems combine sensory inputs from the vestibular and visual systems to generate the temporal aspects of compensatory eye movements.

Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a 2-4 fold increased risk for developing Alzheimerâs disease (AD), however the exact mechanisms linking the two disease is unknown. In both conditions, the majority of pathophysiological changes, including glucose and insulin dysregulation, insulin resistance, and AD-related changes in AÎ² and tau, occur decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between metabolic biomarkers associated with T2D and amyloid pathology, including AÎ² levels, from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fasting plasma of healthy, pre-diabetic (PreD), and T2D vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus). Consistent with the human disease, T2D monkeys have increased plasma and CSF glucose levels as they transition from normoglycemia to pre-diabetic and diabetic states. Although plasma levels of acylcarnitines and amino acids remained largely unchanged, peripheral hyperglycemia correlated with decreased CSF acylcarnitines and CSF amino acids, including branched chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations, suggesting profound changes in cerebral metabolism coincident with systemic glucose dysregulation. Moreover, CSF AÎ²40 and CSF AÎ²42 levels decreased in T2D monkeys, a phenomenon observed in the human course of AD which coincides with increased amyloid deposition within the brain. In agreement with previous studies in mice, CSF AÎ²40 and CSF AÎ²42 were highly correlated with CSF glucose levels, suggesting that glucose levels in the brain are associated with changes in AÎ² metabolism. Interestingly, CSF AÎ²40 and CSF AÎ²42 levels were also highly correlated with plasma but not CSF lactate levels, suggesting that plasma lactate might serve as a potential biomarker of disease progression in AD.  Moreover, CSF glucose and plasma lactate levels were correlated with CSF amino acid and acylcarnitine levels, demonstrating alterations in cerebral metabolism occurring with the onset of T2D. Together, these data suggest that peripheral metabolic changes associated with the development of T2D produce alterations in brain metabolism that lead to early changes in the amyloid cascade, similar to those observed in pre-symptomatic AD.

Quantifying, controlling, and monitoring image quality is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the validity and reproducibility of many types of neuroimaging data analyses. Implementation of quality control (QC) procedures is the key to ensuring that neuroimaging data are of high-quality and their validity in the subsequent analyses. We introduce the QC system of the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI): a web-based system featuring a workflow for the assessment of various modality and contrast brain imaging data. The design allows users to anonymously upload imaging data to the LONI-QC system. It then computes an exhaustive set of QC metrics which aids users to perform a standardized QC by generating a range of scalar and vector statistics. These procedures are performed in parallel using a large compute cluster. Finally, the system offers an automated QC procedure for structural MRI, which can flag each QC metric as being âgoodâ or âbadâ. Validation using various sets of data acquired from a single scanner and from multiple sites demonstrated the reproducibility of our QC metrics, and the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed Auto QC to âbadâ quality images in comparison to visual inspection.  To the best of our knowledge, LONI-QC is the first online QC system that uniquely supports the variety of functionality where we compute numerous QC metrics and perform visual/automated image QC of multi-contrast and multi-modal brain imaging data. The LONI-QC system has been used to assess the quality of large neuroimaging datasets acquired as part of various multi-site studies such as the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Study and the Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). LONI-QCâs functionality is freely available to users worldwide and its adoption by imaging researchers is likely to contribute substantially to upholding high standards of brain image data quality and to implementing these standards across the neuroimaging community.

Head direction has been identified to anticipate trajectory direction during human locomotion. Head anticipation has also been shown to persist in darkness. Arguably, the purpose for this anticipatory behaviour is related to motor control and trajectory planning, independently of the visual condition. This implies that anticipation remains in the absence of visual input. However, experiments so far have only explored this phenomenon with visual instructions which intrinsically primes a visual representation to follow. The primary objective of this study is to describe head anticipation in auditory instructed locomotion, in the presence and absence of visual input. Auditory instructed locomotion trajectories were performed in two visual conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. First, ten sighted participants localized static sound sources to ensure they could understand the sound cues provided. Afterwards, they listened to a moving sound source while actively following it. Later, participants were asked to reproduce the trajectory of the moving sound source without sound. Anticipatory head behavior was observed during trajectory reproduction in both eyes open and closed conditions. The results suggest that head anticipation is related to motor anticipation rather than mental simulation of the trajectory.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00291">Downstream Behavioral and Electrophysiological Consequences of Word Prediction on Recognition Memory</a></h4>

When people process language, they can use context to predict upcoming information, influencing processing and comprehension as seen in both behavioral and neural measures. Although numerous studies have shown immediate facilitative effects of confirmed predictions, the downstream consequences of prediction have been less explored. In the current study, we examined those consequences by probing participantsâ recognition memory for words after they read sets of sentences. Participants read strongly and weakly constraining sentences with expected or unexpected endings (âI added my name to the list/basketâ), and later were tested on their memory for the sentence endings while EEG was recorded. Critically, the memory test contained words that were predictable (âlistâ) but were never read (participants saw âbasketâ). Behaviorally, participants showed successful discrimination between old and new items, but false alarmed to the expected-item lures more often than to new items, showing that predicted words or concepts can linger, even when predictions are disconfirmed. Although false alarm rates did not differ by constraint, ERPs differed between false alarms to strongly and weakly predictable words. Additionally, previously unexpected (compared to previously expected) endings that appeared on the memory test elicited larger N1 and LPC amplitudes, suggesting greater attention and episodic recollection. In contrast, highly predictable sentence endings that had been read elicited reduced LPC amplitudes during the memory test. Thus, prediction can facilitate processing in the moment, but can also lead to false memory and reduced recollection for predictable information.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00286">Brain Activity Associated With Expected Task Difficulty</a></h4>

Previous research shows that people are able to use a cue to mentally prepare for a cognitive challenge. The response to a cue has been defined as phasic alertness which is reflected in faster responses and increased activity in frontal, parietal, thalamic, and visual brain regions. We examine if and how phasic alertness can be tuned to the expected difficulty of an upcoming challenge. If people in general are able to tune their level of alertness, than an inability to tune may be linked to disease.
Twenty-two healthy volunteers performed a cued visual perception task with two levels of task difficulty. Performance and brain activity were compared between these two levels.
Performance was lower for difficult stimuli than for easy stimuli. Participants showed activation in a network associated with central executive function and deactivation in regions of the default mode network, and visual cortex for both cue types. Deactivation was significantly stronger for cues signaling difficult stimuli than for cues signaling easy stimuli. This effect was most prominent in medial prefrontal gyrus, visual, and temporal cortices. Activation did not differ between the cues.
Our study shows that phasic alertness is represented by activated as well as deactivated brain regions. However only deactivated brain regions tuned their level of activity to the expected task difficulty. These results suggest that people in general are able to tune their level of alertness to an upcoming task. Cognition may be facilitated by a brain-state coupled to expectations about an upcoming cognitive challenge. Unique identifier = 842003004 .

The assembly of uniquely organized sound localization circuits in the brainstem requires precise developmental mechanisms. Glial cells have been shown to shape synaptic connections in the retinogeniculate system during development, but their contributions to specialized auditory synapses have not been identified. Here we investigated the role of microglia in auditory brainstem circuit assembly, focusing on the formation and pruning of the calyx of Held in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia were pharmacologically depleted in mice early in development using subcutaneous injections of an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, which is essential for microglia survival. Brainstems were examined prior to and just after hearing onset, at postnatal days (P) 8 and P13, respectively. We found that at P13 there were significantly more polyinnervated MNTB neurons when microglia were depleted, consistent with a defect in pruning. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a mature astrocyte marker that normally appears in the MNTB late in development, was significantly decreased in microglia-depleted mice at P13, suggesting a delay in astrocyte maturation. Our results demonstrate that monoinnervation of MNTB neurons by the calyx of Held is significantly disrupted or delayed in the absence of microglia. This finding may reflect a direct role for microglia in synaptic pruning. A secondary role for microglia may be in the maturation of astrocytes in MNTB. These findings highlight the significant function of glia in pruning during calyx of Held development.

While there are murine and rat choroid plexus epithelial cell cultures, a translationally relevant model for choroid plexus activation and function in primates is still lacking. The rhesus macaque is gold standard for modeling viral infection and activation of CNS, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We have developed a rhesus macaque choroid plexus epithelial cell culture model which we believe to suitable for studies of inflammation associated with viral infection of the CNS. Epithelial morphology and function were assessed using vimentin, phalloidin, the tight junction protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Choroid plexus epithelial cell type was confirmed using immunofluorescence with two proteins highly expressed in the choroid plexus: transthyretin and ï¡-klotho. Finally, barrier properties of the model were monitored using pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-ï¡, the TLR2 agonist PamCys3K, and dexamethasone). We have presented a model of the blood-CSF barrier that will allow study into pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions in the brain, while simultaneously measuring real time changes to epithelial cells.

Aging is consistently reported as the most important independent risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. As life expectancy has significantly increased during last decades, neurodegenerative diseases became one of the most critical public health problem in our society. The most investigated neurodegenerative diseases during aging are Alzheimer disease, Frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson disease. The search for biomarkers has been focused so far on cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Recently, exosomes emerged as novel biological source with increasing interest for age related neurodegenerative disease biomarkers.  
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (30-100 nm in size) released by all cell types which originate from the endosomal compartment. They constitute important vesicles for the release and transfer of multiple (signalling, toxic, and regulatory) molecules among cells. Initially thought to have a function merely in waste disposal, exosomes have been recently recognized as fundamental mediators of intercellular communication. They can move from the site of discharge by diffusion and be retrieved in several body fluids, where they may dynamically reflect pathological changes of cells present in inaccessible sites such as the brain.
Multiple evidence has implicated exosomes in age-associated neurodegenerative processes, which lead to cognitive impairment in later life. Critically, consolidated evidence indicates that pathological protein aggregates, including AÎ², tau, and Î±-synuclein are released from brain cells in association with exosomes. Importantly, exosomes act as vehicles between cells not only of proteins but also of nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA transcripts, miRNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) thus potentially influencing gene expression in target cells. 
In this framework, exosomes could contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underneath neurodegenerative diseases and could represent a promising source of biomarkers.
Despite the involvement of exosomes in age-associated neurodegeneration, the study of exosomes and their genetic cargo in physiological aging and in neurodegenerative diseases is still in its infancy. Here we review the current knowledge on protein and ncRNAs cargo of exosomes in normal aging and in age related neurodegenerative diseases.

The Gami-Chunggan formula (GCF) is a modification of the Chunggan (CG) decoction, which has been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinsonâs disease (PD) in Traditional East Asian Medicine. To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of GCF in chronic PD animal models, we used either a 5-week treatment of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine with probenecid (MPTP/p) or the Î±-synuclein A53T overexpressed PD mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with MPTP, in combination with probenecid, for 5 weeks. GCF was administered simultaneously with MPTP injection for 38 days. The A53T Î±-synuclein overexpressed mice were also fed with GCF for 60 days. Using behavioral readouts and western blot analyses, it was observed that GCF prevents motor dysfunction in the MPTP/p-induced and A53T Î±-synuclein overexpressed mice. Moreover, GCF inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and fibers in the striatum (ST) against MPTP/p challenge. The expression of DJ-1 was increased but that of Î±-synuclein was decreased in the SN of PD-like brains by GCF administration. In vitro experiments also showed that GCF inhibited 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines and that it did so to a greater degree than CG. Furthermore, GCF induced BDNF expression through phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, CREB, and AMPK in the SN of PD-like brains. Therefore, use of the herbal medicine GCF offers a potential remedy for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsonâs disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47566">The adhesion-GPCR BAI1 shapes dendritic arbors via Bcr-mediated RhoA activation causing late growth arrest</a></h4>

Dendritic arbor architecture profoundly impacts neuronal connectivity and function, and aberrant dendritic morphology characterizes neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we identify the adhesion-GPCR BAI1 as an important regulator of dendritic arborization. BAI1 loss from mouse or rat hippocampal neurons causes dendritic hypertrophy, whereas BAI1 overexpression precipitates dendrite retraction. These defects specifically manifest as dendrites transition from growth to stability. BAI1-mediated growth arrest is independent of its Rac1-dependent synaptogenic function. Instead, BAI1 couples to the small GTPase RhoA, driving late RhoA activation in dendrites coincident with growth arrest. BAI1 loss lowers RhoA activation and uncouples it from dendrite dynamics, causing overgrowth. None of BAI1âs known downstream effectors mediates BAI1-dependent growth arrest. Rather, BAI1 associates with the Rho-GTPase regulatory protein Bcr late in development and stimulates its cryptic RhoA-GEF activity, which functions together with its Rac1-GAP activity to terminate arborization. Our results reveal a late-acting signaling pathway mediating a key transition in dendrite development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47033">Surface-to-volume scaling and aspect ratio preservation in rod-shaped bacteria</a></h4>

Rod-shaped bacterial cells can readily adapt their lengths and widths in response to environmental changes. While many recent studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying bacterial cell size control, it remains largely unknown how the coupling between cell length and width results in robust control of rod-like bacterial shapes. In this study we uncover a conserved surface-to-volume scaling relation in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and other rod-shaped bacteria, resulting from the preservation of cell aspect ratio. To explain the mechanistic origin of aspect-ratio control, we propose a quantitative model for the coupling between bacterial cell elongation and the accumulation of an essential division protein, FtsZ. This model reveals a mechanism for why bacterial aspect ratio is independent of cell size and growth conditions, and predicts cell morphological changes in response to nutrient perturbations, antibiotics, MreB or FtsZ depletion, in quantitative agreement with experimental data.

Folate transport is mediated by 3 major pathways, reduced folate carrier (RFC), proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), and folate receptor alpha (FRÎ±/Folr1), known to be regulated by ligand-activated nuclear receptors. Cerebral folate delivery primarily occurs at the choroid plexus through FRÎ± and PCFT;...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/BAI7FtQqclk" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the effect of a decrease in blood pressure (BP) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension (OH) on performance in each domain of cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a crossâsectional and withinâgroup design.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Subjects were individuals without dementia and with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 107 individuals without OH and 94 with OH (DMOH); 95 control participants were also included. BP was assessed in both the supine and standing positions. A detailed neuropsychological assessment was made in each posture for all subjects.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were statistically significant differences between the patients without OH and the DMOH group with regard to some cognitive measures while supine. Standing posture exacerbated and broadened cognitive deficits in the DMOH group for all measures in the different domains of cognition including executive functioning, memory, visuospatial skills, information processing speed, and attention. When groupâspecific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both the patients without OH and the DMOH group showed cognitive changes when transitioning from a supine to a standing, upright position, with the DMOH group exhibiting a wider range of neuropsychological deficits in memory, visuospatial skills, executive function, and sustained attention, as well as significant changes in information processing speed.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data demonstrate that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with OH had transient, postureâmediated cognitive deficits in excess of those found in diabetes mellitus without OH. Understanding the effects of OH on cognition due to autonomic failure is important, particularly as clinical assessments and neuroimaging collect data only in the seated or supine positions.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To establish the effects induced by longâterm, unilateral stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)âpositive interneurons on seizures, interictal spikes, and highâfrequency oscillations (80â500Hz) occurring after pilocarpineâinduced status epilepticus (SE)âa proven model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)âin transgenic mice expressing or not expressing ChR2.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PVâChR2 (n = 6) and PVâCre (n = 6) mice were treated with pilocarpine to induce SE. Three hours after SE onset, unilateral optogenetic stimulation (450nm, 25mW, 20âmillisecond pulses delivered at 8Hz for 30 seconds every 2 minutes) of CA3 PVâpositive interneurons was implemented for 14 continuous days in both groups.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Rates of seizures (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.01), interictal spikes (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.001), and interictal spikes with fast ripples (250â500Hz) (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.001) were lower in PVâChR2 than in PVâCre mice. Ripples (80â200Hz) occurring outside of interictal spikes had higher rates in the PVâChR2 group (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.01), whereas isolated fast ripples had lower rates (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.01). However, seizure probability was higher during optogenetic stimulation in PVâChR2 compared to PVâCre animals (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings show that the unilateral activation of CA3 PVâpositive interneurons exerts antiâictogenic effects associated with decreased rates of interictal spikes and fast ripples in this MTLE model. However, PVâpositive interneuron stimulation can paradoxically trigger seizures in epileptic animals, supporting the notion that Î³âaminobutyric acid type A signaling can also initiate ictogenesis.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fiftyâsix children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of restingâstate magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10âfold crossâvalidation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (<i>p</i> &lt;â0.008).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first multiâinstitutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure costâeffective allocation of health care resources.

<p>Anatomy of the human brain constrains the formation of large-scale functional
networks. Here, given measured brain activity in gray matter, we interpolate
these functional signals into the white matter on a structurally-informed
high-resolution voxel-level brain grid. The interpolated volumes reflect the
underlying anatomical information, revealing white matter structures that
mediate functional signal flow between temporally coherent gray matter regions.
Functional connectivity analyses of the interpolated volumes reveal an enriched
picture of the default mode network (DMN) and its subcomponents, including how
white matter bundles support their formation, thus transcending currently known
spatial patterns that are limited within the gray matter only. These
subcomponents have distinct structure-function patterns, each of which are
differentially recruited during tasks, demonstrating plausible structural
mechanisms for functional switching between task-positive and -negative
components. This work opens new avenues for integration of brain structure and
function and demonstrates how global patterns of activity arise from a
collective interplay of signal propagation along different white matter
pathways.

<p>In the sensation of tones, visions and other stimuli, the "surround
inhibition mechanism" (or "lateral inhibition mechanism") is crucial. The
mechanism enhances the signals of the strongest tone, color and other stimuli,
by reducing and inhibiting the surrounding signals, since the latter signals
are less important. This surround inhibition mechanism is well studied in the
physiology of sensor systems. The neural network with two hidden layers in
addition to input and output layers is constructed; having 60 neurons (units)
in each of the four layers. The label (correct answer) is prepared from an
input signal by applying seven times operations of the "Hartline mechanism",
that is, by sending inhibitory signals from the neighboring neurons and
amplifying all the signals afterwards. The implication obtained by the deep
learning of this neural network is compared with the standard physiological
understanding of the surround inhibition mechanism.

<p>Autism is increasing in prevalence and is a neurodevelopmental disorder
characterised by impairments in communication skills and social behaviour.
Connectomes enable a systems-level representation of the brain with recent
interests in understanding the distributed nature of higher order cognitive
function using modules or subnetworks. By dividing the connectome according to
a central component of the brain critical for its function (it's hub), we
investigate network organisation in autism from hub through to peripheral
subnetworks. We complement this analysis by extracting features of energy
transport computed from heat kernels fitted with increasing time steps. This
heat kernel framework is advantageous as it can capture the energy transported
in all direct and indirect pathways between pair-wise regions over 'time', with
features that have correspondence to small-world properties. We apply our
framework to resting-state functional MRI connectomes from a large, publically
available autism dataset, ABIDE. We show that energy propagating through the
brain over time are different between subnetworks, and that heat kernel
features significantly differ between autism and controls. Furthermore, the hub
was functionally preserved and similar to controls, however, increasing
statistical significance between groups was found in increasingly peripheral
subnetworks. Our results support the increasing opinion of non-hub regions
playing an important role in functional organisation. This work shows that
analysing autism by subnetworks with the heat kernel reflects the atypical
activations in peripheral regions as alterations in energy dispersion and may
provide useful features towards understanding the distributed impact of this
disorder on the functional connectome.

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition impacting
high-level cognitive processing and social behavior. Recognizing the
distributed nature of brain function, neuroscientists are exploiting the
connectome to aid with the characterization of this complex disease. The human
connectome has demonstrated the brain to be a highly organized system with a
centralized core vital for effective function. As such, many have used this
topological principle to not only assess core regions, but have stratified the
remaining graph into subnetworks depending on their relation to the core.
Subnetworks are then utilized to further understand the supporting role of more
peripheral nodes with respects to the overall function in the network. A
recently proposed framework for subnetwork definition is based on the network
dependency index (NDI), a measure of a node's importance based on its
contribution to overall efficiency in the network, and the derived subnetworks,
or Tiers, have been shown to be largely stable across ages in structural
networks. Here, we extend the NDI framework to test its efficacy against a
number experimental conditions. We first not only demonstrated NDI's
feasibility on resting-state functional MRI data, but also its stability
irrespective of the group connectome on which NDI was determined for various
edge thresholds. Secondly, by comparing network theory measures of transitivity
and efficiency, significant group differences were identified in NDI Tiers of
greatest importance. This demonstrates the efficacy of utilizing NDI stratified
subnetworks, which can help to improve our understanding of diseases and how
they affect overall brain connectivity.

<p>Local Hebbian learning is believed to be inferior in performance to
end-to-end training using a backpropagation algorithm. We question this popular
belief by designing a local algorithm that can learn convolutional filters at
scale on large image datasets. These filters combined with patch normalization
and very steep non-linearities result in a good classification accuracy for
shallow networks trained locally, as opposed to end-to-end. The filters learned
by our algorithm contain both orientation selective units and unoriented color
units, resembling the responses of pyramidal neurons located in the cytochrome
oxidase 'interblob' and 'blob' regions in the primary visual cortex of
primates. It is shown that convolutional networks with patch normalization
significantly outperform standard convolutional networks on the task of
recovering the original classes when shadows are superimposed on top of
standard CIFAR-10 images. Patch normalization approximates the retinal
adaptation to the mean light intensity, important for human vision. We also
demonstrate a successful transfer of learned representations between CIFAR-10
and ImageNet 32x32 datasets. All these results taken together hint at the
possibility that local unsupervised training might be a powerful tool for
learning general representations (without specifying the task) directly from
unlabeled data.

<p>There is a ongoing debate whether generic early warning signals for critical
transitions exist that can be applied across diverse systems. The human
epileptic brain is often considered as a prototypical system, given the
devastating and, at times, even life-threatening nature of the extreme event
epileptic seizure. More than three decades of international effort has
successfully identified predictors of imminent seizures. However, the
suitability of typically applied early warning indicators for critical slowing
down, namely variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, for indexing seizure
susceptibility is still controversially discussed. Here, we investigated
long-term, multichannel recordings of brain dynamics from 28 subjects with
epilepsy. Using a surrogate-based evaluation procedure of sensitivity and
specificity of time-resolved estimates of early warning indicators, we found no
evidence for critical slowing down prior to 105 epileptic seizures.

<p>We can potentially make progress on the hard problem of consciousness
(Chalmers, 1995), the seemingly intractable problem of explaining how qualia
arise from certain physical systems, via the mathematically tractable problem
of explaining how objectively unmeasurable aspects (identified with qualia)
could arise from certain physical systems that are otherwise objectively
measurable. In short, it is proposed that qualia may correspond to
non-divergent singularities in the mathematical descriptions of certain aspects
of certain complex physical systems. This proposal may have been foreshadowed
by Srinivasa Ramanujan. It could have significant implications for the
prospects of the experimental verification of consciousness in physical systems
and for the prospects of the generation of artificial consciousness (AC).

Microglial cells which are highly plastic immediately respond to any change in the microenvironment by becoming activated and shifting the phenotype towards neurotoxicity and/or neuroprotection. The polarization of microglia/macrophages after SCI seems to be a dynamic process and can change depending upon the microenvironment, stage, course and severity of a post-traumatic process. To date, effective methods to modulate microglia towards a neuroprotective phenotype in order to stimulate neuroregeneration are actively sought for. In this context, available approaches that can selectively impact the polarization of microglia/macrophages, regulate their synthesis of trophic factors and cytokines/chemokines, their phagocytic function and effects on the course and outcome of SCI are discussed in this review.

The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes central nervous system (CNS) myelination during development and after injury. This is achieved via activation of oligodendrocyte-expressed tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B receptors. However, while administration of BDNF has shown beneficial effects, BDNF itself has a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we compare two TrkB-targeted BDNF-mimetics, the structural-mimetic, tricyclic dimeric peptide-6 (TDP6) and the non-peptide small molecule TrkB agonist LM22A-4 in the cuprizone model of central demyelination in female mice. Both mimetics promoted remyelination, increasing myelin sheath thickness and oligodendrocyte densities after one-week recovery. Importantly, LM22A-4 exerts these effects in an oligodendroglial TrkB-dependent manner. However, analysis of TrkB signaling by LM22A-4 suggests rather than direct activation of TrkB, LM22A-4 exerts its effects via indirect transactivation of Trk receptors. Overall, these studies support the therapeutic strategy to selectively targeting TrkB activation to promote remyelination in the brain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00204">New Insights Into Cholinergic Neuron Diversity</a></h4>

Cholinergic neurons comprise a small population of cells in the striatum but have fundamental roles in fine tuning brain function, and in the aetiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinsonâs disease or schizophrenia. The process of developmental cell specification underlying neuronal identity and function is an area of great current interest. There has been significant progress in identifying the developmental origins, commonalities in molecular markers, and physiological properties of the cholinergic neurons. Currently, we are aware of a number of key factors that promote cholinergic fate during development. However, the extent of cholinergic cell diversity is still largely underestimated. Recent evidence has shown new insight on the biological basis of their specification, indicating that cholinergic neurons may be far more diverse than previously thought. This review highlights the physiological features and the synaptic properties that segregate cholinergic cell subtypes. It provides an accurate picture of the cholinergic cell diversity underlying their organization and function in neuronal networks. This review also discusses current challenges in deciphering the logic of the cholinergic cell heterogeneity that plays a fundamental role in the control of neural processes in health and disease.

The transport of glucose across the cell plasma membrane is vital to most mammalian cells. The GLUT (also called SLC2A) family of transmembrane solute carriers is responsible for this function in vivo. GLUT proteins encompass 14 different isoforms in humans with different cell type-specific expression patterns and activities. Central to glucose utilization and delivery in the brain is the neuronally expressed GLUT3. Recent research has shown an involvement of GLUT3 genetic variation or altered expression in several different brain disorders, including Huntingtonâs and Alzheimerâs diseases. Furthermore, GLUT3 was identified as a potential risk gene for multiple psychiatric disorders. To study the role of GLUT3 in brain function and disease a more detailed knowledge of its expression in model organisms is needed. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has in recent years gained popularity as a model organism for brain research and is now well-established for modeling psychiatric disorders. Here, we have analyzed the sequence of GLUT3 orthologues and identified two paralogues in the zebrafish, slc2a3a and slc2a3b. Interestingly, the Glut3b protein sequence contains a unique stretch of amino acids, which may be important for functional regulation. The slc2a3a transcript is detectable in the central nervous system including distinct cellular populations in telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon at embryonic and larval stages. Conversely, the slc2a3b transcript shows a rather diffuse expression pattern at different embryonic stages and brain regions. Expression of slc2a3a is maintained in the adult brain and is found in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The slc2a3b transcripts are present in overlapping as well as distinct regions compared to slc2a3a. Double in situ hybridizations were used to demonstrate that slc2a3a is expressed by some GABAergic neurons at embryonic stages. This detailed description of zebrafish slc2a3a and slc2a3b expression at developmental and adult stages paves the way for further investigations of normal GLUT3 function and its role in brain disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00190">Mucosal Administration of E-selectin Limits Disability in Models of Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

E-selectin plays an important role in mediating rolling of leukocytes along and thus subsequent extravasation across activated endothelial cells comprising the microvasculature of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), the microvasculature is altered and immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord contributing to damage, demyelination and ultimately disability. While mucosal administration is typically used to effect lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness or tolerance to suspect autoantigens, intranasal administration to E-selectin has previously been shown to protect against CNS inflammatory insults. 
We characterized the potential for mucosal administration of E-selectin to modulate CNS autoimmunity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS.  Intranasally administered E-selectin reduced swelling by as much as 50% in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions compared to ovalbumin-tolerized controls. Intranasal E-selectin delivery prior to disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 reduced disease severity and total disease burden by more than 50% compared to PBS-tolerized animals; this protection was not associated with differences in the magnitude of the autoimmune response. Examination after the onset of disease showed that protection was associated with significant reductions in inflammatory infiltrates throughout the spinal cord. Tolerization to E-selectin did not influence encephalitogenic characteristics of autoreactive T cells such as IFN-gamma or IL-17 production.  Clinical disease was also significantly reduced when E-selectin was first delivered after the onset of clinical symptoms.  Splenic and lymph node populations from E-selectin-tolerized animals showed E-selectin-specific T cell responses and production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. Transfer of enriched CD4+ T cells from E-selectin tolerized mice limited disability in the passive SJL model of relapsing remitting MS. These results suggest a role for influencing E-selectin specific responses to limit neuroinflammation that warrants further characterization for the potential to mitigate neurodegeneration in disorders such as MS.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00041">Comparing the Effects of Rhythm-Based Music Training and Pitch-Based Music Training on Executive Functions in Preschoolers</a></h4>

Previous research has indicated beneficial effects of music training on executive functions in children. However, researchers have not clearly determined which component of music training produces these beneficial effects or whether different components exert different effects on executive functions. In the present study, we examined the impact of rhythm-based music training compared to pitch-based music training and sports training as a control on executive functions in preschoolers. Children aged between 5 and 6 years (N = 76) were randomly assigned to one of the three training groups and received training in small groups 3 times a week for 20 minutes in German kindergartens. Before and after training, children completed tests designed to assess inhibition, set shifting, and visuospatial working memory. Parental education, family income, personality, and IQ served as control variables. We observed a significant training group x time interaction for the measure of inhibition. Children from the rhythm group exhibited significant improvements in inhibition from pre- to posttests (dRM = 0.56), whereas children from the other groups did not. Furthermore, children from the rhythm group significantly differed from the sports control group at posttest (dcorr = 0.82). Concerning the measures of set shifting and visuospatial working memory, the descriptive data revealed similar results; however, we did not observe significant training group x time interactions. Based on our findings, rhythm-based music training specifically enhances inhibition in preschoolers and might affect other executive functions, such as set shifting and visuospatial working memory.

Non-invasive neuromodulatory interventions have the potential to influence neural plasticity and augment motor rehabilitation in people with stroke. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) involves the repeated pairing of single pulses of electrical stimulation to a peripheral nerve and single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral primary motor cortex. The efficacy of PAS in the lower limb of healthy and stroke populations has not been systematically appraised, and optimal protocols, including stimulation parameter settings, have yet to be determined. This systematic review evaluates: a) the efficacy of PAS on lower limb corticomotor excitability in healthy and stroke populations, and b) the stimulation parameters employed. Five databases were searched for randomised, non-randomised, and pre-post experimental studies, that investigated the efficacy of lower limb PAS in healthy and stroke populations. Two independent reviewers identified eligible studies and assessed methodological quality using the modified Downs and Blacks Tool and the TMS Checklist. PAS stimulation parameters and TMS measurement methods were also extracted and compared. Twelve articles, comprising 24 experiments, met the inclusion criteria. Four articles evaluated PAS in people with stroke. Following a single session of PAS, 21 experiments reported modulation of corticomotor excitability, lasting up to 60 minutes; however, the research lacked methodological rigour. Intervention stimulation parameters were highly variable across experiments, and whilst these appeared to influence efficacy, variations in the intervention and outcome assessment methods hindered the ability to draw conclusions about optimal parameters. Lower limb PAS requires further investigation before considering its translation into clinical practice. Eight key recommendations are offered as a guide for enhancing future research in the field.

A certain degree of age-related cognitive decline is normal; however, some people retain more cognitive function than others. Cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to cognitive reserve is crucial, so effective strategies for the prevention of dementia can be developed. Engaging in physical activity can delay cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia and a number of early life conditions have been shown to have long-lasting effects on cognition. This mini-review combines these two observations to evaluate the evidence from both animal models and epidemiological studies for physical activity in early life (â¤ 30 years) delaying cognitive decline in later life (cognition tested â¥ 60 years). 
Three epidemiological studies were found; two showed a positive association and one found none. The latter was deemed to have an unreliable method. 
A review of animal studies found none that analysed the effect of physical activity in early life on cognition in later life. However, in rodent models that analysed mid-life cognition, runners showed improved cognition and enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, changes which were preserved across the life span. 
Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether physical activity in early life may delay cognitive decline in later life, but these results indicate that further studies are warranted. Future human research should be in the form of longitudinal studies that begin below â¤ 15 years and assess sex differences. Crucially, the physical activity data must define type, quantity and intensity of exercise.

Neural reflexes regulate inflammation and electrical activation of the vagus nerve reduces inflammation in several models of inflammatory disease. These discoveries have generated an increasing interest in targeted neurostimulation as specific treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Data from the first clinical trials that use vagus nerve stimulation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ChronÂ´s disease suggest that there is a therapeutic potential of electrical vagus nerve stimulation in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. Accordingly, there is an interest to further explore the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of electrical vagus nerve stimulation experimentally in a range of experimental settings and available genetic mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a simple method for consistent electrical vagus nerve stimulation in the mouse.

Cognitive scientists and philosophers recently have highlighted the value of thinking about people at risk of or living with dementia as intertwined parts of broader cognitive systems that involve their spouse, family, friends or carers. By this view, we rely on people and things around us to âscaffoldâ mental processes such as memory. In this study we identified 39 long-married, older adult couples who are part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing; all were healthy but half were subjective memory complainers. During two visits to their homes one week apart, we assessed husbandsâ and wivesâ cognitive performance across a range of everyday memory tasks working alone (Week 1) versus together (Week 2), including a Friends Task where they provided first and last names of their friends and acquaintances. As reported elsewhere, elderly couples recalled many more friendsâ names working together compared to alone. Couples who remembered successfully together used well developed, rich, sensitive, and dynamic communication strategies to boost each otherâs recall. But, if one or both spouses self-reported mild-to-moderate or significant hearing difficulties (56% of husbands, 31% of wives), they received less benefit from collaboration. Our findings imply that hearing loss may disrupt collaborative support structures that couples (and other intimate communicative partners) hone over decades together. We discuss the possibility that, cut off from the social world that scaffolds them, hearing loss may place older adults at greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00290">Adiposity Related Brain Plasticity Induced by Bariatric Surgery</a></h4>

Previous MRI studies revealed structural-functional brain reorganization twelve months after gastric-bypass surgery, encompassing cortical and subcortical regions of all brain lobes as well as the cerebellum. Changes in the mean of cluster-wise gray/white matter density (GMD/WMD) were correlated with the individual loss of body mass index (BMI), rendering the BMI a potential marker of widespread surgery-induced brain plasticity. Here, we investigated voxel-by-voxel associations between surgery-induced changes in adiposity, metabolism and inflammation and markers of functional and structural neural plasticity. We re-visited the data of patients who underwent functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, six months (n=27) and twelve months after surgery (n=22), and computed voxel-wise regression analyses. Only the surgery-induced weight loss was significantly associated with brain plasticity, and this only for GMD changes. After six months, weight loss overlapped with altered GMD in the hypothalamus, the brainâs homeostatic control site, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, assumed to host reward and gustatory processes, as well as abdominal representations in somatosensory cortex. After twelve months, weight loss scaled with GMD changes in right cerebellar lobule VII, involved in language-related/cognitive processes, and, by trend, with the striatum, assumed to underpin (food) reward. These findings suggest time-dependent and weight-loss related gray matter plasticity in brain regions involved in the control of eating, sensory processing and cognitive functioning.

Reward anticipation is essential for directing behavior towards positively valenced stimuli, creating motivational salience. Task-related activation of the ventral striatum has long been used as a target for understanding reward function. However, some subjects may not be able to perform the respective tasks because of their complexity or subjectsâ physical or mental disabilities. Moreover, task implementations may differ, which results in limited comparability. Hence, developing a task-free method for evaluating neural gain circuits is essential. Research has shown that fluctuations in neuronal activity at rest denoted individual differences in the brain functional networks. Here, we proposed novel models to predict the activation of the ventral striatum during gain anticipation, using the fMRI data of 45 healthy subjects acquired during a monetary incentive delay task and under rest. In-sample validation and held-out data were used to estimate the generalizability of the models. It was possible to predict three measures of reward activation (sensitivity, average, maximum) from resting-state functional connectivity (Pearsonâs r = 0.38 â 0.54 in validation data). Especially high contributions to the models were observed from the default mode network. These findings highlight the potential of using functional connectivity at rest as a task-free alternative for predicting activation in the ventral striatum, offering a possibility to estimate reward response in the broader sampling of subject populations.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00288">Beyond the Low Frequency Fluctuations: Morning and Evening Differences in Human Brain</a></h4>

Human performance, alertness, and most biological functions express rhythmic fluctuations across a 24-hour-period. This phenomenon is believed to originate from differences in both circadian and homeostatic sleep-wake regulatory processes. Interactions between these processes result in time-of-day modulations of behavioral performance as well as brain activity patterns. Although the basic mechanism of the 24-hour clock is conserved across evolution, there are interindividual differences in the timing of sleep-wake cycles, subjective alertness and functioning throughout the day. The study of circadian typology differences has increased during the last few years, especially research on extreme chronotypes, which provide a unique way to investigate the effects of sleep-wake regulation on cerebral mechanisms. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed the influence of chronotype and time-of-day on resting-state functional connectivity. 29 extreme morning- and 34 evening-type participants underwent two fMRI sessions: about one hour after wake-up time (morning) and about ten hours after wake-up time (evening), scheduled according to their declared habitual sleep-wake pattern on a regular working day. Analysis of obtained neuroimaging data disclosed only an effect of time of day on resting-state functional connectivity; there were different patterns of functional connectivity between morning and evening sessions. The results of our study showed no differences between extreme morning-type and evening-type individuals. We demonstrate that circadian and homeostatic influences on the resting-state functional connectivity have a universal character, unaffected by circadian typology.

Although the N400 was originally discovered in a paradigm designed to elicit a P300 (Kutas &amp; Hillyard 1980), its relationship with the P300 and how both overlapping ERPs determine behavioral profiles is still elusive. Here we conducted an ERP (N=20) and a multiple-response SAT (speed-accuracy tradeoff) experiment (N=16) on distinct participant samples using an antonym paradigm (The opposite of black is white/nice/yellow with acceptability judgment). We hypothesized that SAT profiles incorporate processes of task-related decision-making (P300) and stimulus-related expectation violation (N400). We replicated previous ERP results (Roehm et al. 2007): in the correct condition (white), the expected target elicits a P300, while both expectation violations engender an N400 (reduced for related (yellow) vs. unrelated targets (nice)). Using multivariate Bayesian mixed-effects models, we modelled the P300 and N400 responses simultaneously and found that correlation between residuals and subject-level random effects of each response window was minimal, suggesting that the components are largely independent. For the SAT data, we found that antonyms and unrelated targets had a similar slope (rate of increase in accuracy over time) and an asymptote at ceiling, while related targets showed both a lower slope and a lower asymptote, reaching only approximately 80% accuracy. Using a GLMM-based approach (Davidson and Martin, 2013), we modelled these dynamics using response time and condition as predictors. Replacing the predictor for condition with the averaged P300 and N400 amplitudes from the ERP experiment, we achieved identical model performance. We then examined the piecewise contribution of the P300 and N400 amplitudes with partial effects (see Hohenstein &amp; Kliegl 2015). Unsurprisingly, the P300 amplitude was the strongest contributor to the SAT-curve in the antonym condition and the N400 was the strongest contributor in the unrelated condition. In brief, this is the first demonstration of how overlapping ERP responses in one sample of participants predict behavioral SAT profiles of another sample. The P300 and N400 reflect two independent but interacting processes and the competition between these processes is reflected differently in behavioral parameters of speed and accuracy.

Purpose: Predicting patient survival outcome is recognized as key importance to clinicians in oncology toward determining an ideal course of treatment and patient management. This study applies radiomics analysis on pre-operative multi-parametric MRI of patients with glioblastoma from multi-institution to identify a signature and a practical machine learning model for stratifying patients into groups based on overall survival. 
Methods: This study included 163 patientsâ data with glioblastoma, collected by BRATS 2018 Challenge from multiple institutions. In this proposed method, a set of 147 radiomics image features were extracted locally from three tumor sub-regions on standardized pre-operative multi-parametric MR images. LASSO regression was applied for identifying an informative subset of chosen features whereas a Cox model used to obtain the coefficients of those selected features. Then, a radiomics signature model of 9 features was constructed on the discovery set and it performance was evaluated for patients stratification into short- (&lt; 10 months), medium- (10 â 15 months), and long-survivors (&gt; 15 months) groups. Eight ML classification models, trained and then cross-validated, were tested to assess a range of survival prediction performance as a function of the choice of features. 
Results: The proposed mpMRI radiomics signature model had a statistically significant association with survival (P &lt; 0.001) in the training set, but was not confirmed (P = 0.110) in the validation cohort. Its performance in the validation set had a sensitivity of 0.476 (short-), 0.231 (medium-), and 0.600 (long-survivors), and specificity of 0.667 (short-), 0.732 (medium-), and 0.794 (long-survivors). Among the tested ML classifiers, the ensemble learning modelâs results showed superior performance in predicting the survival classes, with an overall accuracy of 57.8 % and AUC of 0.81 for short-, 0.47 for medium-, and 0.72 for long-survivors using the LASSO selected features combined with clinical factors.  
Conclusion: A derived GLCM feature, representing intra-tumoral inhomogeneity, was found to have a high association with survival. Clinical factors, when added to the radiomics image features, boosted the performance of the ML classification model in predicting individual glioblastoma patientâs survival prognosis, which can improve prognostic quality a further step towards precision oncology.

Effective (fast, reliable, and accurate) information propagation through multiple brain regions underlies cognitive processes. However, it remains unclear how neural circuits support the propagation, particularly over a background of irregular firing and response latency. Here, we propose a temporal coding model for the cellular and network mechanisms of the cortical propagation through the anatomical-functional integration across different scales of neural systems via dynamic, probabilistic, and statistical analyses. We hypothesize that synchronous spike events are a cortical population response to high-intensity thalamic input by which a high-density spike train is segregated into many low-density spike trains to avoid the lengthened latency caused by the high-intensity signal, thereby enhancing transfer speed. Moreover, cortical minicolumns prevent repeated activation of synchronous spiking events and facilitate transfer speed by parallel propagation via neurons with a column stereotypically interconnected in the vertical dimension, while columnar segregation avoids information loss in disassembly-parallel propagation. Under the Synchronous Spiking-Cortical Columns hypothesis, effective signal transfer in neural circuits relies on interneuron signal transfer with temporal-complete fidelity. We elicit a single-neuron encoder by modeling the membrane potential in response to stimulation as a resilience system in the nonlinear autoregressive integrated process derived by applying Newton's second law to stochastic resilience systems. A decoder is introduced to correct the response error of the encoder based on all-or-none law and backpropagation. Using the encoder-decoder as a signal propagator in interneurons, simulation studies are conducted where the input spike trains are generated by the right parietal 4 neuron and by a sound wave simulator, respectively. Statistical analysis and and simulations indicate that the encoder--decoder can effectively reproduce intracellular recordings from the right parietal 4 snail neuron and predict that interneuron transfer can achieve temporal-complete fidelity via regulations of ionic homeostasis and all-or-none law/backpropagation. Disfunctions of synchronous spiking and minicolumns may be the proximate cause of epilepsy or cognitive disease.

Highfidelity regulation of information transmission among cerebellar layers is mainly provided by synaptic plasticity. Therefore, determining the regulatory foundations of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and translating them to behavioral output is of great importance. To date, many experimental studies have been carried out in order to clarify the effect of synaptic defects, while targeting a specific signaling pathway in the cerebellar function. However, the contradictory results of these studies at the behavioral level, further add to the ambiguity of the problem. Information transmission through firing rate changes in populations of interconnected neurons is one of the most widely accepted principles of neural coding. In this study, while considering the efficacy of synaptic interactions among the cerebellar layers, we propose a firing rate model to realize the concept of transmission coefficient. Thereafter, using a computational approach, we test the effect of different values of transmission coefficient on the gain adaptation of a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task. In conformity with the behavioral data, the proposed model can accurately predict that disruption in different forms of synaptic plasticity does not have the same effect on motor learning. Specifically, Impairment in training mechanisms, like in the train-induced LTD in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, has a significant negative impact on all aspects of learning, including memory formation, transfer, and consolidation, although it does not disrupt basic motor performance. In this regard, the over-induction of parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron LTP is not able to prevent motor learning impairment, despite its vital role in preserving the robustness of basic motor performance. In contrast, impairment in plasticity induced by interneurons and background activity of climbing fibers is partly compensable through overinduction of train-induced parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD. Additionally, blockade of climbing fiber signaling to cerebellar cortex, referred to as olivary system lesion, shows the most destructive effect on both motor learning and basic motor performance. Overall, the obtained results from the proposed computational framework are used to provide a map from procedural motor memory formation in the cerebellum. Certainly, the generalization of this concept to other multi-layered networks of the brain requires more physiological and computational researches.

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women and diaplazental transmission to the fetus is linked to the congenital syndrome of microcephaly in newborns. This neuropathology is believed to result from significant death of neuronal progenitor cells. Here we examined the fate of neurons in the developing hippocampus, a brain structure which houses neuronal populations of different maturation states. For this purpose, we infected hippocampal slice cultures from immunocompetent newborn mice with ZIKV and monitored changes in hippocampal architecture. In neurons of all hippocampal subfields ZIKV was detected by immunofluorescence labeling and electron microscopy. This includes pyramidal neurons that maturate during the embryonic phase. In the dentate gyrus, ZIKV could be found in the Cajal-Retzius cells which belong to the earliest born cortical neurons, but also in granule cells that are predominantly generated postnatally. Intriguingly, virus particles were also present in the correctly outgrowing mossy fiber axons of juvenile granule cells, suggesting that viral infection does not impair region- and layer-specific formation of this projection. ZIKV infection of hippocampal tissue was accompanied by both a profound astrocyte indicating tissue injury and a microglia response suggesting phagocytotic activity.Furthermore, depending on the viral load and incubation time, we observed extensive overall neuronal loss in the cultured hippocampal slice cultures. Thus, we conclude ZIKV can replicate in various neuronal populations and trigger neuronal death independent of the maturation state of infected cells.

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of human epilepsy and available treatments with antiepileptic drugs are not disease-modifying therapies. The neuroinflammation, neuronal death and exacerbated plasticity that occur during the silent period, following the initial precipitating event (IPE), seem to be crucial for epileptogenesis. Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) such as HMGB-1, are released early during this period concomitantly with a phenomenon of reactive gliosis and neurodegeneration. Here, using a combination of primary neuronal and glial cell cultures, we show that exposure to HMGB-1 induces dendrite loss and neurodegeneration in a glial-dependent manner. In glial cells, loss of function studies showed that HMGB-1 exposure induces NF-kB activation by engaging a signaling pathway that involves TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE. In the absence of glial cells, HMGB-1 failed to induce neurodegeneration of primary cultured cortical neurons. Moreover, purified astrocytes were unable to fully respond to HMGB-1 with NF-kB activation and required microglial cooperation. In agreement, in vivo HMGB-1 blockage with glycyrrhizin, immediately after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, reduced neuronal degeneration, reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the long term. We conclude that microglial-astroglial cooperation is required for astrocytes to respond to HMGB-1 and to induce neurodegeneration. Disruption of this HMGB-1 mediated signaling pathway shows beneficial effects by reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after status epilepticus. Thus, early treatment strategies during the latency period aimed at blocking downstream signaling pathways activated by HMGB-1 are likely to have a significant effect in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that are proposed as key factors in epileptogenesis.

Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been widely used to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there exists no consensus on the best stimulation sites.

Objective: To explore potential stimulation locations for NIBS treatment in patients with MCI, combining meta- and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses. 

Methods: The meta-analysis was conducted to identify brain regions associated with MCI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted based on this meta-analysis. The rsFC analysis was applied to 45 MCI patients to determine brain surface regions that are functionally connected with the above ROIs. 

Results: We found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus were the overlapping brain regions between our results and those of previous studies. In addition, we recommend that the temporoparietal junction (including the angular gyrus), which was found in both the meta- and rsFC analysis, should be considered in NIBS treatment of MCI. Furthermore, the bilateral orbital prefrontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus may be potential brain stimulation sites for NIBS treatment of MCI.

Conclusion: Our results provide several potential sites for NIBS, such as the DLFPC and inferior frontal gyrus, and may shed light on the locations of NIBS sites in the treatment of patients with MCI.

The accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide ï¼hIAPPï¼ in pancreatic islets under induction by a high-fat diet plays a critical role in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is a risk factor of late-onset Alzheimerâs disease (AD). Nevertheless, whether hIAPP in combination with hyperlipidemia may lead to AD-like pathological changes in the brain remains unclear. hIAPP transgenic mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 6 or 12 months to establish the T2DM model. The accumulation of amylin, the numbers of Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)-positive and Î²-gal positive cells, and the deposition level of AÎ²42 in the hippocampi of the transgenic mice were detected by using brain sections. Cytoplasmic and membrane proteins were extracted from the hippocampi of the transgenic mice, and the ratio of membrane GLUT4 expression to cytoplasmic GLUT4 expression was measured through Western blot analysis. Changes in the cognitive functions of hIAPP transgenic mice after 12 months of feeding with a high-fat diet were evaluated. hIAPP transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet for 6 or 12 months showed elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance; increased amylin accumulation, number of FJC-positive and Î²-gal positive cells, and AÎ²42 deposition in the hippocampi; and reduced membrane GLUT4 expression levels. hIAPP transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet for 12 months showed reductions in social cognitive ability and passive learning ability. A high-fat diet increased amylin accumulation in the hippocampi of hIAPP transgenic mice, which presented AD-like pathology and behavior characterized by neural degeneration, brain aging, AÎ²42 deposition, and impaired glucose utilization and cognition.

Parkinsonâs disease (PD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disease with a strong association established with systemic inflammation. Recently, the role of the gingipains protease group from Porphyromonas gingivalis was implicated in Alzheimerâs disease and here we present evidence, using a fluorescent antibody to detect gingipain R1 (RgpA), of itâs presence in a PD population. We confirm previous findings regarding PD systemic inflammation via multiplex cytokine analysis, demonstrate hypercoagulation using thromboelastography (TEG), confocal- and electron microscopy. To further elucidate the action of this gingipain, as well as of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. gingivalis, low concentrations of recombinant RgpA and LPS were added to purified fluorescent fibrinogen. In our PD and control blood analysis, our results show increased hypercoagulation, the presence of amyloid formation in plasma, and profound ultrastructural changes to platelets. Biomarker analysis confirmed significantly increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Our laboratory analysis of purified fibrinogen with added RgpA, and/or LPS, showed preliminary data with regards to the actions of the protease and the bacterial membrane inflammagen on plasma proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00206">Synergistic Effects of Curcumin and Piperine as Potent Acetylcholine and Amyloidogenic Inhibitors With Significant Neuroprotective Activity in SH-SY5Y Cells via Computational Molecular Modeling and in vitro Assay</a></h4>

Hallmarks of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) pathology include acetylcholine deficiency and plaque deposition. Emerging studies suggest that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) may interact with amyloid beta (AÎ²) to promote aggregation of insoluble amyloid beta plaques in brains of patients. Current therapeutic options available for AD patients, such as AChE inhibitors, provide only symptomatic relief. In this study, we screened four natural compounds believed to harbour cognitive benefits- curcumin, piperine, bacoside A and chebulinic acid. In the first section, preliminary screening through computational molecular docking simulations gauged the suitability of the compounds as novel AChE inhibitors. From here, only compounds that met the in silico selection criteria were selected for the second section through in vitro investigations, including AChE enzyme inhibition assay, MTT assay, ThT assay and biochemical analysis via a neuronal cell line model. Of the four compounds screened, only curcumin (-9.6kcal/mol) and piperine (-10.5kcal/mol) showed favorable binding affinities and interactions towards AChE and were hence selected. In vitro AChE inhibition demonstrated that combination of curcumin and piperine showed greater AChE inhibition with an IC50 of 62.81 Â± 0.01Î¼g/mL as compared to individual compounds, i.e., IC50 of curcumin at 134.5 Â± 0.06Âµg/mL and IC50 of piperine at 76.6 Â± 0.08Âµg/mL. In SH-SY5Y cell model, this combination preserved cell viability up to 85%, indicating that the compounds protect against AÎ²-induced neuronal damage (p&lt;0.01). Interestingly, our results also showed that curcumin and piperine achieved a synergistic effect at 35ÂµM with SQ value of 1.824. Synergistic behavior indicates that combination of these two compounds at lower concentrations may provide a better outcome than individually for AÎ² proteins. Combined curcumin and piperine managed to inhibit aggregation (reduced ThT intensity at 0.432a.u) (p&lt;0.01) as well as disaggregation (reduced ThT intensity at 0.532a.u) (p&lt;0.01) of fibrillar AÎ²42. Furthermore, combined curcumin and piperine reversed the AÎ²-induced up-regulation of neuronal oxidative stress (p&lt;0.01). In conclusion, curcumin and piperine demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects whereas bacoside A and chebulinic acid may not be suitable lead compounds. These results are hoped to advance the field of natural products research as potential therapeutic and curative AD agents.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49324">Mapping person-to-person variation in viral mutations that escape polyclonal serum targeting influenza hemagglutinin</a></h4>

A longstanding question is how influenza virus evolves to escape human immunity, which is polyclonal and can target many distinct epitopes. Here, we map how all amino-acid mutations to influenzaâs major surface protein affect viral neutralization by polyclonal human sera. The serum of some individuals is so focused that it selects single mutations that reduce viral neutralization by over an order of magnitude. However, different viral mutations escape the sera of different individuals. This individual-to-individual variation in viral escape mutations is <i>not</i> present among ferrets that have been infected just once with a defined viral strain. Our results show how different single mutations help influenza virus escape the immunity of different members of the human population, a phenomenon that could shape viral evolution and disease susceptibility.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49252">Notch signalling maintains Hedgehog responsiveness via a Gli-dependent mechanism during spinal cord patterning in zebrafish</a></h4>

Spinal cord patterning is orchestrated by multiple cell signalling pathways. Neural progenitors are maintained by Notch signalling, whereas ventral neural fates are specified by Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. However, how dynamic interactions between Notch and Hh signalling drive the precise pattern formation is still unknown. We applied the PHRESH (<span class="underline">PH</span>otoconvertible <span class="underline">RE</span>porter of <span class="underline">S</span>ignalling <span class="underline">H</span>istory) technique to analyse cell signalling dynamics <i>in vivo</i> during zebrafish spinal cord development. This approach reveals that Notch and Hh signalling display similar spatiotemporal kinetics throughout spinal cord patterning. Notch signalling functions upstream to control Hh response of neural progenitor cells. Using gain- and loss-of-function tools, we demonstrate that this regulation occurs not at the level of upstream regulators or primary cilia, but rather at the level of Gli transcription factors. Our results indicate that Notch signalling maintains Hh responsiveness of neural progenitors via a Gli-dependent mechanism in the spinal cord.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49130">Humans can efficiently look for but not select multiple visual objects</a></h4>

The human brain recurrently prioritizes task-relevant over task-irrelevant visual information. A central, question is whether multiple objects can be prioritized simultaneously. To answer this, we let observers search for two colored targets among distractors. Crucially, we independently varied the number of target colors that observers anticipated, and the number of target colors actually used to distinguish the targets in the display. This enabled us to dissociate the preparation of selection mechanisms from the actual engagement of such mechanisms. Multivariate classification of electroencephalographic activity allowed us to track selection of each target separately across time. The results revealed only small neural and behavioral costs associated with preparing for selecting two objects, but substantial costs when engaging in selection. Further analyses suggest this cost is the consequence of neural competition resulting in limited parallel processing, rather than a serial bottleneck. The findings bridge diverging theoretical perspectives on capacity limitations of feature-based attention.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48410">A nuclear role for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 in tRNA export</a></h4>

Dbp5 is an essential DEAD-box protein that mediates nuclear mRNP export. Dbp5 also shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments with reported roles in transcription, ribosomal subunit export, and translation; however, the mechanism(s) by which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs and how Dbp5 specifically contributes to each of these processes remains unclear. Towards understanding the functions and transport of Dbp5 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to generate point mutants at all possible residues within a GFP-Dbp5 reporter. Characterization of the 456 viable mutants led to the identification of an N-terminal Xpo1-dependent nuclear export signal in Dbp5, in addition to other separation-of-function alleles, which together provide evidence that Dbp5 nuclear shuttling is not essential for mRNP export. Rather, disruptions in Dbp5 nucleocytoplasmic transport result in tRNA export defects, including changes in tRNA shuttling dynamics during recovery from nutrient stress.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48224">Adaptive substitutions underlying cardiac glycoside insensitivity in insects exhibit epistasis <i>in vivo</i></a></h4>

Predicting how species will respond to selection pressures requires understanding the factors that constrain their evolution. We use genome engineering of <i>Drosophila </i>to investigate constraints on the repeated evolution of unrelated herbivorous insects to toxic cardiac glycosides, which primarily occurs via a small subset of possible functionally-relevant substitutions to Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Surprisingly, we find that frequently observed adaptive substitutions at two sites, 111 and 122, are lethal when homozygous and adult heterozygotes exhibit dominant neural dysfunction. We identify a phylogenetically correlated substitution, A119S, that partially ameliorates the deleterious effects of substitutions at 111 and 122. Despite contributing little to cardiac glycoside-insensitivity <i>in vitro</i>, A119S, like substitutions at 111 and 122, substantially increases adult survivorship upon cardiac glycoside exposure. Our results demonstrate the importance of epistasis in constraining adaptive paths. Moreover, by revealing distinct effects of substitutions <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i>, our results underscore the importance of evaluating the fitness of adaptive substitutions and their interactions in whole organisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47498">Increased expression of heme-binding protein 1 early in Alzheimer's disease is linked to neurotoxicity</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, understanding AD progression at the molecular level, especially at its early stages, remains elusive. Here, we identified several presymptomatic AD markers by investigating brain proteome changes over the course of neurodegeneration in a transgenic mouse model of AD (3ÃTg-AD). We show that one of these markers, heme-binding protein 1 (Hebp1), is elevated in the brains of both 3ÃTg-AD mice and patients affected by rapidly-progressing forms of AD. Hebp1, predominantly expressed in neurons, interacts with the mitochondrial contact site complex (MICOS) and exhibits a perimitochondrial localization. Strikingly, wildtype, but not Hebp1-deficient, neurons showed elevated cytotoxicity in response to heme-induced apoptosis. Increased survivability in Hebp1-deficient neurons is conferred by blocking the activation of the mitochondrial-associated caspase signaling pathway. Taken together, our data highlight a role of Hebp1 in progressive neuronal loss during AD progression.

Understanding intrinsic and acquired resistance is crucial to overcoming cancer chemotherapy failure. While it is well-established that intratumor, subclonal genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity significantly contribute to resistance, it is not fully understood how tumor sub-clones interact with each other to withstand therapy pressure. Here, we report a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors: cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), in which cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit we engineered phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by conferring mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. By integrating mathematical modeling with flow cytometry, we characterized the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition. Leveraging the flow cytometry data, we estimated the modelâs parameters to reveal that the combination of WT and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values. Finally, we used an <i>ex vivo</i> human tumor model that predicts clinical response through drug sensitivity analyses and determined that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. Together, these findings present a new paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart drug pressure, suggesting that profiling for druggable targets (i.e. mutations) alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7o_kagLkuJs" width="1" />

<p>by Maxim Komarov, Paola Malerba, Ryan Golden, Paul Nunez, Eric Halgren, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Despite its critical importance in experimental and clinical neuroscience, at present there is no systematic method to predict which neural elements will be activated by a given stimulation regime. Here we develop a novel approach to model the effect of cortical stimulation on spiking probability of neurons in a volume of tissue, by applying an analytical estimate of stimulation-induced activation of different cell types across cortical layers. We utilize the morphology and properties of axonal arborization profiles obtained from publicly available anatomical reconstructions of the twelve main categories of neocortical neurons to derive the dependence of activation probability on cell type, layer and distance from the source. We then propagate this activity through the local network incorporating connectivity, synaptic and cellular properties. Our work predicts that (a) intracranial cortical stimulation induces selective activation across cell types and layers; (b) superficial anodal stimulation is more effective than cathodal at cell activation; (c) cortical surface stimulation focally activates layer I axons, and (d) there is an optimal stimulation intensity capable of eliciting cell activation lasting beyond the end of stimulation. We conclude that selective effects of cortical electrical stimulation across cell types and layers are largely driven by their different axonal arborization and myelination profiles.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tCzLXOrg5_M" width="1" />

<p>by Ge Tan, Dimitris Polychronopoulos, Boris Lenhard</p>

Conserved Noncoding Elements (CNEs) are elements exhibiting extreme noncoding conservation in Metazoan genomes. They cluster around developmental genes and act as long-range enhancers, yet nothing that we know about their function explains the observed conservation levels. Clusters of CNEs coincide with topologically associating domains (TADs), indicating ancient origins and stability of TAD locations. This has suggested further hypotheses about the still elusive origin of CNEs, and has provided a comparative genomics-based method of estimating the position of TADs around developmentally regulated genes in genomes where chromatin conformation capture data is missing. To enable researchers in gene regulation and chromatin biology to start deciphering this phenomenon, we developed <i>CNEr</i>, a R/Bioconductor toolkit for large-scale identification of CNEs and for studying their genomic properties. We apply <i>CNEr</i> to two novel genome comparisonsâfruit fly vs tsetse fly, and two sea urchin genomesâand report novel insights gained from their analysis. We also show how to reveal interesting characteristics of CNEs by coupling <i>CNEr</i> with existing Bioconductor packages. <i>CNEr</i> is available at Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/CNEr/) and maintained at github (https://github.com/ge11232002/CNEr).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvjjIVtdQyE" width="1" />

<p>Microglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages with important functions in health and disease. To improve our understanding of these cells, the research community needs genetic tools to identify and control them in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell types. We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific <i>Tmem119</i> gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous <i>Tmem119</i> in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 primarily in microglia upon tamoxifen administration with the caveat of activity in leptomeningeal cells. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the <i>Tmem119-EGFP</i> and <i>Tmem119-CreERT2</i> lines, respectively. These new transgenic lines extend the microglia toolbox by providing the currently most specific genetic labeling and control over these cells in the myeloid compartment of mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in guiding decision making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individualâs innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the PFC guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial PFC (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake, Wistar or alcohol-preferring (P) rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.</p>

Abstract
<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are rare mammalian photoreceptors essential for non-image-forming vision functions, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that distinguish ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice that mark different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that <i>Rasgrp1</i> and <i>Tbx20</i> are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.</p>

Abstract
<p>The perirhinal (PER) and lateral entorhinal (LEC) cortex function as a gateway for information transmission between (sub)cortical areas and the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that the amygdala, a key structure in emotion processing, can modulate PER-LEC neuronal activity before information enters the hippocampal memory pathway. This study determined the integration of synaptic activity evoked by simultaneous neocortical and amygdala electrical stimulation in PER-LEC deep layer principal neurons and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mouse brain slices. The data revealed that both deep layer PER-LEC principal neurons and PV interneurons receive synaptic input from the neocortical agranular insular cortex (AiP) and the lateral amygdala (LA). Furthermore, simultaneous stimulation of the AiP and LA never reached the firing threshold in principal neurons of the PER-LEC deep layers. PV interneurons however, mainly showed linear summation of simultaneous AiP and LA inputs and reached their firing threshold earlier. This early PV firing was reflected in the forward shift of the evoked inhibitory conductance in principal neurons, thereby creating a more precise temporal window for coincidence detection, which likely plays a crucial role in information processing.</p>

Abstract<p>The primary function of language is to communicateâ that is, to make individuals reach a state of mutual understanding about a particular thought or idea. Accordingly, daily communication is truly a task of social coordination. Indeed, successful interactions require individuals to 1) track and adopt a partner's perspective, and 2) continuously shift between the numerous elements relevant to the exchange. Here, we use a referential communication task to study the contributions of perspective-taking and executive function to effective communication in non-aphasic human patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Similar to previous work, the task was to identify a target object, embedded amongst an array of competitors, for an interlocutor. Results indicate that bvFTD patients are impaired relative to controls in selecting the optimal, precise response. Neuropsychological testing related this performance to mental set-shifting, but not to working memory or inhibition. Follow-up analyses indicated that some bvFTD patients perform equally well as controls, while a second, clinically-matched patient group performs significantly worse. Importantly, the neuropsychological profiles of these subgroups differed only in set-shifting. Finally, structural MRI imaging analyses related patient impairment to gray matter disease in orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, all regions previously implicated in social cognition and overlapping those related to set-shifting. Complementary white matter analyses implicated uncinate fasciculus, which carries projections between orbitofrontal and temporal cortices. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that impaired referential communication in bvFTD is cognitively related to set-shifting, and anatomically related to a social-executive network including prefrontal cortices and uncinate fasciculus.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> While traditional models of language processing focus on single word and sentence comprehension, successful communication during conversational exchanges may involve additional executive resources and social perspective-taking. Here, we report a novel study of non-aphasic patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), who have documented deficits in social and executive function but relatively preserved language. Our findings demonstrate that patients with bvFTD have difficulty coordinating perspectives with a conversational partner in a referential communication task. Patient impairment was related to disease in a network of prefrontal regions associated with social functioning and mental set-shifting, highlighting the essential contribution of non-language brain regions to daily communication.</p>

Abstract<p>Honeybees are social insects, and individual bees take on different social roles as they mature, performing a multitude of tasks that involve multi-modal sensory integration. Several activities vital for foraging, like flight and waggle dance communication, involve sensing air vibrations through their antennae. We investigated changes in the identified vibration-sensitive interneuron DL-Int-1 in the honeybee <i>Apis mellifera</i> during maturation by comparing properties of neurons from newly emerged adult and forager honeybees. While comparison of morphological reconstructions of the neurons revealed no significant changes in gross dendritic features, consistent and region dependent changes were found in dendritic density. Comparison of electrophysiological properties showed an increase in the firing rate differences between stimulus and non-stimulus periods in foragers compared to newly emerged adult bees. The observed differences in neurons of foragers as compared to newly emerged adult honeybees suggest refined connectivity, improved signal propagation, and enhancement of response features possibly important for the network processing of air vibration signals relevant for the waggle-dance communication of honeybees.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the darkness of the hive, honeybees inform each other about profitable food sources using stereotypic movements accompanied by specific sound patterns produced by wing-beats. Here we present a study of an identified vibration-sensitive neuron, named DL-Int-1, in the honeybee brain focusing on structural and functional adaptations by comparing data from young, newly emerged adult and mature forager honeybees. We found region-dependent changes in the morphological structure of DL-Int-1 as well as specific changes in its response properties, which suggest an adaptation process during maturation leading to a refinement in network connectivity and improved processing of waggle dance signals in the honeybee brain.</p>

ABSTRACT<p><i>SHANK3</i> (<i>ProSAP2</i>) is among the most common genes mutated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and is the causative gene in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. We performed genetic rescue of <i>Shank3</i> mutant phenotypes in adult mice expressing a <i>Shank3</i> exon 21 insertion mutation (<i>Shank3<sup>G</sup></i>). We used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP system (<i>Cre<sup>Tam</sup></i>) to revert <i>Shank3<sup>G</sup></i> to wild-type <i>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup></i>. We found that tamoxifen treatment in adult <i>Shank3<sup>G</sup>Cre<sup>Tam</sup>+</i> mice resulted in complete rescue of SHANK3 protein expression in the brain and appeared to rescue synaptic transmission and some behavioral differences compared to <i>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>Cre<sup>Tam</sup>+</i> controls. However, follow-up comparisons between vehicle-treated, wild-type Cre-negative mice (<i>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>Cre<sup>Tam</sup>â</i> and <i>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>Cre<sup>Tam</sup>+</i>) demonstrated clear effects of <i>Cre<sup>Tam</sup></i> on baseline synaptic transmission and some behaviors, making apparently positive genetic reversal effects difficult to interpret. Thus, while the <i>Cre<sup>Tam</sup></i> tamoxifen-inducible system is a powerful tool that successfully rescues <i>Shank3</i> expression in our <i>Shank3<sup>G/G</sup></i> reversible mutants, one must exercise caution and use appropriate control comparisons to ensure sound interpretation.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporally and spatially controlled genetic reversal of mouse models of autism are used to determine critical windows in development for successful treatment. This study provides a clear example that any attempt at genetic reversal must be accompanied by all appropriate controls, including expression of the <i>Cre<sup>Tam</sup></i> transgene in wild-type animals, for accurate interpretation of the genetic rescue result. In addition, this study provides two additional independent replications of behavioral and synaptic electrophysiologal abnormalities in <i>Shank3</i> exon 21 mutant mouse models in the <i>Cre<sup>Tam</sup></i>-negative cohorts. Reproducibility is an important and often overlooked aspect of many mutant mouse behavioral and electrophysiological studies.</p>

Abstract<p>How do we recall vivid details from our past based only on sparse cues? Research suggests that the phenomenological reinstatement of past experiences is accompanied by neural reinstatement of the original percept. This process critically depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Within the MTL, perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) are thought to support encoding and recall of objects and scenes, respectively, with the hippocampus (HC) serving as a content-independent hub. If the fidelity of recall indeed arises from neural reinstatement of perceptual activity, then successful recall should preferentially draw upon those neural populations within content-sensitive MTL cortex that are tuned to the same content during perception. We tested this hypothesis by having eighteen human participants undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they encoded and recalled objects and scenes paired with words. Critically, recall was cued with the words only. While HC distinguished successful from unsuccessful recall of both objects and scenes, PRC and PHC were preferentially engaged during successful vs. unsuccessful object and scene recall, respectively. Importantly, within PRC and PHC, this content-sensitive recall was predicted by content tuning during perception: Across PRC voxels, we observed a positive relationship between object tuning during perception and successful object recall, while across PHC voxels, we observed a positive relationship between scene tuning during perception and successful scene recall. Our results thus highlight content-based roles of MTL cortical regions for episodic memory and reveal a direct mapping between content-specific tuning during perception and successful recall.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Episodic memory, our ability to encode and later recall experiences, involves neural overlap between perceptual and recall activity. Research has shown that this phenomenon depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Within MTL, perirhinal (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) are engaged during encoding and recall of objects and scenes, respectively, linked by content-independent hippocampus (HC). Here, we find that within MTL cortex, content tuning during perception predicts successful recall of that content: We observe a positive relationship between object tuning and object recall across PRC voxels, and between scene tuning and scene recall across PHC voxels. These results highlight the role of stimulus content for understanding MTL, and demonstrate a clear mapping between content tuning and content recall.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Genetically-modified mice have become standard tools in neuroscience research. Our understanding of the basal ganglia in particular has been greatly assisted by BAC mutants with selective transgene expression in striatal neurons forming the direct or indirect pathways. However, for more sophisticated behavioral tasks and larger intracranial implants, rat models are preferred. Furthermore, BAC lines can show variable expression patterns depending upon genomic insertion site. We therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two novel knock-in rat lines specifically encoding Cre recombinase immediately after the dopamine D1 receptor <i>(Drd1a)</i> or adenosine 2a receptor (<i>Adora2a)</i> loci. Here we validate these lines using <i>in situ</i> hybridization and viral vector mediated transfection to demonstrate selective, functional Cre expression in the striatal direct and indirect pathways respectively. We used whole-genome sequencing to confirm the lack of off-target effects, and established that both rat lines have normal locomotor activity and learning in simple instrumental and Pavlovian tasks. We expect these new D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rat lines will be widely used to study both normal brain functions and neurological and psychiatric pathophysiology.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work presents the generation and validation of two novel knock-in rat lines, We demonstrate that the Cre transgene was correctly inserted at the intended genomic locations only, and that the rats show normal behavior in a range of simple tests. We validate that Cre is expressed with high specificity and consistency, and produces functional Cre-dependent protein expression <i>in vivo</i>. Among other applications, these lines will be valuable tools for selective investigations of the striatal direct and indirect pathways.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Most homeoprotein transcription factors have a highly conserved internalization domain used in intercellular transfer. Internalization of homeoproteins ENGRAILED1 or ENGRAILED2 promotes the survival of adult dopaminergic cells, whereas that of OTX2 protects adult retinal ganglion cells. Here we characterize the <i>in vitro</i> neuroprotective activity of several homeoproteins in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Protection is observed with ENGRAILED1, ENGRAILED2, OTX2, GBX2 and LHX9 on midbrain and striatal embryonic neurons whereas cell-permeable c-MYC shows no protective effects. Therefore, five homeoproteins belonging to 3 different classes (ANTENNAPEDIA, PAIRED and LIM) share the ability to protect embryonic neurons from midbrain and striatum. Because midbrain and striatal neurons do not express the same repertoire of the 4 proteins, a lack of neuronal specificity together with a general protective activity can be proposed. Interestingly, hEN1 and GBX2 provided protection to primary midbrain astrocytes but not to non-neural cells including mouse embryo fibroblasts, macrophages or HeLa cells. For the 4 proteins, protection against cell-death correlated with a reduction in the number of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DNA break foci in midbrain and striatal neurons. In conclusion, within the limit of the number of cell types and homeoproteins tested, homeoprotein protection against oxidative stress-induced DNA breaks and death is specific to neurons and astrocytes but shows no homeoprotein or neuronal type specificity.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Homeoproteins are DNA binding proteins regulating gene expression throughout life. Many of them transfer between cells and are thus internalized by live cells. This has allowed for their use as therapeutic proteins in animal models of Parkinson disease and glaucoma. Part of their therapeutic activity is through a protection against neuronal death. Here we show that internalized homeoproteins from three different classes protect embryonic ventral midbrain and striatal neurons from oxidative stress, both at the level of DNA damage and survival. The interest of this finding is that it lends weight to the possibility that many homeoproteins play a role in neuroprotection through shared mechanisms involving, in particular, DNA protection against stress-induced breaks.</p>

<p>Neural encoding and decoding, which aim to characterize the relationship
between stimuli and brain activities, have emerged as an important area in
cognitive neuroscience. Traditional encoding models, which focus on feature
extraction and mapping, consider the brain as an input-output mapper without
inner states. In this work, inspired by the fact that human brain acts like a
state machine, we proposed a novel encoding framework that combines information
from both the external world and the inner state to predict brain activity. The
framework comprises two parts: forward encoding model that deals with visual
stimuli and inner state model that captures influence from intrinsic
connections in the brain. The forward model can be any traditional encoding
model, making the framework flexible. The inner state model is a linear model
to utilize information in the prediction residuals of the forward model. The
proposed encoding framework can achieve much better performance on natural
image identification from fMRI response than forwardonly models. The
identification accuracy will decrease slightly with the dataset size
increasing, but remain relatively stable with different identification methods.
The results confirm that the new encoding framework is effective and robust
when used for brain decoding.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08655">Spiking Neural Predictive Coding for Continual Learning from Data Streams. (arXiv:1908.08655v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>For energy-efficient computation in specialized neuromorphic hardware, we
present the Spiking Neural Coding Network, an instantiation of a family of
artificial neural models strongly motivated by the theory of predictive coding.
The model, in essence, works by operating in a never-ending process of
"guess-and-check", where neurons predict the activity values of one another and
then immediately adjust their own activities to make better future predictions.
The interactive, iterative nature of our neural system fits well into the
continuous time formulation of data sensory stream prediction and, as we show,
the model's structure yields a simple, local synaptic update rule, which could
be used to complement or replace online spike-timing dependent plasticity
rules. In this article, we experiment with an instantiation of our model that
consists of leaky integrate-and-fire units. However, the general framework
within which our model is situated can naturally incorporate more complex,
formal neurons such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our experimental results in
pattern recognition demonstrate the potential of the proposed model when binary
spike trains are the primary paradigm for inter-neuron communication. Notably,
our model is competitive in terms of classification performance, capable of
conducting online semi-supervised learning, and more computationally economical
and biologically-plausible than popular artificial neural networks.

<p>Significant hematoma expansion (HE) affects oneâfifth of people within 24 hours after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and its prevention is an appealing treatment target. Although the computed tomography (CT)âangiography spot sign predicts HE, only a minority of ICH patients receive contrast injection. Conversely, noncontrast CT (NCCT) is used to diagnose nearly all ICH, so NCCT markers represent a widely available alternative for prediction of HE. However, different NCCT signs describe similar features, with lack of consensus on the optimal image acquisition protocol, assessment, terminology, and diagnostic criteria. In this review, we propose practical guidelines for detecting, interpreting, and reporting NCCT predictors of HE. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Antibodies developed for research and clinical applications may exhibit suboptimal stability, expressibility, or affinity. Existing optimization strategies focus on surface mutations, whereas natural affinity maturation also introduces mutations in the antibody core, simultaneously improving stability and affinity. To systematically map the mutational tolerance of an antibody variable fragment (Fv), we performed yeast display and applied deep mutational scanning to an anti-lysozyme antibody and found that many of the affinity-enhancing mutations clustered at the variable light-heavy chain interface, within the antibody core. Rosetta design combined enhancing mutations, yielding a variant with tenfold higher affinity and substantially improved stability. To make this approach broadly accessible, we developed AbLIFT, an automated web server that designs multipoint core mutations to improve contacts between specific Fv light and heavy chains (http://AbLIFT.weizmann.ac.il). We applied AbLIFT to two unrelated antibodies targeting the human antigens VEGF and QSOX1. Strikingly, the designs improved stability, affinity, and expression yields. The results provide proof-of-principle for bypassing laborious cycles of antibody engineering through automated computational affinity and stability design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WAwCsfJgZkE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the extremities, generally at night, which is often relieved by movements. Genome-wide association studies have identified mutations in <i>BTBD9</i> conferring a higher risk of RLS. Knockout of the <i>BTBD9</i> homolog in mice (<i>Btbd9</i>) and fly results in motor restlessness and sleep disruption. Clinical studies have found RLS patients have structural and functional abnormalities in the striatum; however, whether and how striatal pathology contributes to the pathogenesis of RLS is not known. Here, we used magnetic resonance imaging to map regions of altered synaptic activity in basal ganglia of <i>Btbd9</i> knockout mice. We further dissected striatal circuits using patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in brain slices. Two different mouse models were generated to test the effect of specific knockout of <i>Btbd9</i> in either striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) or cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) using the electrophysiological recording, motor and sensory behavioral tests. We found that <i>Btbd9</i> knockout mice showed enhanced neural activity in the striatum, increased postsynaptic currents in the MSNs, and decreased excitability of the striatal ChIs. Knocking out <i>Btbd9</i> specifically in the striatal MSNs, but not the ChIs, led to rest-phase specific motor restlessness, sleep disturbance, and increased thermal sensation in mice, which are consistent with results obtained from the <i>Btbd9</i> complete knockout mice. Our data establish the role of <i>Btbd9</i> in regulating the activity of striatal neurons. Increased activity of the striatal MSNs, possibly through modulation by the striatal ChIs, contributes to the pathogenesis of RLS.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder affecting up to 10% of the population and its pathophysiology is largely unknown. Brain imaging studies have shown striatal involvement. However, whether and how striatal pathology contributes to the pathogenesis of RLS is not known. Polymorphisms in the <i>BTBD9</i> gene are associated with RLS. <i>Btbd9</i> complete knockout mice have RLS-like phenotypes. With a combination of methods including functional magnetic resonance imaging, brain slice electrophysiology, cell type-specific knockout, and behavioral tests, we demonstrate the importance of the striatum, especially the MSNs, in the pathogenesis of RLS. Our results also suggest a novel mechanism that can explain the effectiveness of dopaminergic drugs for the treatment of RLS patients.</p>

Abstract<p>The amplitude of the brain response to a repeated auditory stimulus is diminished as compared to the response to the first tone (T1) for interstimulus intervals (ISI) lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds. This adaptation process, called auditory sensory gating (ASG), is altered in various psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and is classically studied by focusing on early evoked cortical responses to the second tone (T2) using 500 ms ISI. However, mechanisms underlying ASG are still not well-understood. We investigated ASG in awake mice from the brainstem to cortex at variable ISIs (125-2000 ms) using high-density EEG and intracerebral recordings. While ASG decreases at longer ISIs, it is still present at durations (500-2000 ms) far beyond the time during which brain responses to T1 could still be detected. T1 induces a sequence of specific stable scalp EEG topographies that correspond to the successive activation of distinct neural networks lasting about 350 ms. These brain states remain unaltered if T2 is presented during this period, although T2 is processed by the brain, suggesting that ongoing networks of brain activity are active for longer than early evoked-potentials and are not overwritten by an upcoming new stimulus. Intracerebral recordings demonstrate that ASG is already present at the level of ventral cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus and is amplified across the hierarchy in bottom-up direction. This study uncovers the extended stability of sensory-evoked brain states and long duration of ASG, and sheds light on generators of ASG and possible interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Stimulus-evoked responses of neurons fade rapidly and last usually up to around 100 ms in small brains such as the mice brain. The brain also attenuates the response to the second of a pair of stimuli (e.g. auditory), a phenomenon that is called sensory gating (SG) and is impoverished in schizophrenia patients. Here, first, we demonstrate that SG is present in ventral cochlear nucleus, the first station of auditory pathway in the CNS, and is hierarchically organized such that SG is amplified as the signal travels from early brain regions to higher order processing areas. Second, we show that brain networks are active for longer than early evoked-potentials highlighting the importance of often-neglected late components of brain response to sensory stimuli.</p>

Abstract<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported for its beneficial effects on memory formation and various brain disorders. While the electrophysiological readout of tDCS effects is subtle, astrocytes have been demonstrated to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations during tDCS in a rodent model. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of tDCS on another major glial cell type, microglia, by histology and <i>in vivo</i> imaging. tDCS performed in awake conditions induced a significant change in the pixel intensity distribution of Iba-1 immunohistochemistry, and microglial somata were enlarged when examined 3 hr after tDCS. These effects were blocked by adrenergic receptor antagonists or in IP<sub>3</sub>R2 (inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2)-deficient mice, which lack large cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in astrocytes. No obvious changes were observed in isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging of microglia showed a reduction of motility that was blocked by a beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. Our observations add support for the influence of noradrenaline in tDCS and suggest possible interactions between microglia and astrocytes to express functional changes associated with tDCS.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation procedure in which a weak electric direct current is delivered through the brain for tens of minutes. Despite reported positive effects, the mechanisms of tDCS stimulation are not yet understood well. Here, we examined microglial morphology in the mouse cortex after tDCS. We find that the morphology and morphological dynamics of microglia are altered by tDCS in a manner dependent on adrenergic receptors, supporting the notion that (nor)adrenergic signaling is involved in tDCS.</p>

Abstract<p>Optogenetics is widely used to control diverse cellular functions with light, requiring experimenters to expose cells to bright light. Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed mouse cortical cultures with no exogenous optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing these cultures to as short as one hour of blue, but not red or green, light results in the increase in expression of neuronal-activity-regulated genes. Our findings suggest that blue light stimulation is ill-suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription, and they emphasize the importance of performing light-only control experiments in samples without optogenetic proteins.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Optogenetics is widely used to control cellular functions using light. For instance, channelrhodopsins, exogenous light-sensitive channels, allow light-dependent control of neuronal firing. This optogenetic control of firing requires exposing neurons to high-powered light. We ask how this light exposure, in the absence of channelrhodopsin, affects the expression of neuronal-activity-regulated genes, i.e., the genes that are transcribed in response to neuronal stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that neurons without channelrhodopsin express neuronal-activity-regulated genes in response to blue, but not red or green, light exposure. These findings suggest that experimenters wishing to achieve longer-term (1h+) optogenetic control over neuronal firing should avoid using systems that require blue light and should include controls to gauge the effects of light alone.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Xâlinked dystoniaâparkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease with adult onset dystonia and subsequent parkinsonism. Postmortem and imaging studies revealed remarkable striatal pathology, with a predominant involvement of the striosomal compartment in the early phase. Here, we aimed to disentangle sequential neurodegeneration in the striatum of XDP patients, provide evidence for preferential loss of distinct striatal areas in the early phase, and investigate whether iron accumulation is present.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used multimodal structural magnetic resonance imaging (voxelâbased morphometry and relaxometry) in 18 male XDP patients carrying a <i>TAF1</i> mutation and 19 ageâmatched male controls.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxelâbased relaxometry and morphometry revealed (1) a cluster in the anteromedial putamen showing high iron content and severe atrophy (â55%) and (2) a cluster with reduced relaxation rates as a marker for increased water levels and a lower degree of atrophy (â20%) in the dorsolateral putamen. Iron deposition correlated with the degree of atrophy (Ï = â0.585, <i>p</i> = 0.011) and disease duration (Ï = 0.632, <i>p</i> = 0.005) in the anteromedial putamen. In the dorsolateral putamen, sensorimotor putamen atrophy correlated with disease severity (Ï = â0.649, <i>p</i> = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This multimodal approach identified a patchy pattern of atrophy within the putamen. Atrophy is advanced and associated with iron accumulation in rostral regions of the striatum, whereas neurodegeneration is moderate and still ongoing in dorsolateral areas. Given the short disease duration and predominant dystonic phenotype, these results are well in line with early and preferential degeneration of striosomeârich striatal areas in XDP.

Synaptic transmission has been studied for decades, as a fundamental step in brain function. The structure of the synapse, and its changes during activity, turned out to be key aspects not only in the transfer of information between neurons, but also in cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The overall synaptic morphology has traditionally been studied by electron microscopy, which enables the visualization of synaptic structure in great detail. The changes in the organization of easily identified structures, such as the presynaptic active zone, or the postsynaptic density, are optimally studied via electron microscopy. However, few reliable methods are available for labeling individual organelles or protein complexes in electron microscopy. For such targets one typically relies either on combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy, or on super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This review focuses on approaches and techniques used to specifically reveal synaptic organelles and protein complexes, such as cytoskeletal assemblies. We place the strongest emphasis on methods detecting the targets of interest by affinity binding, and we discuss the advantages and limitations of each method

Phosphoinositides, the seven phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol have emerged as key regulators of multiple sub-cellular processes such as membrane transport, cytoskeletal function and signalling in eukaryotic cells. All of these processes are also present in the cells that constitute the nervous system of animals and in this setting too phosphoinositides are likely to regulate key aspects of cell biology tuned to the unique aspects of cell biology of neurons. Phosphoinositides metabolism and function are mediated by enzymes and proteins that are conserved in evolution and analysis of knockouts of these in animal models implicate this signalling system in neural function. Most recently, with the advent of human genome analysis, mutations that impact components of the phosphoinositide signalling pathway has been implicated in human diseases although the cell biological basis of disease in many cases remains unclear. In this review we evaluate existing evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide signalling in human nervous system diseases and discuss ways of enhancing our understanding of the role of this pathway in human nervous system function in health and disease.

Effective treatments for pain management remain elusive due to the dangerous side-effects of current gold-standard opioid analgesics, including the respiratory depression that has led to skyrocketing death rates from opioid overdoses over the past decade. In an attempt to address the horrific opioid crisis worldwide, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has recently proposed boosting research on specific pharmacological mechanisms mediated by a number of G protein-coupled receptors. This research is expected to expedite the discovery of medications for opioid overdose and opioid use disorders, leading towards a safer and more effective treatment of pain. Here, we review mechanistic insights from recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a specific subset of GPCRs for which high-resolution experimental structures are available, including opioid, cannabinoid, orexin, metabotropic glutamate, and dopamine receptor subtypes.

Background
Early exposure to nociceptive events may cause brain structural alterations in preterm neonates (PN), with long-lasting consequences on neurodevelopmental outcome. Little is known on the extent to which early pain may affect brain connectivity. We aim to evaluate brain functional connectivity changes in PN that underwent multiple invasive procedures during the postnatal period, and to correlate them with the neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months. 
Methods
In this prospective case-control study, we collected information about exposure to painful events during the early postnatal period and resting-state BOLD-fMRI data at term equivalent age from two groups of PN:  33 subjected to painful procedures during the neonatal intensive care (mean gestational age 26.9Â±1.8 weeks) and 13 who did not require invasive procedures (average gestational age 31.2Â±2.1 weeks). A data-driven principal-component-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to investigate the effect of early pain exposure on brain functional connectivity, and the relationship between connectivity changes and neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months, assessed with GriffithsâDevelopmental Scale-Revised:0-2.
Results
Early pain was associated with decreased functional connectivity between thalami and bilateral somatosensory cortex, and between the right insular cortex and ipsilateral amygdala and hippocampal regions, with a more evident effect in PN undergoing more invasive procedures. Functional connectivity of the right thalamocortical pathway was related to neuromotor outcome at 24 months (P=.003). 
Conclusions
Early exposure to pain is associated with abnormal functional connectivity of developing networks involved in the modulation of noxious stimuli in PN, contributing to the neurodevelopmental consequence of preterm birth.

The inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a white matter tract that connects the occipital and the temporal lobes. ILF abnormalities have been associated with deficits in visual processing and language comprehension in dementia patients, thus suggesting that its integrity is important for semantic processing. However, it remains elusive whether ILF microstructural organization per se impacts the visual semantic processing efficiency in the healthy brain. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between ILFâs microstructural organization and visual semantic processing at the individual level. We hypothesized that the efficiency of visual semantic processing positively correlates with the degree of anisotropy of the ILF. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We determined fractional anisotropy (FA) of the ILF using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted N400m latency and amplitude from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during a visual semantic decision task. N400m and mean FA of the ILF were left lateralized with the higher FA value in the left hemisphere. Inter-individual analysis showed that FA of the ILF negatively correlated with the N400m latency and amplitude, which suggests that high ILF anisotropy is associated with more efficient semantic processing. In summary, our findings provide supporting evidence for a role of the ILF in language comprehension.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00874">A Fully Automatic Framework for Parkinsonâs Disease Diagnosis by Multi-Modality Images</a></h4>

Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent long-term neurodegenerative disease. Though the criteria of PD diagnosis are relatively well defined, current diagnostic procedures using medical images are labor-intensive and expertise-demanding. Hence, highly integrated automatic diagnostic algorithms are desirable.
Methods: In this work, we propose an end-to-end multi-modality diagnostic framework, including segmentation, registration, feature extraction and machine learning, to analyze the features of striatum for PD diagnosis. Multi-modality images, including T1-weighted MRI and 11C-CFT PET, are integrated into the proposed framework. The reliability of this method is validated on a dataset with the paired images from 49 PD subjects and 18 Normal (NL) subjects.
Results: We obtained a promising diagnostic accuracy in the PD/NL classification task. Meanwhile, several comparative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed framework.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that (1) the automatic segmentation provides accurate results for the diagnostic framework, (2) the method combining multi-modality images generates a better prediction accuracy than the method with single-modality PET images, and (3) the volume of the striatum is proved to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.

Brain functioning relies on various segregated/specialized neural regions functioning as an integrated-interconnected network (i.e. metastability). Various psychiatric and neurologic disorders are associated with aberrant functioning of these brain networks. In this study, we present a novel framework integrating the strength and temporal variability of metastability in brain networks. We demonstrate that this approach provides novel mechanistic insights which enables better imaging-based predictions. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI and a graph-theoretic framework, we integrated strength and temporal-variability of complex-network properties derived from effective connectivity networks, obtained from 87 U.S. Army soldiers consisting of healthy combat controls (n=28), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n=17), and PTSD with comorbid mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI; n=42). We identified prefrontal dysregulation of key subcortical and visual regions in PTSD/mTBI, with all network properties exhibiting lower variability over time, indicative of poorer flexibility. Larger impairment in the prefrontal-subcortical pathway but not prefrontal-visual pathway differentiated comorbid PTSD/mTBI from the PTSD group. Network properties of the prefrontal-subcortical pathway also had significant association (R2=0.56) with symptom severity and neurocognitive performance; and were also found to possess high predictive ability (81.4% accuracy in classifying the disorders, explaining 66-72% variance in symptoms), identified through machine learning. Our framework explained 13% more variance in behaviors compared to the conventional framework. These novel insights and better predictions were made possible by our novel framework using static and time-varying network properties in our 3-group scenario, advancing the mechanistic understanding of PTSD and comorbid mTBI. Our contribution has wide-ranging applications for network-level characterization of healthy brains as well as mental disorders.

The current study examined whether emotional expectations gate attention to emotional words in early visual cortex. Colour cues informed about word valence and onset latency. We observed a stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) prior to the onset of cued words that was larger for negative than for neutral words. This indicates that emotional words are more anticipated than neutral words before target onset. During stimulus presentation the Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), elicited by flickering words, was attenuated for cued compared to uncued words, indicating sharpened sensory activity i.e. expectation suppression. Most importantly, the SSVEP was more enhanced for negative than neutral words when these were cued. Uncued conditions did not differ in SSVEP amplitudes, paralleling previous studies reporting lexico-semantic but not early visual effects of emotional words. We suggest that cueing mediates the capture of visual resources by providing an early âemotional gistâ of an upcoming word. Consequently, visual single-word studies may have underestimated attentional effects of emotional words and their anticipation during reading.

Conscious memories are critically dependent upon the bilateral hippocampal formation, and interhemispheric commissural projections made by mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. GABAergic interneurons also make long-range axonal projections, but little is known regarding their commissural, inter-hippocampal connections. We used retrograde and adeno-associated viral tracing, immunofluorescent and electron microscopy, and in vitro optogenetics to assess contralateral projections of neurochemically defined interneuron classes. We found that contralateral-projecting interneurons were 24-fold less common compared to hilar mossy cells, and mostly consisted of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing types. Somatostatin-expressing cells made denser contralateral axonal projections than parvalbumin-expressing cells, although this was typically 10-fold less than the ipsilateral projection density. Somatostatin-expressing cells displayed a topographic-like innervation according to the location of their somata, whereas parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly innervated CA1. In the dentate gyrus molecular layer, commissural interneuron post-synaptic targets were predominantly putative granule cell apical dendrites. In the hilus, varicosities in close vicinity to various interneuron subtypes, as well as mossy cells, were observed, but most contralateral axon varicosities had no adjacent immunolabelled structure. Due to the relative sparsity of the connection and the likely distal dendritic location of their synapses, commissural projections made by interneurons were found to be weak. We postulate that these projections may become functionally active upon intense network activity during tasks requiring increased memory processing.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00393">Temporal Control of Axonal Transport: The Extreme Case of Organismal Ageing</a></h4>

A fundamental question in cell biology is how cellular components are delivered to their destination with spatial and temporal precision within the crowded cytoplasmic environment. The long processes of neurons represent a significant spatial challenge and make these cells particularly dependent on mechanisms for long-range cytoskeletal transport of proteins, RNA and organelles. Although many studies have substantiated a role for defective transport of axonal cargoes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, remarkably little is known about how transport is regulated throughout ageing. The scale of the challenge posed by ageing is considerable because, in this case, the temporal regulation of transport is ultimately dictated by the length of organismal lifespan, which can extend to days, years or decades.
 	Recent methodological advances to study live axonal transport during ageing in situ have provided new tools to scratch beneath the surface of this complex problem and revealed that age-dependent decline in the transport of mitochondria is a common feature across different neuronal populations of several model organisms. In certain instances, the molecular pathways that affect transport in ageing animals have begun to emerge. However, the functional implications of these observations are still not fully understood. Whether transport decline is a significant determinant of neuronal ageing or a mere consequence of decreased cellular fitness remains an open question. 
	In this review, we discuss the latest developments in axonal trafficking in the ageing nervous system, along with the early studies that inaugurated this new area of research. We explore the possibility that the interplay between mitochondrial function and motility represents a crucial driver of ageing in neurons and put forward the hypothesis that declining axonal transport may be legitimately considered a hallmark of neuronal ageing.

RAD6 participates in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair by ubiquitinating histone H2B in mitotic cells. In terminally differentiated cells, however, the mechanisms of DNA damage repair are less well known. In this study, we investigate whether RAD6B is involved in DSBs repair in neurons and effects of RAD6B deficiency on neuronal survival. We compared neurons of RAD6B-deficient mice with those of littermate wild type (WT) mice and induced DNA damage by X-ray irradiation. We provide evidence that RAD6B is essential for neural DDR and RAD6B deficiency results in increased genomic instability and neurodegeneration. Moreover, higher levels of p53 and p21 are present in the brains of RAD6B-deficient mice, which may be responsible for neuronal senescence and degeneration. In addition, behavioral experiments show that RAD6B-deficient mice exhibit marked learning and memory deficits. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RAD6B is critical for neural integrity and that the absence of RAD6B accelerates neurodegeneration in mice.

In mammals, reproduction is regulated by a wide range of metabolic hormones that maintain the proper energy balance. In addition to regulating feeding and energy expenditure, these metabolic messengers also modulate the functional performance of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Secretin, a member of the secretin-glucagon-vasoactive intestinal peptide hormone family, has been shown to alter reproduction centrally, although the underlying mechanisms have not been explored yet. In order to elucidate its central action in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction, in vitro electrophysiological slice experiments were carried out on GnRH-GFP neurons in male mice. Bath application of secretin (100 nM) signiï¬cantly increased the frequency of the spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) to 118.0 Â± 2.64% compared to the control, and that of the GABAergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) to 147.6 Â± 19.19 %. Resting membrane potential became depolarized by 12.74 Â± 4.539 mV after secretin treatment. Frequency of evoked action potentials also increased to 144.3 Â± 10.8 %. The secretin-triggered elevation of the frequency of mPSCs was prevented by using either a secretin receptor antagonist (3 ÂµM) or intracellularly applied G-protein-coupled receptor blocker (GDP-Î²-S; 2 mM) supporting the involvement of secretin receptor in the process. Regarding the actions downstream to secretin receptor, intracellular blockade of protein kinase A (PKA) with KT-5720 (2 ÂµM) or intracellular inhibition of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by NPLA (1 ÂµM) abolished the stimulatory effect of secretin on mPSCs. These data suggest that secretin acts on GnRH neurons via secretin receptors whose activation triggers the cAMP/PKA/nNOS signaling pathway resulting in nitric oxide release and in the presynaptic terminals this retrograde NO machinery regulates the GABAergic input to GnRH neurons.

<p>by Somnath Tagore, Alessandro Gorohovski, Lars Juhl Jensen, Milana Frenkel-Morgenstern</p>

Tailored therapy aims to cure cancer patients effectively and safely, based on the complex interactions between patients' genomic features, disease pathology and drug metabolism. Thus, the continual increase in scientific literature drives the need for efficient methods of data mining to improve the extraction of useful information from texts based on patients' genomic features. An important application of text mining to tailored therapy in cancer encompasses the use of mutations and cancer fusion genes as moieties that change patients' cellular networks to develop cancer, and also affect drug metabolism. Fusion proteins, which are derived from the slippage of two parental genes, are produced in cancer by chromosomal aberrations and trans-splicing. Given that the two parental proteins for predicted fusion proteins are known, we used our previously developed method for identifying chimeric proteinâprotein interactions (ChiPPIs) associated with the fusion proteins. Here, we present a validation approach that receives fusion proteins of interest, predicts their cellular network alterations by ChiPPI and validates them by our new method, ProtFus, using an online literature search. This process resulted in a set of 358 fusion proteins and their corresponding protein interactions, as a training set for a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier, to identify predicted fusion proteins that have reliable evidence in the literature and that were confirmed experimentally. Next, for a test group of 1817 fusion proteins, we were able to identify from the literature 2908 PPIs in total, across 18 cancer types. The described method, ProtFus, can be used for screening the literature to identify unique cases of fusion proteins and their PPIs, as means of studying alterations of protein networks in cancers.

Abstract
<p>Alpha rhythm (8â13 Hz) is linked to relaxed mental state in humans. Earlier reports have shown that individuals can increase their alpha power if provided with a valid feedback, compared to controls who are provided invalid feedback. However, these results remain controversial, partly because controls may be in a different behavioral state, making it difficult to directly compare their alpha power with the valid group. We here address this issue by using an experimental paradigm in which an invalid feedback is given on a fraction of trials, such that both valid and invalid conditions can be obtained from the same participant. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded alpha power from the occipital area from 24 humans (nine females) and played a feedback tone which could be valid (tone frequency proportional to alpha power), invalid (tone sequence from a previous valid trial; participants were unaware of this condition), or neutral (constant tone frequency). We found that during eyes closed-state, neurofeedback did not enhance alpha activity beyond pre-trained state within the experimental duration, probably because of saturation of alpha rhythmicity. However, for participants whose alpha power decreased over time within a trial, valid feedback helped them to sustain alpha more than invalid feedback. Further, alpha increase showed a weak negative correlation with their self-reported attentional load but was uncorrelated with relaxation levels. Our results reconcile many conflicting reports in the neurofeedback literature, and show that even under most stringent control, valid neurofeedback can help participants who are otherwise unable to sustain their alpha activity.</p>

<p>The human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with tightly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. In order to study human cortical function, we recently developed a method to generate cortical neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that form both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. These cultures and organoids recapitulate neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers and a balanced excitatory and inhibitory network that is functional and homeostatically stable. To determine whether hiPSC-derived neurons can integrate and retain physiologic activities <i>in vivo</i>, we labeled hiPSCs with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and introduced hiPSC-derived neural progenitors to rat brains. Efficient neural induction, followed by differentiation resulted in a RFP<sup>+</sup> neural population with traits of forebrain identity and a balanced synaptic activity composed of both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Ten weeks after transplantation, grafted cells structurally integrated into the rat forebrain. Remarkably, these hiPSC-derived neurons were able to fire, exhibiting both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which culminates in the establishment of neuronal connectivity with the host circuitry.

Abstract
<p>As NASA prepares for a mission to Mars, concerns regarding the health risks associated with deep space radiation exposure have emerged. Until now, the impacts of such exposures have only been studied in animals after acute exposures, using dose rates ~1.5<font face="arial,helvetica">x</font>10<sup>5</sup> higher than those actually encountered in space. Using a new, low dose-rate neutron irradiation facility, we have uncovered that realistic, low dose-rate exposures produce serious neurocognitive complications associated with impaired neurotransmission. Chronic (6 month) low-dose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/d) exposures of mice to a mixed field of neutrons and photons result in diminished hippocampal neuronal excitability and disrupted hippocampal and cortical long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice displayed severe impairments in learning and memory, and the emergence of distress behaviors. Behavioral analyses showed an alarming increase in risk associated with these realistic simulations, revealing for the first time, some unexpected potential problems associated with deep space travel on all levels of neurological function.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal cord atrophy is a clinically relevant feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), but longitudinal assessments on magnetic resonance imaging using segmentationâbased methods suffer from measurement variability, especially in multicenter studies. We compared the generalized boundary shift integral (GBSI), a registrationâbased method, with a standard segmentationâbased method.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline and 1âyear spinal cord 3âdimensional T1âweighted images (1mm isotropic) were obtained from 282 patients (52 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 196 relapsingâremitting MS [RRMS], 34 progressive MS [PMS]), and 82 controls from 8 MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis) sites on multimanufacturer and multiâfieldâstrength scans. Spinal Cord Toolbox was used for C2â5 segmentation and crossâsectional area (CSA) calculation. After cord straightening and registration, GBSI measured atrophy based on the probabilistic boundaryâshift region of interest. CSA and GBSI percentage annual volume change was calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GBSI provided similar rates of atrophy, but reduced measurement variability compared to CSA in all MS subtypes (CIS: â0.95âÂ±â2.11% vs â1.19âÂ±â3.67%; RRMS: â1.74âÂ±â2.57% vs â1.74âÂ±â4.02%; PMS: â2.29âÂ±â2.40% vs â1.29âÂ±â3.20%) and healthy controls (0.02âÂ±â2.39% vs â0.56âÂ±â3.77%). GBSI performed better than CSA in differentiating healthy controls from CIS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.66 vs 0.53; <i>p</i> = 0.03), RRMS (AUC = 0.73 vs 0.59; <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001), PMS (AUC = 0.77 vs 0.53; <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001), and patients with disability progression from patients without progression (AUC = 0.59 vs 0.50; <i>p</i> = 0.04). Sample size to detect 60% treatment effect on spinal cord atrophy over 1 year was lower for GBSI than CSA (CIS: 106 vs 830; RRMS: 95 vs 335; PMS: 44 vs 215; power = 80%; alpha = 5%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The registrationâbased method (GBSI) allowed better separation between MS patients and healthy controls and improved statistical power, when compared with a conventional segmentationâbased method (CSA), although it is still far from perfect. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Alzheimerâs disease is the most common type of dementia which characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function due to degeneration of synapses and axons. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimerâs disease. Deposition of extracellular amyloid-Î² plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are two major hallmark pathologic changes in  the brain of Alzheimer's patient. Autophagy is the major mechanism in cells responsible for removing protein aggregates. Anormalous immature autophagic vacuoles accumulated in dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer patient's brain suggests that autophagy process is disturbed. It is not yet clear whether autophagy plays a causative role, a protective role or just a consequence of the disease process itself. Understanding the exact role of autophagy in different stages of Alzheimerâs disease progression may help to design more effective therapeutic strategies towards this devastating disorder.

Abstract
The human brain is thought to be an extremely complex but efficient computing engine, processing vast amounts of information from a changing world. The decline in the synaptic density of neuronal networks is one of the most important characteristics of brain development, which is closely related to synaptic pruning, synaptic growth, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. However, because of technical limitations in observing large-scale neuronal networks dynamically connected through synapses, how neuronal networks are organized and evolve as their synaptic density declines remains unclear. Here, by establishing a biologically reasonable neuronal network model, we show that despite a decline in the synaptic density, the connectivity and efficiency of neuronal networks can be improved. Importantly, by analysing the degree distribution, we also find that both the scale-free characteristic of neuronal networks and the emergence of hub neurons rely on the spatial distance between neurons. These findings may promote our understanding of neuronal networks in the brain and have guiding significance for the design of neuronal network models.

Accumulation and aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein is believed to be a cause of Parkinsonâs disease (PD). Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at S129 is known to be associated with the pathological misfolding process, but efforts to investigate the relevance of this post-translational modification for pathology have been frustrated by difficulties in detecting and quantifying it in relevant samples. We report novel, ultrasensitive immunoassays based on single-molecule counting technology, useful for detecting alpha-synuclein and its S129 phosphorylated form in clinical samples in the low pg/ml range. Using human CSF and plasma samples, we find levels of alpha-synuclein comparable to those previously reported. However, while alpha-synuclein phosphorylated on S129 could easily be detected in human plasma, where its detection is extremely sensitive to protein phosphatases, its levels in CSF were undetectable, with a possible influence of a matrix effect. In plasma samples from a small test cohort comprising 5 PD individuals and 5 age-matched control individuals we find that pS129 alpha-synuclein levels are increased in PD plasma samples, in line with previous reports. We conclude that pS129 alpha-synuclein is not detectable in CSF and recommend the addition of phosphatase inhibitors to plasma samples at the time of collection. Moreover, the findings obtained on the small cohort of clinical plasma samples point to plasma pS129 alpha-synuclein levels as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in PD.

The study of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) has been important to understand the healthy and diseased brain. Recent developments model groups of functionally related brain structures (defined as functional domains) as entities that can send and receive information. A domain analysis starts by detecting a finite set of connectivity patterns known as domain states within each functional domain. Dynamic functional domain connectivity (DFDC) is a novel information theoretic framework for studying the temporal sequence of the domain states and the amount of information shared among domains. In this setting, the information flow among functional domains can be compared to the flow of bits among entities in a digital network. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder which is associated with how the brain processes information. Here we employed the DFDC framework to analyze a dataset containing resting-state fMRI scans from 163 healthy controls (HCs) and 151 schizophrenia patients (SZs). As in other information theory methods, this study measured domain state probabilities, entropy within each DFDC and the cross-domain mutual information (CDMI) between pairs of DFDC. Results indicate that SZs show significantly higher (transformed) entropy than HCs in subcortical (SC)-SC; default mode network (DMN)-visual (VIS) and frontoparietal (FRN)-VIS DFDCs. SZs also show lower (transformed) CDMI between SC-VIS vs SC-sensorimotor (SM), attention (ATTN)-VIS vs ATTN-SM and ATTN-SM vs ATTN-ATTN DFDC pairs after correcting for multiple comparisons. These results imply that different DFDC pairs function in a more independent manner in SZs compared to HCs. Our findings present evidence of higher uncertainty and randomness in SZ brain function.

Background: Sensory deprivation, such as hearing loss, has been demonstrated to change the intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) of the brain, as measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Patients with sloping sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are a unique population among the hearing impaired, as they have all been exposed to some auditory input throughout their lifespan and all use spoken language. Material and Methods: Twenty patients with SNHL and 21 control subjects participated in a rs-fMRI study. Whole-brain seed-driven FC maps were obtained, with audiological scores of patients, including hearing loss severity and speech performance, used as covariates. Results: Most profound differences in FC were found between patients with prelingual (before language development, PRE) vs postlingual onset (after language development, POST) of SNHL. An early onset was related to enhancement in long-range network connections, including the default-mode network, the dorsal-attention network and the fronto-parietal network, as well as in local sensory networks, the visual and the sensorimotor. A number of multisensory brain regions in frontal and parietal cortices, as well as the cerebellum, were also more internally connected. We interpret these effects as top-down mechanisms serving optimization of multisensory experience in SNHL with a prelingual onset. At the same time, POST patients showed enhanced FC between the salience network and multisensory parietal areas, as well as with the hippocampus, when they were compared to those with PRE hearing loss. Signal in several cortex regions subserving visual processing was also more intra-correlated in POST vs PRE patients. This outcome might point to more attention resources directed to multisensory as well as memory experience. Finally, audiological scores correlated with FC in several sensory and high-order brain regions in all patients. Conclusions: The results show that a sloping hearing loss is related to altered resting-state brain organization. Effects were shown in attention and cognitive control networks, as well as visual and sensorimotor regions. Specifically, we found that even in a partial hearing deficit (affecting only some of the hearing frequency ranges), the age at the onset affects the brain function differently, pointing to the role of sensitive periods in brain development.

When retrieval occurs concomitantly with novelty detection, mismatch perception or reactivation of conflicting information, consolidated memories can enter into a labile state and, to persist, must be restabilized through a protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process during which their strength and content can be modified. Extensive literature implicates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, in the acquisition, consolidation and extinction of several memory types. However, the participation of BDNF in memory reconsolidation has been less studied. In this review, we discuss recent reports supporting the involvement of BDNF signaling in reactivation-induced memory updating.

Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposits and some proteins play some essential roles in AD pathogenesis. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging as an indicator of tissue protein has shown promise for AD diseases. In this study, we chose 20 AD model rats as the experimental group and 20 sham-operated rats as the control group. They were firstly underwent Y-maze test, and then performed on a 7.0 T animal MRI scanner to acquire brain amide proton transfer image using saturation with frequency alternating RF irradiation (APTSAFARI) method. Compared with the control group, APT (3.5ppm) values of brain were significantly reduced in AD models (p&lt;0.002). The APTSAFARI imaging is more significantly than APT imaging (p&lt;0.0001). The Y-maze showed there were loss spatial learning and memory in the AD model, as well as significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus CA1 region and cortex compared with sham-operated rat. In conclusion, we demonstrated that APT technology could potentially provide molecular biomarkers for the noninvasive diagnosis of AD. These results suggested that APTSAFARI MRI could be used as an effective tool to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of AD as a possible biomarker.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizure at onset (SaO) has been considered a relative contraindication for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke, although this appraisal is not evidenceâbased. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of SaO in patients treated with IVT for suspected ischemic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, IVTâregistryâbased study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, ECASSâII definition), 3âmonth mortality and 3âmonth functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching and inverse probability weighted analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 10,074 IVTâtreated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher NIHSS and glucose on admission and more often female sex, prior stroke and prior functional dependence than nonâSaO patients. In unadjusted analysis, they had generally less favorable outcomes. After controlling for confounders in adjusted, matched and weighted analyses, all associations between SaO and any of the outcomes disappeared, including sICH (odds ratio [OR]<sub>unadjusted</sub> 1.53 [95% confidence interval: 0.74,3.14], OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.52[0.13,2.16], OR<sub>matched</sub> 0.68[0.15,3.03], OR<sub>weighted</sub> 0.95[0.39,2.32]), mortality (OR<sub>unadjusted</sub> 1.49[1.00,2.24], OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.98[0.5,1.92], OR<sub>matched</sub> 1.13[0.55,2.33]<sub>,</sub> OR<sub>weighted</sub> 1.17[0.73,1.88]) and functional outcome (mRSâ¥3 / ordinal mRS: OR<sub>unadjusted</sub> 1.33[0.96,1.84] / 1.35[1.01,1.81], OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 0.78[0.45,1.32] / 0.78[0.52,1.16], OR<sub>matched</sub> 0.75[0.43,1.32] / 0.45[0.10,2.06], OR<sub>weighted</sub> 0.87[0.57,1.34] / 1.00[0.66,1.52]). These results were consistent regardless of whether patients had an eventual diagnosis of ischemic stroke (89/146) or stroke mimic (57/146 SaO patients).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SaO was not an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Withholding IVT from patients with assumed ischemic stroke presenting with SaO seems unjustified.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes have gained attention as important players in neurological disease. In line with their heterogeneous character, defects in specific astrocyte subtypes have been identified. Leukodystrophy Vanishing White Matter shows selective vulnerability in white matter astrocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell technology is extensively being explored in studies of pathophysiology and regenerative medicine. However, models for distinct astrocyte subtypes for VWM are lacking, thereby hampering identification of diseaseâspecific pathways.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here we characterize human and mouse pluripotent stem cellâderived grey and white matter astrocyte subtypes to generate an in vitro Vanishing White Matter model. We examined morphology and functionality, and used coâculture methods, highâcontent microscopy and RNA sequencing to study Vanishing White Matter cultures.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found intrinsic vulnerability in specific astrocyte subpopulations in Vanishing White Matter. When comparing Vanishing White Matter and control cultures, white matterâlike astrocytes inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, and showed affected pathways in both human and mouse cultures, involving the immune system and extracellular matrix. Interestingly, human white matterâlike astrocytes presented additional, humanâspecific disease mechanisms, such as neuronal and mitochondrial functioning.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Astrocyte subtype cultures revealed diseaseâspecific pathways in Vanishing White Matter. Crossâvalidation of human and mouseâderived protocols identified humanâspecific disease aspects. This study provides new insights into VWM disease mechanisms which helps the development of <i>in vivo</i> regenerative applications, and we further present strategies to study astrocyte subtype vulnerability in neurological disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leukoencephalopathies comprise a broad spectrum of disorders, but the genetic background of adult leukoencephalopathies has rarely been assessed. In this study, we analyzed 101 Japanese patients with genetically unresolved adult leukoencephalopathy using wholeâexome sequencing and repeatâprimed PCR for detecting GGC expansion in <i>NOTCH2NLC</i>. <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. We found 12 patients with GGC expansion in <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> as the most frequent cause of adult leukoencephalopathy followed by <i>NOTCH3</i> variants in our cohort. Further, we found one case with <i>de novo</i> GGC expansion, which might explain the underlying pathogenesis of sporadic cases.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess patterns and impact of small nerve fiber dysfunction and pathology in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred seventeen women with FMS underwent neurological examination, questionnaire assessment, neurophysiology assessment, and small fiber tests: skin punch biopsy, corneal confocal microscopy, microneurography, quantitative sensory testing including Câtactile afferents, and painârelated evoked potentials. Data were compared with those of women with major depressive disorder and chronic widespread pain (MDâP) and healthy women.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was reduced at different biopsy sites in 63% of FMS patients (MDâP: 10%, controls: 18%; <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001 for each). We found 4 patterns of skin innervation in FMS: normal, distally reduced, proximally reduced, and both distally and proximally reduced (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.01 for each compared to controls). Microneurography revealed initial activityâdependent acceleration of conduction velocity upon low frequencies of stimulation in 1A fibers, besides 1B fiber spontaneous activity and mechanical sensitization in FMS patients. FMS patients had elevated warm detection thresholds (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.01), impaired Câtactile afferents (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.05), and reduced amplitudes (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001) of painârelated evoked potentials compared to controls. Compared to FMS patients with normal skin innervation, those with generalized IENFD reduction had higher pain intensity and impairment due to pain, higher disease burden, more stabbing pain and paresthesias, and more anxiety (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.05 for each). FMS patients with generalized IENFD reduction also had lower corneal nerve fiber density (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.01) and length (<i>p</i>â&lt;â0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of small fiber pathology is related to symptom severity in FMS. This knowledge may have implications for the diagnostic classification and treatment of patients with FMS. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Synchronization is one of the brain mechanisms allowing the coordination of neuronal activity required in many cognitive tasks. Anticipated Synchronization (AS) is a specific type of out-of-phase synchronization that occurs when two systems are unidirectionally coupled and, consequently, the information is transmitted from the sender to the receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. It has been shown that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of AS as part of a normal neurocognitive function. However, it is still unclear which mechanism gives rise to anticipated synchronization in neuronal motifs. Here, we investigate the synchronization properties of cortical motifs on multiple scales and show that the internal free running frequency of the receiver can be an important ingredient for AS to occur.
For biologically plausible parameters, including excitation/inhibition balance, we found that the phase difference between the sender and the receiver decreases when the free running frequency of the receiver increases. As a consequence, the system switches from the usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime to an AS regime. We show that at three different scales, neuronal microcircuits, spiking neuronal populations and neural mass models, both the inhibitory loop and the external current acting on the receiver change its free running frequency. This change may cause the receiver system to operate in an AS regime.

A key question in systems neuroscience is to identify how sensory stimuli are represented in neuronal activity, and how the activity of sensory neurons in turn is ``read out'' by downstream neurons and give rise to behavior. The choice of proper model system to adress these questions, hence, is a crucial step. Over the past decade, the increasingly powerful array of experimental approaches that has become available in non-primate models (e.g. optogenetics and two-photon imaging) has spurred a renewed interest for the use of rodent models in systems neuroscience research. Here we introduce the rodent whisker-mediated touch system as a structurally well-established and well-organized model system which despite its simplicity gives rises to complex behaviors. This system serves as a behaviorally efficient model system; known as nocturnal animals, along with their olfaction, rodents rely on their whisker-mediated touch system to collect information about their surrounding environment. Moreover, this system represents a well-studied circuitry with a somatotopic organization: at every stage of processing, one can identify anatomical and functional topographic maps of whiskers: ``barrelettes'' in the brainstem nuclei, ``barreloids'' in the sensory thalamus, and ``barrels'' in the cortex. This article provides a brief review to the basic anatomy and function of the whisker system in rodents.

Physiological studies documented highly specific corticofugal modulations making subcortical centers focus processing on sounds that the auditory cortex has experienced to be important. Here, we show the effects of focal conditioning of the primary auditory cortex (FCAI) on auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes and latencies in house mice. FCAI significantly increased ABR peak amplitudes (peaks I â V), decreased thresholds, and shortened peak latencies in responses to the frequency tuned by conditioned cortical neurons. The amounts of peak amplitude increases and latency decreases were specific for each processing level up to the auditory midbrain. The data provide new insights in possible corticofugal modulation of inner hair cell synapses and new corticofugal effects as neuronal enhancement of processing in the superior olivary complex and lateral lemniscus. Thus, our comprehensive ABR approach confirms the role of the auditory cortex as instructor of lower auditory levels and extends this role specifically to the cochlea, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus. The whole pathway from the cochlea to the inferior colliculus appears, in a common mode, instructed in a very similar way.

Recent investigations of the rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC) suggest that this region plays a central role in action control together with the frontal cortical areas. Posterior parietal-frontal cortical connections have been described in rats, but little is known about whether these connections are topographically organized as in the primate. Here we injected retrograde and anterograde tracers into subdivisions of PPC as well as the frontal midline and orbital cortical areas to explore possible topographies within their connections. We found that PPC projects to several frontal cortical areas, largely reciprocating the densest input received from the same areas. All PPC subdivisions are strongly connected with the secondary motor cortex (M2) in a topographically organized manner. The medial subdivision (mPPC) has a dense reciprocal connection with the most caudal portion of M2 (cM2), whereas the lateral subdivision (lPPC) and the caudolateral subdivision (PtP) are reciprocally connected with the intermediate rostrocaudal portion of M2 (iM2). Sparser reciprocal connections were seen with anterior cingulate area 24b. mPPC connects with rostral, and lPPC and PtP connect with caudal parts of 24b, respectively. There are virtually no connections with area 24a, nor with prelimbic or infralimbic cortex. PPC and orbitofrontal cortices are also connected, showing a gradient such that mPPC entertains reciprocal connections mainly with the ventral orbitofrontal cortex, whereas lPPC and PtP are preferentially connected with medial and central portions of ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. Our results thus indicate that the connections of PPC with frontal cortices are organized in a topographical fashion, supporting functional heterogeneity within PPC and frontal cortices.

Biological treatment development for syndromal neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism has seen slow progress for decades. Speeding drug discovery may result from the judicious development and application of biomarker measures of brain function to select patients for clinical trials, to confirm target engagement and to optimize drug dose. For neurodevelopmental disorders, electrophysiology (EEG) offers considerable promise because of its ability to monitor brain activity with high temporal resolution and its more ready application for pediatric populations relative to MRI. Here, we discuss conceptual/definitional issues related to biomarker development, discuss practical implementation issues, and suggest preliminary guidelines for validating EEG approaches as biomarkers with a context of use in neurodevelopmental disorder drug development.

Chronic pain is a major health problem, which would impair life quality and reduce productivity. Electroacupuncture (EA), a modality of medicine based on the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine, presents great therapeutic effects on chronic pain. The clinic application has gained increasing popularity, and in parallel, more researches have been performed on the mechanisms of EA-induced analgesia. The past decades have seen enormous advances both in neuronal circuitry of needle-insertion and in its molecular mechanism. EA blocks pain by activating the descending pain inhibitory system, which originates in the brainstem and terminates at the spinal cord. This review synthesizes corresponding studies to elucidate how EA alleviate pain via the mediation of this descending system. Much emphasis has been put on the implication of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways in the process of pain modulation. Also, other important transmitters and supraspinal regions related to analgesic effects of EA has been demonstrated. Finally, it should be noticed that there exists some shortcomings involved in the animal experimental design for EA, which account for conflicting results obtained by different studies.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00888">Serial Metabolic Evaluation of Perihematomal Tissues in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Pig Model</a></h4>

Purpose
Perihematomal edema (PHE) occurs in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is often used as surrogate of secondary brain injury. PHE resolves over time, but little is known about the functional integrity of the tissues that recover from edema. In a pig ICH model, we aimed to assess metabolic integrity of perihematoma tissues by using noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
Material and Methods
Fourteen male Yorkshire pigs with an average age of 8 weeks were intracerebrally injected with autologous blood to produce ICH. Proton MRS data were obtained at 1, 7, and 14 days after ICH using a whole-body 3.0T MRI system. Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-localized 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) was acquired. The concentration of N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cr) were measured within the area of PHE, tissues adjacent to the injury with no or negligible edema (ATNE), and contralesional brain tissue. A linear mixed model was used to analyze the evolution of metabolites in perihematomal tissues, with p-value &lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance.
Results
The perihematoma volume gradually decreased from 2.38 Â± 1.23 ml to 0.41 Â± 0.780 ml (p &lt; 0.001) over 2 weeks. Significant (p &lt; 0.001) reductions in NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations were found in the PHE and ATNE regions compared to the contralesional hemisphere at day 1 and day 7 after ICH. All three metabolites were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) restored in the PHE tissue on day 14, but remained persistently low in the ATNE area, and unaltered  in the contralesional voxel. 
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential of MRS to probe salvageable tissues within the perihematoma in the sub-acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage. Altered metabolites within the PHE and ATNE regions in addition to edema and hematoma volumes were explored as possible markers for tissue recovery. Perihematomal tissue with PHE demonstrated a more reversible injury compared to the tissue adjacent to the injury without edema, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of edema.

The profile of 122 metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and controls was studied. Among the 122 metabolites analyzed, 62 could be detected. Statistically significant differences between the AD and control group were only detected for metabolites of the glycolysis. Thus, accurate quantification of 11 glycolytic metabolites was done. At this, we detected a significant reduction of five of them, namely phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the AD CSF compared to controls. These results correlate with the known reduction of glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with AD and indicate that metabolic analysis of the central carbon metabolism can be a potential tool in AD diagnostic. Although the ROC analyses of the metabolites do not reach the level of the diagnostic quality of AD biomarkers, the combination of glycolysis metabolites with the established biomarkers led to an improvement in sensitivity and specificity. Thus, metabolic markers could increase diagnostic safety and represent an approach to characterize the progression of the disease.

Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the ordinary methods. Nevertheless, these methods are inapplicable for small datasets, which are very common in medical problems. To this end, we propose a knowledge transfer method between diseases via the Generative Bayesian Prior network. Our approach is compared to a pre-train approach and random initialization and obtains the best results in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient metric for the small subsets of the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 database (BRATS2018).

A significant body of experimental evidence has demonstrated that it is possible to induce the illusion of ownership of a fake limb or even an entire fake body using multisensory correlations. Recently, immersive virtual reality has allowed users to experience the same sensations of ownership over a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment, which in turn allows virtual reality users to have the feeling of being âembodiedâ in a virtual body. Using such virtual embodiment to manipulate body perception is starting to be extensively investigated and may have clinical implications for conditions that involve altered body image such as chronic pain. Here, we review experimental and clinical studies that have explored the manipulation of an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality for both experimental and clinical pain relief. We discuss the current state of the art, as well as the challenges faced by, and ideas for, future research. Finally, we explore the potentialities of using an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality in the field of neurorehabilitation, specifically in the field of pain.

The P2X7 receptor, a member of the ionotropic purinergic P2X family of extracellular ATP-gated receptors, exerts a strong trophic effect when tonically activated in cells, in addition to a cytotoxic role after sustained activation. Because of a widespread distribution, P2X7 regulates several different cell- and tissue-specific physiological functions, and is involved in a number of disease conditions. A novel role has recently emerged for P2X7 in the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism. In previous work, we have demonstrated that genetic depletion, and to a lesser extent also pharmacological inhibition of P2X7, elicits a significant decrease of whole body energy expenditure and an increase of respiratory exchange ratio. In the present work, we have investigated the effects of P2X7 stimulation in vivo on whole body energy metabolism. Adult mice were daily injected with the specific P2X7 agonist 2â²(3â²)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine5â²-triphosphate for one week and subjected to indirect calorimetric analysis for 48 hours. We report that 2â²(3â²)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine5â²-triphosphate increases metabolic rate and O2 consumption, concomitantly decreasing respiratory rate and upregulating NADPH oxidase 2 in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Our results indicate a major impact on energy homeostasis and muscle metabolism by activation of P2X7.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00387">Changes in Activity of Spinal Postural Networks at Different Time Points After Spinalization</a></h4>

Postural limb reflexes (PLRs) are an essential component of postural corrections. Spinalization leads to disappearance of postural functions (including PLRs). After spinalization, spastic, incorrectly-phased motor responses to postural perturbations containing oscillatory EMG bursting gradually develop, suggesting plastic changes in the spinal postural networks. Here, to reveal these plastic changes, rabbits at 3, 7 and 30 days after spinalization at T12 were decerebrated, and responses of spinal interneurons from L5 along with hindlimb muscles EMG responses to postural sensory stimuli, causing PLRs in subjects with intact spinal cord (control), were characterized.
	Like in control and after acute spinalization, at each of three studied time points after spinalization, neurons responding to postural sensory stimuli were found. Proportion of such neurons during first month after spinalization did not reach the control level, and was similar to that observed after acute spinalization. In contrast, their activity (which was significantly decreased after acute spinalization) reached the control value at 3 days after spinalization and remained close to this level during the following month. However, the processing of postural sensory signals, which was severely distorted after acute spinalization, did not recover by 30 days after injury. In addition, we found a significant enhancement of the oscillatory activity in a proportion of the examined neurons, which could contribute to generation of oscillatory EMG bursting.
	Motor responses to postural stimuli (which were almost absent after acute spinalization) re-appeared at 3 days after spinalization, although they were very weak, irregular, and a half of them was incorrectly phased in relation to postural stimuli. Proportion of correct and incorrect motor responses remained almost the same during the following month, but their amplitude gradually increased.
	Thus, spinalization triggers two processes of plastic changes in the spinal postural networks: rapid (taking days) restoration of normal activity level in spinal interneurons, and slow (taking months) recovery of motoneuronal excitability. Most likely, recovery of interneuronal activity underlies re-appearance of motor responses to postural stimuli. However, absence of recovery of normal processing of postural sensory signals and enhancement of oscillatory activity of neurons result in abnormal PLRs and loss of postural functions.

Formation of Tau aggregates is a common pathological feature of tauopathies and their accumulation directly correlates with cytotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. Great efforts have been made to understand Tau aggregation and to find therapeutics halting or reversing the process, however, progress has been slowed due to the lack of a suitable method for monitoring Tau aggregation.
We developed a cell-based assay allowing to detect and quantify Tau aggregation in living cells.
The system is based on the FRET biosensor CST able to monitor the molecular dynamic of Tau aggregation in different cellular conditions. We probed candidate compounds that could block Tau hyperphosphorylation. In particular, to foster the drug discovery process, we tested kinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of other diseases. We identified the ERK inhibitor PD-901 as a promising therapeutic molecule since it reduces and prevents Tau aggregation. This evidence establishes the CST cell-based aggregation assay as a reliable tool for drug discovery and suggests that PD-901 might be a promising compound to be tested for further preclinical studies on AD.

Neurotrophic factors are relevant regulators of the neurogenic process at different levels. In particular, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is highly expressed in the hippocampus (HC) of rodents and participates in the control of neuronal proliferation and survival in the dentate gyrus. Likewise, serotonin is also involved in the regulation of neurogenesis, though its role is apparently more complex. Indeed, both enhancement of serotonin neurotransmission as well as serotonin depletion, paradoxically increase neuronal survival in the HC of mice. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the BDNF isoforms, i.e. pro- and mature-BDNF, and their respective receptors p75 and TrkB, in the HC of mice chronically treated with para-chloro-phenyl-alanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. The same analysis was conducted in hyposerotonergic mice with concomitant administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Increased expression of p75 receptor with decreased expression of pro-BDNF was observed after chronic PCPA. Seven-day treatment with 8-OH-DPAT reestablished the expression of pro-BDNF modified by PCPA, and induced an increase in the expression of p75 receptor. It has been demonstrated that PCPA-treated mice have higher number of immature neurons in the HC. Given that immature neurons participate in the pattern separation process, the object pattern separation test was conducted. A better performance of hyposerotonergic mice was not confirmed in this assay. Altogether, our results show that molecules in the BDNF signaling pathway are differentially expressed under diverse configurations of the serotonergic system, allowing for fine-tuning of the neurogenic process.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00366">Role of C/EBP-Î² in Methamphetamine-Mediated Microglial Apoptosis</a></h4>

Methamphetamine (MA) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that primarily damages the nervous system. However, the involvement of MA in the survival of microglia remains poorly understood. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP-Î²) is a transcription factor and an important regulator of cell apoptosis. Lipocalin2 (lcn2) is a known apoptosis inducer and is involved in many cell death processes. We hypothesized that C/EBP-Î² is involved in MA-induced lcn2-mediated microglial apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we measured the protein expression of C/EBP-Î² after MA treatment and evaluated the effects of silencing C/EBP-Î² or lcn2 on MA-induced apoptosis in BV-2 cells and the mouse striatum after intrastriatal MA injection. MA exposure increased the expression of C/EBP-Î² and stimulated the lcn2-mediated modulation of apoptosis. Moreover, silencing the C/EBP-Î²-dependent lcn2 upregulation reversed the MA-induced microglial apoptosis. The in vivo relevance of these findings was confirmed in  mouse models, which demonstrated that the microinjection of anti-C/EBP-Î² into the striatum ameliorated the MA-induced decrease survival of microglia. These findings provide a new insight regarding the specific contributions of C/EBP-Î²-lcn2 to microglial survival in the context of MA abuse.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00365">The Purinome and the preBÃ¶tzinger Complex â A MÃ©nage of Unexplored Mechanisms That May Modulate/Shape the Hypoxic Ventilatory Response</a></h4>

Exploration of purinergic signaling in brainstem homeostatic control processes is challenging the traditional view that the biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response, which comprises a rapid initial increase in breathing followed by a slower secondary depression, reflects the interaction between peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated excitation and central inhibition. While controversial, accumulating evidence supports that in addition to peripheral excitation, interactions between central excitatory and inhibitory purinergic mechanisms shape this key homeostatic reflex. The objective of this review is to present our working model of how purinergic signaling modulates the glutamatergic inspiratory synapse in the preBÃ¶tzinger Complex (key site of inspiratory rhythm generation) to shape the hypoxic ventilatory response. It is based on the perspective that has emerged from decades of analysis of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, where the actions of extracellular ATP are determined by a complex signaling system, the purinome, that involves not only the actions of ATP and adenosine at P2 and P1 receptors, respectively, but diverse families of enzymes and transporters that collectively determine the rate of ATP degradation, adenosine accumulation and adenosine clearance. We summarize current knowledge of the roles played by these different purinergic elements in the hypoxic ventilatory response, often drawing on examples from other brain regions, and look ahead to many unanswered questions and remaining challenges.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00223">Sensory Stimulation-Induced Astrocytic Calcium Signaling in Electrically Silent Ischemic Penumbra</a></h4>

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces ischemia characterized by a densely ischemic focus, and a less densely ischemic penumbral zone in which neurons and astrocytes display age-dependent dynamic variations in spontaneous Ca2+ activities. However, it is unknown whether penumbral nerve cells respond to sensory stimulation early after stroke onset, which is critical for understanding stimulation-induced stroke therapy. In this study, we investigated the ischemic penumbraâs capacity to respond to somatosensory input.  We examined adult (3- to 4-month-old) and old (18- to 24-month-old) male mice at 2â4 hours after MCAO, using two-photon microscopy to record somatosensory stimulation-induced neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the ischemic penumbra. In both adult and old mice, MCAO abolished spontaneous and stimulation-induced electrical activity in the penumbra, and strongly reduced stimulation-induced Ca2+ responses in neuronal somas (35â82%) and neuropil (92â100%) in the penumbra. In comparison, after stroke, stimulation-induced astrocytic Ca2+ responses in the penumbra were only moderately reduced (by 54â62%) in adult mice, and were even better preserved (reduced by 31â38%) in old mice. 
Our results suggest that somatosensory stimulation evokes astrocytic Ca2+ activity in the ischemic penumbra. We hypothesize that the relatively preserved excitability of astrocytes, most prominent in aged mice, may modulate protection from ischemic infarcts during early somatosensory activation of an ischemic cortical area. Future neuroprotective efforts in stroke may target spontaneous or stimulation-induced activity of astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra.

Although subtle discourse declines in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been reported, heterogeneous measures and tasks among the MCI discourse studies have yielded widely varying outcomes. The present study aimed to first, identify discourse measures that aid the differentiation among people with amnestic MCI (aMCI), people with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), and cognitively healthy control (HC) participants, and second, delineate the cognitive functions related to such discourse measures. Three discourse tasks (an episodic narrative, a planning task, and a picture description) were performed by 30 aMCI, 22 naMCI, and 21 HC participants. Samples were analyzed using six categories of 15 measures, namely coherence, cohesion, proposition, grammaticality, lexicality, and fluency. The statistical analyses included 1) a multivariate analysis of variance for group comparison; 2) binary simple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for differentiation between two groups; 3) binary multiple logistic regression for being diagnosed with naMCI or aMCI with the minimum number of predictors; and 4) Pearson correlation analysis for identifying the cognitive functions associated with the discourse measures. The proportion of cohesive words and propositional density in aMCI participants were worse than those in naMCI participants. Global coherence, the proportion of cohesive words, and the proportion of dysfluencies and pauses in naMCI participants were lower than those in the HC participants. Global and local coherence and the proportion of cohesive words, cohesive ties per utterances, propositional density, and dysfluencies and pauses in aMCI participants were worse than those in the HC participants. The aforementioned measures were demonstrated to be effective predictors for classifying groups by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In addition, the proportions of cohesive words and pauses were common discourse measures for differentiation between naMCI and HC participants or between aMCI and HC participants using binary multiple logistic regression. According to the correlation analysis, memory and executive functions are needed for coherent, cohesive, and efficient discourse productions in MCI. The detailed description of discourse performances in this study will aid the characterization of the declined language abilities of MCI participants and also the understanding of the cognitive functions involved in discourse performance in MCI.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00219">Speech Comprehension and Its Relation to Other Auditory Parameters in Elderly Patients With Tinnitus</a></h4>

Deteriorated speech comprehension is a common manifestation of the age-related decline of auditory functions (presbycusis). It could be assumed that when presbycusis is accompanied by tinnitus, general hearing functions, and particularly comprehension of speech in quiet and speech in noise, will be significantly affected. In this study, speech comprehension ability and other parameters of auditory function were assessed in elderly subjects with (T, n=25) and without (NT, n=26) tinnitus, aiming for examination of both peripheral and central auditory processing, Apart from high-frequency audiograms in quiet and in background noise, speech recognition thresholds in silence or in competitive babble noise, and the ability to understand temporally gated speech, we measured also sensitivity to frequency modulation  and interaural delay, gap detection thresholds, or the difference limens of intensity. The results show that in elderly participants matched by age (mean ages around 68 years), cognitive status (median MoCA scores around 27), and hearing thresholds (median pure-tone averages around 16 dB HL), tinnitus per se has little influence on speech comprehension. The tinnitus patients also show similar gap-detection thresholds, sensitivity to interaural intensity difference, and sensitivity to frequency modulation as the NT subjects. Despite these similarities, nevertheless, significant differences in auditory processing have been found in the tinnitus participants: a worse ability to detect tones in noise, a higher sensitivity to intensity changes, and a higher sensitivity to interaural time differences. Additional correlation analyses further revealed that speech comprehension in the T subjects is dependent on the sensitivity to temporal modulation and interaural time delay, while these correlations are weak and non-significant in the NT subjects. Therefore, despite similarities in average speech comprehension and several other parameters of auditory function, elderly people with tinnitus exhibit different auditory processing, particularly at suprathreshold level. The results also suggest that speech comprehension ability of elderly tinnitus patients relies more on temporal features of the sound stimuli, especially under difficult conditions, compared to elderly people without tinnitus.

Synaptic computation is believed to underlie many forms of animal behaviour. A correct identification of synaptic transmission properties is thus crucial for a better understanding of how the brain processes information, stores memories and learns. Recently, a number of new statistical methods for inferring synaptic transmission parameters have been introduced. Here we review and contrast these developments, with a focus on methods aimed at inferring both synaptic release statistics and synaptic dynamics. Furthermore, based on recent proposals we discuss how such methods can be applied to data across different levels of investigation: from intracellular paired recordings to in vivo network-wide recordings. Overall, these developments open the window to reliably estimating synaptic parameters in behaving animals.

Viral vectors have become very popular to overexpress or downregulate proteins of interest in different cell types. They conveniently allow the precise targeting of well-defined tissue areas, which is particularly useful in complex organs like the brain. In theory, each vector should have its own cell specificity that can be obtained by using different strategies (e.g. using a cell-specific promoter). For the moment, there is few vectors that have been developed to alternatively target, using the same capsid, neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system. There is even fewer examples of adeno-associated viral vectors able to efficiently transduce cells both in vitro and in vivo. The development of viral vectors allowing the cell-specific downregulation of a protein in cultured cells of the central nervous system as well as in vivo within a large brain area would be highly desirable to address several important questions in neurobiology. Here we report that the use of the AAV2/DJ viral vector associated to an hybrid CMV/chicken Î²-actin promoter (CBA) or to a modified form of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (G1B3) allows a specific transduction of neurons or astrocytes in more than half of the barrel field within the rat somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the use of the miR30E-shRNA technology led to an efficient downregulation of two proteins of interest related to metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to downregulate the expression of different protein isoforms in a cell-specific manner using a common serotype. It is proposed that such an approach could be extended to other cell types and used to target several proteins of interest within the same brain area.

Hyperglycemia, a key characteristic and risk factor for diabetes mellitus (DM), causes neuronal senescence. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel neuroprotectant. The present work was to investigate the potential effect of H2S on hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and the underlying mechanisms. We found that NaHS, a donor of H2S, inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced cellular senescence in HT22 cells (an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line), as evidenced by decrease in the number of SA-Î²-gal positive cells, increase in the cells growth, and down-regulations of senescence mark proteins, p16INK4a and p21CIP1. NaHS improved the autophagic flux, which is judged by decrease in the amount of intracellular autophagosome as well as up-regulations of LC3II/I and P62 in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, blocked autophagic flux by chloroquine (CQ) significantly abolished NaHS-exerted improvement in the autophagic flux and suppression in the cellular senescence of GH-exposed HT22 cells, which indicated that H2S antagonizes HG-induced neuronal senescence by promoting autophagic flux. We also found that NaHS up-regulated the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an important anti-aging protein, in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reversed the protection of H2S against HG-induced autophagic flux blockade and cellular senescence in HT22 cells. These data indicated that H2S protects HT22 cells against HG-induced cellular senescence by improving autophagic flux via up-regulation of SIRT1, suggesting H2S as a potential treatment strategy for hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and neurotoxicity.

Blindness is an ideal condition to study the role of visual input on the development of spatial representation. Studies have shown how audio space representation reorganizes in blindness. However, how spatial reorganization works is still unclear. A limit of the study on blindness is that it is a âstableâ system and it does not allow studying the mechanisms that subtend the progress of this reorganization. To overcome this problem here we study, for the first time, audio spatial reorganization in 18 adults with Macular Degeneration for which the loss of vision due to scotoma is an ongoing progressive process. Our results show that the loss of vision produces immediate changes in the processing of spatial audio signals. In individuals with Macular Degeneration, the lateral sounds are âattractedâ towards the central scotoma position resulting in a strong bias in the spatial auditory percept. This result suggests that the reorganization of audio space representation is a fast and plastic process occurring also later in life, after vision loss.

Learning and memorizing sequences of events is an important function of the human brain and the basis for forming expectations and making predictions. Learning is facilitated by repeating a sequence several times, causing rhythmic appearance of the individual sequence elements. This observation invites to consider the resulting multitude of rhythms as a spectral `fingerprint' which characterizes the respective sequence. Here we explore the implications of this perspective by developing a neurobiologically plausible computational model which captures this `fingerprint' by attuning an ensemble of neural oscillators. In our model, this attuning process is based on a number of oscillatory phenomena that have been observed in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity like synchronization, phase locking and reset as well as cross-frequency coupling. We compare the learning properties of the model with behavioral results from a study in human participants and observe good agreement of the errors for different levels of complexity of the sequence to be memorized. Finally, we suggest an extension of the model for processing sequences that extend over several sensory modalities.

Animal communication plays an essential role in triggering diverse behaviors. It is believed in this regard that signal production by a sender and its perception by a receiver is co-evolving in order to have beneficial effects such as to ensure that conspecifics remain sensitive to these signals. However, in order to give appropriate responses to a communication signal, the receiver has to first detect and interpret it in a meaningful way. The detection of communication signals can be limited under some circumstances, for example when the signal is masked by the background noise in which it occurs (e.g., the cocktail-party problem). Moreover, some signals are very alike despite having different meanings making it hard to discriminate between them. How the central nervous system copes with these tasks and problems is a central question in systems neuroscience. Gymnotiform weakly electric fish pose an interesting system to answer these questions for various reasons: 1) they use a variety of communication signals called âchirpsâ during different behavioral encounters; 2) the central physiology of the electrosensory system is well known; 3) most importantly, these fish give reliable behavioral responses to artificial stimuli that resemble natural communication signals, making it possible to uncover the neural mechanisms that lead to the observed behaviors.

Humans and animals can learn to order a list of items without relying on explicit spatial or temporal cues. To do so, they appear to make use of transitivity, a property of all ordered sets. Here, we summarize relevant research on the transitive inference (TI) paradigm and its relationship to learning the underlying order of an arbitrary set of items. We compare six computational models of TI performance, three of which are model-free (Q-learning, Value Transfer, and REMERGE) and three of which are model-based (RL-Elo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Betasort). Our goal is to assess the ability of these models to produce empirically observed features of TI behavior. Model-based approaches perform better under a wider range of scenarios, but no single model explains the full scope of behaviors reported in the TI literature.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that mainly exists in the nervous system. It plays a neuroprotective role in organisms and widely participates in the regulation of various physiological processes in vivo. Studies in both humans and animal models have been revealed that NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders. NPY plays various roles in these diseases, such as exerting a neuroprotective effect, increasing trophic support, decreasing excitotoxicity, regulating calcium homeostasis, and attenuating neuroinflammation. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, highlighting NPY as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.

Cessation of blood flow leads to a complex cascade of pathophysiological events at the blood-vascular-parenchymal interface which evolves over time and space, and results in damage to neural cells and edema formation. Cerebral ischemic injury evokes a profound and deleterious upregulation in inflammation and triggers multiple cell death pathways, but it also induces a series of the events associated with regenerative responses, including vascular remodeling, angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic reprograming could play a pivotal role in ongoing post-stroke neurovascular unit changes and recovery. This review summarizes current knowledge about post-stroke recovery processes at the neurovascular unit, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and modifiers (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifying enzymes and microRNAs) associated with stroke injury and neurovascular unit repair. It also discusses novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies for enhancing post-stroke recovery.

Objectives: Effects of resveratrol on autophagy in frontal cortex and hippocampus of CCH model rats were observed, and neuroprotective effects of resveratrol on CCH rats and the mechanism of action of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were researched. Method: The CCH model was made by permanently ligating the bilateral common carotid arteries. Neurological deficit scores and Morris water maze test were used to test the behavioral changes and the cognitive function of rats; HE and Tunel staining were used to detect pathological and neuronal apoptosis in frontal cortex and hippocampus. ELISA was used to detect oxidative stress factor and brain injury markers. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to detect the expression of apoptosis, autophagy and AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Results: After resveratrol treatment, the neurological function scores of CCH rats were reduced, cognitive dysfunction caused by long-term hypoxia and hypoperfusion was improved, and the pathological damage in frontal cortex and hippocampus was reduced; The expression of oxidative stress and brain injury markers decreased the apoptotic rate of neurons in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The resveratrol can activate autophagy and inhibit the expression of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins. PI3K inhibitor reversed the protective effect of resveratrol. Conclusions: The resveratrol can improve the cognitive function damage of CCH model rats, and reduce the damage of oxidative stress on neurons in frontal cortex and hippocampus by activating autophagy and inhibit neuronal apoptosis. This effect may be regulated by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other.  To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it 1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, 2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and 3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined.  Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level.  We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.

Herein, this study was carried out to assess the possible modulatory role of low-frequency pulsed magnetic field (LFPMF) on reversing cognitive impairment in a model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups as follow: a control group (CON), a control applied with LFPMF (CON+LFPMF), a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and a CUS treated with LFPMF (CUS+LFPMF). During 8 weeks of CUS, comparing to those in CON group animals not only gained less weight, but also exhibited anhedonia, anxiety, and cognitive decline in behavioral tests. After two-week treatment of LFPMF, a 20mT, 1Hz magnetic stimulation, it reversed the impairment of spatial cognition as well as hippocampal synaptic function including long-term potentiation and related protein expression. Thus, LFPMF has shown effectively improvements on depressant behavior and cognitive dysfunction in CUS rats, possibly via regulating synaptic function.

3 Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalised neuromodulation
4 which usually incorporates recording of some biomarker, followed by implementation of an
5 algorithm which decides the timing (when ?) and strength (how much ?) of stimulation.
6 Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open loop
7 neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy,
8 movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug
9 addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably
10 neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for
11 various neurological disorders as well as provide deeper insight into neurological mechanisms.
12 The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K+), sodium
13 (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Clô), hydrogen (H+) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine,
14 serotonin, glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a
15 neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system such as biomarkers, sensors and data
16 processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and demerits of using this
17 biomarker modality.

Objective: The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with the processing of negative emotions. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. We aimed to determine the changes in GABA levels in the ACC of perimenopausal women with depression. Methods: We recruited 120 perimenopausal women, who were followed up for 18â24 months. After reaching menopause, the participants were divided into a control group (n = 71), an anxiety group (n = 30), and a depression group (n = 19). The participants were examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). TARQUIN software was used to calculate the GABA concentrations in the ACC before and after menopause. The relationship of the GABA levels with the patientsâ scores on the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale was determined. Results: GABA decreased with time. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower than the premenopausal levels in the normal, anxiety, and depression groups (P = 0.014, &lt;0.001, and &lt;0.001, respectively). The premenopausal GABA levels did not significantly differ between the normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.907), normal vs. depression group (P = 0.495), and anxiety vs. depression group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group, normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.022), normal vs. depression group (P &lt; 0.001), and anxiety vs. depression group (P = 0.047).
Conclusion: Changes in GABA concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex are related with the pathophysiological mechanism and symptoms of perimenopausal depression.

The brainâs ability to extract three-dimensional (3D) shape and orientation information from viewed objects is vital in daily life. Stereoscopic 3D surface perception relies on binocular disparity. Neurons selective to binocular disparity are widely distributed among visual areas, but the manner in these areas are involved in stereoscopic 3D surface representation is unclear. To address this, participants were instructed to observe random dot stereograms depicting convex and concave curved surfaces and the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal of visual cortices was recorded. Two surface types were (i) horizontally positioned surfaces defined by shear disparity and (ii) vertically positioned surfaces defined by compression disparity. The surfaces were presented at different depth positions per trial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were classified from early visual areas to higher visual areas. We determined whether cortical areas were selective to shape and orientation by assessing same-type stimuli classification accuracies based on multi-voxel activity patterns per area. To identify whether some areas were related to a more generalized sign of curvature or orientation representation, transfer classification was used by training classifiers on one dataset type and testing classifiers on another type. Same-type stimuli classification results showed that most selected visual areas were selective to shape and all were selective to the orientation of disparity-defined 3D surfaces. Transfer classification results showed that in the dorsal visual area V3A, classification accuracies for the discriminate sign of surface curvature were higher than the baseline of statistical significance for all types of classifications, demonstrating that V3A is related to generalized shape representation. Classification accuracies for discriminating horizontalâvertical surfaces in higher dorsal areas V3A and V7 and ventral area lateral occipital complex as well as in some areas of intraparietal sulcus were higher than the baseline of statistical significance, indicating their relation to the generalized representation of 3D surface orientation.

Emotional recognition through EEG signals is becoming increasingly popular. However, It has been difficult to improve the emotional recognition effect of cross-subjects. In the exploration of cross-subjects proposed in previous works, the effect of the two-category cross-subject emotion recognition should be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method for improving the accuracy of binary classification emotion and the program runs faster. In response to this difficulty and the defects of related works in the past. We extracted multiple features to form high-dimensional features, and proposed a binary classification cross-subject emotion recognition method based on high-dimensional features, the Significance Test, the Sequential Backward Selection and Support Vector Machine fusion method (ST-SBSSVM). The effectiveness of the ST-SBSSVM was validated on a dataset (DEAP) using physiological signals for emotion analysis and an electroencephalogram dataset (SEED) using SJTU emotions. Results by using ST-SBSSVM have shown that in the case of high-dimensional features, ST-SBSSVM had an average of about 8% (DEAP) and 32% (SEED) improvement in the accuracy of cross-subject emotions compared with common emotion recognition methods. ST-SBSSVM improved the recognition accuracy of cross-subjects by 2% (DEAP) and 12% (SEED) and saved about 95% (DEAP) and 93% (SEED) of program runtime compared to the Sequential Backward Selection. Compared with recent similar works, the effect of this work on the emotion recognition of cross-subjects was obvious, and the accuracy of this work was 68% (DEAP) and 91% (SEED). After using ST-SBSSVM, we also found that nonlinear EEG features can promote emotion recognition more than linear EEG features.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00081">Three-Dimensional Segmentation and Reconstruction of Neuronal Nuclei in Confocal Microscopic Images</a></h4>

The detailed architectural examination of the neuronal nuclei in any brain region, using confocal microscopy, requires quantification of fluorescent signals in three-dimensional stacks of confocal images. An essential prerequisite to any quantification is the segmentation of the nuclei which are typically tightly packed in the tissue, the extreme being the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), in which nuclei frequently appear to overlap due to limitations in microscope resolution. Segmentation in DG is a challenging task due to the presence of a significant amount of image artifacts and densely packed nuclei. Accordingly, we established an algorithm based on continuous boundary tracing criterion aiming to reconstruct the nucleus surface and to separate the adjacent nuclei. The presented algorithm neither uses a pre-built nucleus model, nor performs image thresholding, which makes it robust against variations in image intensity and poor contrast. Further, the reconstructed surface is used to study morphology and spatial arrangement of the nuclear interior. The presented method is generally dedicated to segmentation of crowded, overlapping objects in 3D space. In particular, it allows us to study quantitatively the architecture of the neuronal nucleus using confocal-microscopic approach.

Human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a large potential for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived human astrocyte and neuronal cultures permit investigations of neural signal-ing pathways with subcellular resolution. Combinatorial cultures, and three-dimensional (3-D) embryonic bodies enlarge the scope of investigations to multi-cellular phenomena. A the highest level of complexity, brain organoids that â in many aspects â recapitulate anatomical and functional features of the developing brain permit the study of developmental and morphological aspects of human disease. An ideal microscope for 3-D tissue imaging at these different scales would combine features from both confocal laser-scanning and light-sheet microscopes: a micrometric optical sectioning capacity and sub-micrometric spatial re-solution, a large field of view and high frame rate, and a low degree of invasiveness, i.e., ideally, a better photon efficiency than that of a confocal microscope. In the present work, we describe such an instrument that uses planar two-photon (2P) excitation. Its particularity is that â unlike two- or three-lens light-sheet microscopes â it uses a single, low-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective for the generation and scanning of a virtual light sheet. The microscope builds on a modified Nipkow-PetrÃ¡Å spinning-disk scheme for achieving wide-field excitation. However, unlike the Yokogawa design that uses a tandem disk, our concept combines micro lenses, dichroic mirrors and detection pinholes on a single disk. This new design, advantageous for 2P excitation, circumvents problems arising with the tandem disk from the large wavelength-difference between the infrared excitation light and visible fluorescence. 2P fluorescence excited by the light sheet is collected with the same objective and imaged onto a fast sCMOS camera. We demonstrate 3-D imaging of TO-PRO3-stained embryonic bodies and of brain organoids, uncleared and after rapid partial transparisation with triethanolamine formamide (RTF) and we compare the performance of our instrument to that of a confocal laser-scanning microscope having a similar numerical aperture. Our large-field 2P-spinning disk microscope permits one order of magnitude faster imaging, affords less photobleaching and permits better depth penetration than a confocal microscope with similar spatial resolution.

Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without preprocessing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as âomics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) patients are known to have heterogeneous clinical presentation and pathologic patterns. We hypothesize that AD dementia can be categorized into subtypes based on multimodal imaging biomarkers such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau positron emission tomography (PET), and amyloid PET. We collected 3T MRI, 18F-THK5351 PET, and 18F-flutemetamol (FLUTE) PET data from 83 patients with AD dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating â¤ 1) and 60 normal controls (NC), and applied surface-based analyses to measure cortical thickness, THK5351 SUVR and FLUTE SUVR for each participant. For the patient group, we performed an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis using the three multimodal imaging features on the vertices (n = 3 Ã 79,950). The identified AD subtypes were compared to NC using general linear models adjusting for age, sex, and years of education. We mapped the effect size within significant cortical regions reaching a corrected p-vertex &lt; 0.05 (random field theory). Our surface-based multimodal framework has revealed three distinct subtypes among AD patients: medial temporal-dominant subtype (MT, n = 44), parietal-dominant subtype (P, n = 19), and diffuse atrophy subtype (D, n = 20). The topography of cortical atrophy and THK5351 retention differentiates between the three subtypes. In the case of FLUTE, three subtypes did not show distinct topographical differences, although cortical composite retention was significantly higher in the P type than in the MT type. These three subtypes also differed in demographic and clinical features. In conclusion, AD patients may be clustered into three subtypes with distinct topographical features of cortical atrophy and tau deposition, although amyloid deposition may not differ across the subtypes in terms of topography.

Inhibitory control matures through adolescence and into early adulthood, impacting decision-making. Impairments in inhibitory control are associated with various psychopathologies, many of which emerge during adolescence. In this review, we examine the neural basis of developmental improvements in inhibitory control by integrating findings from humans and non-human primates, identifying the structural and functional specialization of executive brain systems that mediates cognitive maturation. Behavioral manifestations of response inhibition suggest that adolescents are capable of producing adult level responses on occasion, but lack the ability to engage systems mediating response inhibition in a consistent fashion.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and although its etiology remains unclear, it seems that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other prediabetic states of insulin resistance could contribute to the appearance of sporadic AD. As such, we have assessed whether tau and Î²âamyloid (AÎ²) deposits might be present in pancreatic tissue of subjects with AD, and whether amylin, an amyloidogenic protein deposited in the pancreas of T2DM patients, might accumulate in the brain of AD patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied pancreatic and brain tissue from 48 individuals with no neuropathological alterations and from 87 subjects diagnosed with AD. We examined AÎ² and tau accumulation in the pancreas as well as that of amylin in the brain. Moreover, we performed proximity ligation assays to ascertain whether tau and/or AÎ² interact with amylin in either the pancreas or brain of these subjects.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cytoplasmic tau and AÎ² protein deposits were detected in pancreatic Î² cells of subjects with AD as well as in subjects with a normal neuropathological examination but with a history of T2DM and in a small cohort of control subjects without T2DM. Furthermore, we found amylin deposits in the brain of these subjects, providing histological evidence that amylin can interact with AÎ² and tau in both the pancreas and hippocampus.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The presence of both tau and AÎ² inclusions in pancreatic Î² cells, and of amylin deposits in the brain, provides new evidence of a potential overlap in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of T2DM and AD. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25562?af=R">Early AÎ² reduction prevents progression of cerebral amyloid angiopathy</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical trials targeting Î²âamyloid peptides (AÎ²) for Alzheimer disease (AD) failed for arguable reasons that include selecting the wrong stages of AD pathophysiology or AÎ² being the wrong target. Targeting AÎ² to prevent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has not been rigorously followed, although the causal role of AÎ² for CAA and related hemorrhages is undisputed. CAA occurs with normal aging and to various degrees in AD, where its impact and treatment is confounded by the presence of parenchymal AÎ² deposition.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APPDutch mice develop CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid, mimicking hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWAâD). Mice were treated with a Î²âsite amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor. We used 3âdimensional ultramicroscopy and immunoassays for visualizing CAA and assessing AÎ² in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CAA onset in mice was at 22 to 24 months, first in frontal leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels followed by vessels penetrating the cortical layers. CSF AÎ² increased with aging followed by a decrease of both AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 upon CAA onset, supporting the idea that combined reduction of CSF AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 is a specific biomarker for vascular amyloid. BACE1 inhibitor treatment starting at CAA onset and continuing for 4 months revealed a 90% AÎ² reduction in CSF and largely prevented CAA progression and associated pathologies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study showing that AÎ² reduction at early disease time points largely prevents CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid. Our observation provides a preclinical basis for AÎ²âreducing treatments in patients at risk of CAA and in presymptomatic HCHWAâD. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

OBJECTIVEï¼ To assist clinicians to operate repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) precisely based on the coil magnetic field spatial distribution with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Navigation.
METHODS: A fast method for calculating electromagnetic fields in layered brain structures in frequency domain was proposed. By approaching Bessel function in different intervals, the integral with a highly oscillatory kernel was transformed into two parts: a definite integral and a weakened oscillatory one. The distribution of induced current density and magnetic field intensity of rTMS stimulation effect on brain was quantitatively calculated, so that clinicians could intuitively grasp the safe range of coil stimulation on brain. Then, the crucial factor of the stimulation effect of rTMS was determined, and an accurate coil positioning of the rTMS efficiently was completed.            
Result: The maximal attenuation of induced electric field and magnetic induction intensity was 72.20% and 86.867% at 3 cm away from the skin in the brain layered model. The clinical examination results of electric field intensity distribution, magnetic field intensity distribution, current density distribution, layered brain modeling and coil location speed in the brain model teaching group were significantly higher than those in the traditional teaching group (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: It is suitable for clinicians to quickly complete the precise positioning of rTMS, master the adjustment of coil stimulation therapeutic parameters, and realize the precise positioning operation of rTMS with MRI navigation in intracranial.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have only investigated age-related differences in emotional processing and encoding in response to, not in anticipation of, emotional stimuli. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the âpositivity effectâ seen in older adultsâ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.</span>

Understanding the molecular function of MeCP2 will not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of MeCP2-related disorders, but will also shed light on the epigenetic regulation of neuronal function. In the past few years, a number of studies have provided mechanistic evidence that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes to particular sequences of methylated DNA. Additionally, innovative design and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to study the effects of MeCP2 on the neuronal transcriptome at an unprecedented level of detail, demonstrating that MeCP2 modulates gene expression in a context-specific manner. These findings have raised new questions and challenged current models of MeCP2 function. In this review, we describe several recent developments, highlight future challenges, and articulate a model by which MeCP2 functions as an organizer of chromatin architecture to modulate global gene expression in the nervous system.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: October 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58</p><p>Author(s): Matthew R Whiteway, Daniel A Butts</p><div><p>Many aspects of brain function arise from the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons. Recent developments in neural recording technologies are providing unprecedented access to the activity of such populations during increasingly complex experimental contexts; however, extracting scientific insights from such recordings requires the concurrent development of analytical tools that relate this population activity to system-level function. This is a primary motivation for latent variable models, which seek to provide a low-dimensional description of population activity that can be related to experimentally controlled variables, as well as uncontrolled variables such as internal states (e.g. attention and arousal) and elements of behavior.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure lowering, neurosurgery, and access to critical care might all be beneficial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We combined and implemented these as the âABCâ hyperacute care bundle and sought to determine whether the implementation was associated with lower case fatality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The ABC bundle was implemented from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Key process targets were set, and a registry captured consecutive patients. We compared 30âday case fatality before, during, and after bundle implementation with multivariate logistic regression and used mediation analysis to determine which care process measures mediated any association. Differenceâinâdifference analysis compared 30âday case fatality with 32,295 patients with ICH from 214 other hospitals in England and Wales using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 973 ICH patients were admitted in the study period.

Cystatin B (CSTB) is a ubiquitous protein belonging to a superfamily of protease inhibitors. CSTB may play critical role in brain physiology because its mutations cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy-1A (EPM1A), the most common form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CSTB role in the Central Nervous System (CNS) are largely unknown. To investigate the possible involvement of CSTB in the synaptic plasticity, we analyzed its expression in synaptosomes as model system in studying the physiology of the synaptic regions of the CNS. We found that CSTB is not only present in the synaptosomes isolated from rat and mouse brain cortex, but also secreted into the medium in a depolarization-controlled manner. In addition, using BONCAT (biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging) procedure, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CSTB is locally synthesized in the synaptosomes. The synaptic localization of CSTB was confirmed in a human 3D model of cortical development, namely cerebral organoids. Altogether these results suggest that CSTB may play a role in the brain plasticity and open a new perspective in studying the involvement of CSTB deregulation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.

Recently, we reported that ALWPs, which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler, regulates the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescues LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimerâs disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5ÃFAD mice (a mouse model of AD). Here, we found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5ÃFAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid beta (Abeta) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition, ALWP administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5ÃFAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5ÃFAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly, ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic/cognitive function.

The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinsonâs Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically assessed.

Sustained inflammation in the injured cortex is a promising therapeutic target for disease-modification after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its extent and dynamics of expansion are incompletely understood which challenges the timing and placement of therapeutics to lesioned area. Our aim was to characterize the evolution of chronic inflammation during lesion expansion in lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) rat model with focus on the MRI-negative perilesional cortex. T2-weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injury. End-point histology, including Nissl for neuronal death, GFAP for astrogliosis, and Prussian Blue for iron were used to assess perilesional histopathology. An additional animal cohort was imaged with a positron emission tomography (PET) using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radiotracer [18F]-FEPPA. T2w MRI assessed lesion growth and detected chronic inflammation along the lesion border while rest of the ipsilateral cortex was MRI-negative (MRI-). Instead, myoinositol that is an inflammatory MRS marker for gliosis, glutathione for oxidative stress, and choline for membrane turnover were elevated throughout the 6-months follow-up in the MRI- perilesional cortex (all p &lt; 0.05). MRS markers revealed chronically sustained inflammation across the ipsilateral cortex but did not indicate the upcoming lesion expansion. Instead, the rostral expansion of the cortical lesion was systematically preceded by a hyperintense band in T2w images months earlier. Histologic analysis of the hyperintensity indicated scattered astrocytes, incomplete glial scar, and intracellularly packed and free iron. Yet, the band was negative in [18F]-FEPPA-PET. [18F]-FEPPA also showed no cortical TSPO expression within the MRS voxel in MRI- perilesional cortex or anywhere along glial scar when assessed at 2 months post-injury. However, [18F]-FEPPA showed a robust signal increase, indicating reactive microgliosis in the ipsilateral thalamus at 2 months post-TBI. We present evidence that MRS reveals chronic posttraumatic inflammation in MRI-negative perilesional cortex. The mismatch in MRS, MRI and PET measures may allow noninvasive endophenotyping of beneficial and detrimental inflammatory processes to aid targeting and timing of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.

Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients' overall survival are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation, we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction, we extract 4524 radiomic features from segmented tumor region. Then decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally, a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. On 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS), our method ranks at second place and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams on survival prediction task and segmentation task respectively, achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on classification of short-survivors, mid-survivors and long-survivors.

The elite sports environment provides a unique setting for studying human performance, where both cognitive and physical demands are high. Successful performance in sport is contingent upon key cognitive skills such as attention, perception, working memory and decision-making. The demands of competitive sport also increase loading on the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) offer the potential to investigate the cognitive demands of sport, neuroplasticity of athletes, and biofeedback training. However, practical and technical limitations of these methods have generally limited their use to laboratory-based studies of athletes during simulated sporting tasks. This review provides a brief overview of research that has applied neuroimaging technology to study various aspects of cognitive function during sports performance in athletes, alternative methods for measuring CNS loading (e.g., direct current potential), possible solutions and avenues of focus for future neuroergonomics research in sport.

Background: It has been argued that prosocial behaviors and momentary rewards activate the similar reward systems. However, a recent theoretical hypothesis encourages a fundamentally different view. Specifically, the social heuristic hypothesis posits that individuals internalize prosocial behaviors that are advantageous in their daily social life. These advantageous behaviors are fundamentally different from tangible and immediate reward. 
Objectives: Our objectives are to test a hypothesis that these advantageous prosocial behaviors are so critical to survival that it is necessary to have a neural system in the brain that leads people to maintain repeated social interactions. These neural systems are different from the computations of rewards because prosocial behaviors are not advantageous if only considering the computations of rewards.
Methods: To deepen the understanding of the neural systems of prosocial behaviors and reward, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to examine brain activation in prosocial behaviors and reward tasks.
Results: Prosocial behaviors specifically activated distinct brain systems to a greater degree than reward. These systems were implicated in the processing of social behaviors and included the insula, temporal lobe and superior temporal gyrus. By contrast, reward specifically activated the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex, which are associated with the brain reward system. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors are different from reward and involve specific brain mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is a significant public health concern in older adults. Identifying new ways to maintain cognitive and brain health throughout the lifespan is of utmost importance. Simultaneous exercise and cognitive engagement has been shown to enhance brain function in animal and human studies. Virtual reality (VR) may be a promising approach for conducting simultaneous exercise and cognitive studies. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of cycling in a cognitively enriched and immersive spatial navigation VR environment in younger and older adults.

METHODS: 20 younger (25.9Â±3.7 years) and 20 older (63.6Â±5.6 years) adults participated in this study. Participants completed four trials (2 learning, 2 recall) of cycling while wearing a head-mounted device and navigating a VR park environment. Questionnaires were administered to assess adverse effects, mood, presence, and physical exertion levels associated with cycling in the VR environment.

RESULTS: 4 subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse effects, yielding a 90% completion rate. Simulator sickness levels were enhanced in both age groups with exposure to the VR environment but were within an acceptable range. Exposure to the virtual environment was associated with high arousal and low stress levels, suggesting a state of excitement, and most participants reported enjoyment of the spatial navigation task and VR environment. No association was found between physical exertion levels and simulator sickness levels. 

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that spatial navigation while cycling is feasible and that older adults report similar experiences to younger adults. VR may be a powerful tool for engaging physical and cognitive activity in older adults with acceptable adverse effects and with reports of enjoyment. Future studies are needed to assess the efficacy of a combined exercise and cognitive VR program as an intervention for promoting healthy brain aging, especially in older adults with increased risk of age-related cognitive decline.

We propose that beyond the well-known spatiotemporal filtering of their inputs, dendrites are capable of selecting, routing and multiplexing information. By separating dendritic processing from axonal outputs, neuron networks gain a degree of freedom with implications for perception and learning.</p></div>

General anesthesia reversibly alters consciousness, without shutting down the brain globally. Depending on the anesthetic agent and dose, it may produce different consciousness states including a complete absence of subjective experience (unconsciousness), a conscious experience without perception of the environment (disconnected consciousness, like during dreaming), or episodes of oriented consciousness with awareness of the environment (connected consciousness). Each consciousness state may potentially be followed by explicit or implicit memories after the procedure. In this respect, anesthesia can be considered as a proxy to explore consciousness. During the recent years, progress in the exploration of brain function has allowed a better understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, and of their alterations during anesthesia. Several changes in functional and effective between-region brain connectivity, consciousness network topology, and spatio-temporal dynamics of between-region interactions have been evidenced during anesthesia. Despite a set of effects that are common to many anesthetic agents, it is still uneasy to draw a comprehensive picture of the precise cascades during general anesthesia. Several questions remain unsolved, including the exact identification of the neural substrate of consciousness and its components, the detection of specific consciousness states in unresponsive patients and their associated memory processes, the processing of sensory information during anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic interactions between anesthetic agents, the direction-dependent hysteresis phenomenon during the transitions between consciousness states, the mechanisms of cognitive alterations that follow an anesthetic procedure, the identification of an eventual unitary mechanism of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness, the relationship between network effects and the biochemical or sleep-wake cycle targets of anesthetic agents, as well as the vast between-studies variations in dose and administration mode, leading to difficulties in between-studies comparisons. In this narrative review, we draw the picture of the current state of knowledge in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, from insights gathered on propofol, halogenated vapors, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines and xenon. We also describe how anesthesia can help understanding consciousness, we develop the above-mentioned unresolved questions, and propose tracks for future research.

Properties of synaptic release dictates the core of information transfer in neural circuits. 
Despite decades of technical and theoretical advances, distinguishing bona fide information content from the multiple sources of synaptic variability remains a challenging problem. Here, we employed a combination of computational approaches with cellular electrophysiology, two-photon uncaging of MNI-Glutamate and imaging at single synapses. We describe and calibrate the use of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR  and  found that its kinetic profile is close to that of AMPA receptors, therefore providing several distinct advantages over slower methods relying on NMDA receptor activation (i.e., chemical or genetically encoded Calcium indicators). Using an array of statistical methods, we further developed, and validated on surrogate data, an expectation-maximization algorithm that, by biophysically constraining release variability, extracts the quantal parameters n (maximum number of released vesicles) and p (unitary probability of release) from single-synapse iGluSnFR-mediated transients. Together, we present a generalizable mathematical formalism which, when applied to optical recordings, paves the way to an increasingly precise investigation of information transfer at central synapses.

Secreted amyloid precursor protein-Î± (sAPPÎ±) is a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing molecule, however the mechanisms through which sAPPÎ± promotes these effects are not well understood. Recently, we have shown that sAPPÎ± enhances cell-surface expression of glutamate receptors. Activity-related cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc (Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene capable of modulating long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic plasticity through regulation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor localization. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sAPPÎ± may enhance synaptic plasticity, in part, by the de novo synthesis of Arc. Using primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures we found that sAPPÎ± (1 nM, 2 h) enhances levels of Arc mRNA and protein. Arc protein levels were increased in both the neuronal somata and dendrites in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent manner. Additionally, dendritic Arc expression was dependent upon activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase G. The enhancement of dendritic Arc protein was significantly reduced by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine (Î±7nACh) receptors, and fully eliminated by dual application of these antagonists. This effect was further corroborated in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices. These data suggest sAPPÎ±-regulated plasticity within hippocampal neurons is mediated by cooperation of NMDA and Î±7nACh receptors to engage a cascade of signal transduction molecules to enhance the transcription and translation of Arc.

Background: Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was standardized in 2014, there have been few studies reporting the risk factors and neuropsychological assessment characteristics of SCD (plus) in memory clinic.
Objective: To characterize SCD (plus) by comparing it with normal control (NC), amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer Disease (AD) regarding their demographics, lifestyle, family history of dementia, multimorbidity and the neuropsychological assessments.
Methods: A total of 135 participants were recruited, including 23 NC, 30 SCD (plus), 45 aMCI and 37 AD. Descriptive statistics were provided. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the affecting factors of SCD (plus), and finally the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to distinguish between SCD (plus) and NC.
Results: (1) SCD (plus) group was younger than both the aMCI group and AD group. It consisted of more participants with mental work and higher body mass index (BMI) than the AD group. (2) Scores of Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Immediate recall (AVLT-IR) and AVLT-Long delayed recall (AVLT-LR) decreased in the following order: NCâSCD (plus)âaMCIâAD. (3) The Area Under Curve (AUC) for discriminating SCD (plus) and NC group was from 0.673 to 0.838.
Conclusions: Ageing is an important risk factor of both NC progressing to SCD (plus), and SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD. In addition to ageing, lower education level and lower BMI were significantly associated with greater odds of SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD patients, whereas mental work was a protective factor of SCD (plus) progressing to AD. Finally, AVLT is a sensitive indicator of the cognitive decline and impairment in SCD (plus) in relative to normal controls.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common memory-impairment disorder frequently accompanied by olfactory identification (OI) impairments. In fact, OI is a valuable marker for distinguishing AD from normal age-related cognitive impairment and may predict the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-AD transition. However, current olfactory tests were developed based on Western social and cultural conditions, and are not very suitable for Chinese patients. Moreover, the neural substrate of OI in AD is still unknown. The present study investigated the utility of a newly developed Chinese Smell Identification Test (CSIT) for OI assessment in Chinese AD and MCI patients. We then performed a correlation analysis of gray matter volume (GMV) at the voxel and region-of-interest (ROI) levels to reveal the neural substrates of OI in AD. Thirty-seven AD, 27 MCI, and 30 normal controls (NCs) completed the CSIT and MRI scans. Patients (combined AD plus MCI) scored significantly lower on the CSIT compared to NCs (F (2, 91) = 62.597, p &lt; 0.001). Voxel-level GMV analysis revealed strong relationships between CSIT score and volumes of the left precentral gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG). In addition, ROI-level GMV analysis revealed associations between CSIT score and left amygdala volumes. Our results suggest the following: 1) OI, as measured by the CSIT, is impaired in AD and MCI patients compared with healthy controls in the Chinese population; 2) the severity of OI dysfunction can distinguish patients with cognitive impairment from controls and AD from MCI patients; and 3) the left-precentral cortex and L-IFG may be involved in the processing of olfactory cues.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS stimulation over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. 
Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 19 healthy controls, underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61 % of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of a group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. 
A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, grey matter volume, and cortical thickness) as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58 %; 95% CI: 42% - 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.

Advances in fMRI acquisition have improved signal to noise to the point where the physiology of the subject is the dominant noise source in resting state fMRI data (rsfMRI).  Among these systemic, non-neuronal physiological signals, respiration and to some degree cardiac fluctuations can be removed through modeling, or in the case of newer, faster acquisitions such as simultaneous multislice acquisition, simple spectral filtering. However, significant low frequency physiological oscillation (~0.01-0.15 Hz) remains in the signal. This is problematic, as it is the precise frequency band occupied by the neuronally modulated hemodynamic responses used to study brain connectivity, precluding its removal by spectral filtering.
The source of this signal, and its method of production and propagation in the body, have not been conclusively determined.  Here we summarize the defining characteristics of the systemic low frequency noise signal, and review some current theories about the signal source and the evidence supporting them. 
The strength and distribution of the systemic LFO signal make characterizing and removing it essential for accurate quantification, especially for resting state connectivity, when no stimulation can be compared with the signal. Widespread correlated non-neuronal signals obscure and distort the more localized patterns of neuronal correlations between interacting brain regions; they may even cause apparent connectivity between regions with no neuronal interaction. Here we discuss a simple method we have developed to parse the global, moving, blood-borne signal from the stationary, neuronal connectivity signals, substantially reducing the negative correlations that result from global signal regression.	
Finally, we will discuss some of the uses to which the moving systemic low frequency oscillation can be put if we consider it a âsignalâ carrying information, rather than simply ânoiseâ complicating the interpretation of resting state connectivity. Properly utilizing this signal may offer insights into subtle hemodynamic alterations that can be used as early indicators of circulatory dysfunction in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as prodromal stroke, moyamoya, and Alzheimerâs disease.

Spexin (SPX) is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that is expressed in the mammalian brain and peripheral tissue. Two orthologues are present in the teleost, SPX1 and SPX2. SPX1 is involved in reproduction and food intake. Recently, SPX1 neurons have been found to be located in the specific nuclei of dorsal habenula (dHb) and to project into the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), in which galanin receptor 2a/2b (GALR2a/2b) expression was also observed. This indicates that habenula SPX1 neurons may interact with GALR2a/2b in the IPN; however, the function of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neuronal circuit remains unknown. To determine the role of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neural circuit, we generated transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 specifically in the dHb. We found that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 in the dHb had anxiolytic behaviors compared with their wildtype siblings. Furthermore, quantitative PCR revealed that mRNA expression of galr2a and galr2b in the IPN and serotonin-related genes in the raphe was upregulated in the brains of transgenic zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that SPX1 function in the dHb-IPN neural circuits is implicated in the regulation of anxiety behaviors via modulation of the serotoninergic system in zebrafish.

Individuals differ in their vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence, which is determined by innate and environmental factors. The corticostriatal circuit is heavily involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may contain neural information regarding vulnerability to drink excessively. In the current experiment, we hypothesized that we could characterize high and low alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD, respectively) based on corticostriatal oscillations, and that these subgroups would differentially respond to corticostriatal brain stimulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 13) were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (&gt;80% accuracy). Moreover, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p&lt;0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p&gt;0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.

Despite recent extensive genomic and genetic studies on behavioral responses to ethanol, relatively few new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder have been validated. Here we describe a cross-species genomic approach focused on identifying gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. To identify brain mechanisms underlying a chronic ethanol consumption phenotype highly relevant to human alcohol use disorder, and to elucidate potential future therapeutic targets, we conducted a genomic study in a nonhuman primate model of chronic open-access ethanol consumption. Microarray analysis of RNA expression in anterior cingulate and subgenual cortices from rhesus macaques was performed across multiple cohorts of animals. Gene networks correlating with ethanol consumption or showing enrichment for ethanol-regulated genes were identified, as were major ethanol-related hub genes within these networks.  A subsequent consensus module analysis was used to co-analyze monkey data with expression data from a chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposure and consumption model in C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol-related gene networks conserved between primates and rodents were enriched for genes involved discrete biological functions, including; myelination, synaptic transmission, chromatin modification, Golgi apparatus function, translation, cellular respiration, and RNA processing.  The myelin-related network, in particular, showed strong correlations with ethanol consumption behavior and displayed marked network reorganization between control and ethanol-drinking animals. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that these networks also showed highly significant overlap with other ethanol-regulated gene sets. Altogether, these studies provide robust primate and rodent cross-species validation of gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. Our results also suggest potential novel focal points for future therapeutic interventions in alcohol use disorder.

Hyperglycemia-induced neuronal apoptosis is one of the important reasons for diabetic neuropathy. Long time exposure to high glucose accelerates many aberrant glucose metabolic pathways and eventually leads to neuronal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms of metabolic alterations remain unknown. TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of glycolysis and increases the flux of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by regulating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). TIGAR is highly expressed in neuron. But the role of TIGAR in hyperglycemia-induced neuronal injury is still unclear. In this study, we observed that TIGAR and G6PD are decreased in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Correspondingly, in cultured primary neurons and Neuro-2a cell line, stimulation with high glucose induced significant neuronal apoptosis and down-regulation of TIGAR expression. Overexpression of TIGAR reduced the number of TUNEL-positive neurons and prevented the activation of Caspase-3 in cultured neurons. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of TIGAR rescued high glucose-induced autophagy impairment and the decrease of G6PD. Nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), a negative regulator of autophagy, is also inhibited by overexpression of TIGAR. Inhibition of autophagy abolished the protective effect of TIGAR in neuronal apoptosis in Neuro-2a. Importantly, overexpression of TIGAR in the hippocampus ameliorated STZ-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Therefore, our data demonstrated that TIGAR may play anti-apoptosis effect via up-regulation of autophagy in diabetic neuropathy.

GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission contributes to diverse aspects of brain development and adult plasticity, including the expression of complex cognitive processes. This is afforded for in part by the dynamic adaptations occurring at inhibitory synapses, which show great heterogeneity both in terms of upstream signalling and downstream effector mechanisms. Single-particle tracking and live imaging have revealed that complex receptor-scaffold interactions critically determine adaptations at GABAergic synapses. Super-resolution imaging studies have shown that protein interactions at synaptic sites contribute to nano-scale scaffold re-arrangements through post-translational modifications, facilitating receptor and scaffold recruitment to synaptic sites. Additionally plasticity mechanisms may be affected by the protein composition at individual synapses and the type of pre-synaptic input. This mini-review examines recent discoveries of plasticity mechanisms that are operational within GABAergic synapses, and discusses their contribution towards functional heterogeneity in inhibitory neurotransmission.

Social behavior exhibits a wide diversity among vertebrates though it is controlled by a conserved neural network, the social behavior network (SBN). The activity of the SBN is shaped by hypothalamic nonapeptides of the vasopressin-oxytocin family. The weakly electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio emits social electrical signals during courtship. Three types of vasotocin (AVT) cells occur in the preoptic area (POA), one of the SBN nodes. In this study, we aimed to test if POA neurons of the nucleus preopticus ventricularis anterior (PPa) and posterior (PPp), and in particular AVT+ cells, were activated by social stimuli using a 2-day behavioral protocol. During the first night, male-female dyads were recorded to identify courting males. During the second night, these males were divided in two experimental conditions: isolated and social (male with a female). Both AVT cells and the cellular activation of the POA neurons (measured by FOS) were identified.  We found that the PPa of social males showed more FOS+ cells than the PPa of isolated males, and that the PPa had more AVT+ cells in social males than in isolated males. The double-immunolabeling for AVT and FOS indicated the activation of AVT+ neurons. No significant differences in the activation of AVT+ cells were found between conditions, but a clear association was observed between the number of AVT+ cells and certain behavioral traits. In addition, a different activation of AVT+ cell-types was observed for social versus isolated males. We conclude that the POA of B. gauderio exhibits      changes induced by social stimuli in reproductive context, involving an increase in AVT production and a different profile activation among AVT+ cell populations.

The transition of tau proteins from its soluble physiological conformation to the pathological aggregate forms found in Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias, is poorly understood.  Therefore, understanding the process that modulates the formation of toxic tau oligomers and their conversion to putative neuroprotective neurofibrillary tangles will lead to better therapeutic strategies.  We previously identified that EFhd2 is associated with aggregated tau species in AD brains and the coiled-coil domain in EFhd2 mediates the interaction with tau. To further characterize the association between EFhd2 and tau, we examined whether EFhd2 could affect the liquid-liquid phase separation properties of tau under molecular crowding conditions.  We demonstrate that EFhd2 alters tau liquid phase behavior in a calcium and coiled-coil domain dependent manner.  Co-incubation of EFhd2 and tau in the absence of calcium leads to the formation of solid-like structures containing both proteins, while in the presence of calcium these two proteins phase separate together into liquid droplets.  EFhd2âs coiled-coil domain is necessary to alter tauâs liquid phase separation, indicating that protein-protein interaction is required.  The results demonstrate that EFhd2 affects the liquid-liquid phase separation of tau proteins in vitro, suggesting that EFhd2 modulates the structural dynamics of tau proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00825">Resting State fMRI: Going Through the Motions</a></h4>

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimetre scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, "real-time" correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: 1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and 2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.

Alzheimerâs disease, and dementia, represents a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, this condition does not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with Alzheimerâs disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, attention was focused on the use of sensors, both wearable and environmental; personal devices, including TV, PC, tablet, and smartphone; and finally, robots, both standalone and cloud networked. The idea is to depict the framework and describe the most meaningful research efforts in this field of study to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and depict prospective future research. Regarding data sources, the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00282">Negative Emotional Stimuli Enhance Conflict Resolution Without Altering Arousal</a></h4>

In our daily life, we frequently need to make decisions between competing behavioral options while we are exposed to various contextual factors containing emotional/social information. We examined how changes in emotional/arousal state influence resolving conflict between behavioural rules. Visual stimuli with emotional content (positive, negative and neutral) and music, which could potentially alter emotional/arousal states, were included in the task context while participants performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The WCST requires the application of abstract matching rules, to resolve conflict between competing behavioural options. We found that conflict influenced both accuracy and response time in implementing rules. Measuring event-related autonomic responses indicated that these behavioural effects were accompanied by concomitant alterations in arousal levels. Performance in the WCST was modulated by the emotional content of visual stimuli and appeared as a faster response and higher accuracy when trials commenced with negative emotional stimuli. These effects were dependent on the level of conflict but were not accompanied by changes in arousal levels. Here, we report that conflict-induced behavioural alterations are accompanied by concomitant changes in participantsâ arousal/emotional state. Visual stimuli with emotional content influence conflict resolution and conflict-induced behavioural adjustments without trial-by-trial changes in arousal level. Our findings indicate intricate interactions between emotional context and various aspects of executive control such as conflict resolution and suggest that these interactions are not necessarily mediated through alterations in arousal level.

Trust and reciprocity are cornerstones of human nature, both at the levels of close interpersonal relationships and economic/societal structures. Being able to both place trust in others and decide whether to reciprocate trust placed in us is rooted in implicit and explicit processes that guide expectations of others, help reduce social uncertainty and build relationships. This review will highlight neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity, through the lens of implicit and explicit social appraisal and learning processes.  Significant consideration will be given to the neural underpinnings of these implicit and explicit processes, and special focus will center on the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms facilitating the integration of implicit and explicit signals supporting trust and reciprocity. Finally, this review will conclude with discussion of how we can leverage findings regarding the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity to better inform our understanding of mental health disorders characterized by social dysfunction.

Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is important for clinical assessment and treatment planning of brain tumors. Recent years have seen an increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but most of them use either 2D networks with relatively low memory requirement while ignoring 3D context, or 3D networks exploiting 3D features while with large memory consumption. In addition, existing methods rarely provide uncertainty information associated with the segmentation result. We propose a cascade of CNNs to segment brain tumors with hierarchical subregions from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), and introduce a 2.5D network that is a trade-off between  memory consumption, model complexity and receptive field. In addition, we employ test-time augmentation to achieve improved segmentation accuracy, which also provides voxel-wise and structure-wise uncertainty information of the segmentation result. Experiments with BraTS 2017 dataset showed that our cascaded framework with 2.5D CNNs was one of the top performing methods (second-rank) for the BraTS challenge. We also validated our method with BraTS 2018 dataset and found that test-time augmentation improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy and that the resulting uncertainty information can indicate potential mis-segmentations and help to improve segmentation accuracy.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are important building blocks in technical applications. They rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. We propose to bridge this gap with Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models. What is missing, however, are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers.

Here, a learning rule for feed-forward SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality is demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data when the learning rule is applied together with an optimizer. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision this learning rule for SBS networks to provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.

Introduction. While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia such as Alzheimerâs disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modelling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment. Methods. The Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population
1
dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N=8) and Alzheimerâs Disease (AD, N=10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N=15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.lni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG). Results. Known empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains. Discussion. We demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To understand the pathogenesis of specific neuronal circuit dysfunction in Alzheimerâs disease (AD), we investigated the fate of three subclasses of âmodulatory interneuronsâ in hippocampal CA1 using the <span style="font-style: italic;">AppNL-F/NL-F</span> knock-in mouse model of AD. Cholecystokinin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons were aberrantly hyperactive preceding the presence of the typical AD hallmarks: neuroinflammation and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) accumulation. These interneurons showed an age-dependent vulnerability to AÎ² penetration and a reduction in density and coexpression of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA synthesis enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), suggesting a loss in their inhibitory function. However, calretinin (CR) interneuronsâspecialized to govern <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> inhibition, showed resilience to AÎ² accumulation, preservation of structure, and displayed synaptic hyperinhibition, despite the lack of inhibitory control of CA1 excitatory pyramidal cells from midstages of the disease. This aberrant inhibitory homeostasis observed in CA1 CR cells and pyramidal cells was ânormalizedâ by blocking P2Y1 purinoreceptors, which were âupregulatedâ and strongly expressed in CR cells and astrocytes in <span style="font-style: italic;">AppNL-F/NL-F</span> mice in the later stages of AD. In summary, AD-associated cell-type selective destruction of inhibitory interneurons and disrupted inhibitory homeostasis rectified by modulation of the upregulated purinoreceptor system may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to normalize selective dysfunctional synaptic homeostasis during pathogenesis of AD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While the hippocampus (HPC) is a prime candidate combining object identity and location due to its strong connections to the ventral and dorsal pathways via surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, recent physiological studies have reported spatial information in the ventral pathway and its downstream target in MTL. However, it remains unknown whether the objectâlocation association proceeds along the ventral MTL pathway before HPC. To address this question, we recorded neuronal activity from MTL and area anterior inferotemporal cortex (TE) of two macaques gazing at an object to retain its identity and location in each trial. The results showed significant effects of objectâlocation association at a single-unit level in TE, perirhinal cortex (PRC), and HPC, but not in the parahippocampal cortex. Notably, a clear area difference emerged in the association form: 1) representations of object identity were added to those of subjectsâ viewing location in TE; 2) PRC signaled both the additive form and the conjunction of the two inputs; and 3) HPC signaled only the conjunction signal. These results suggest that the object and location signals are combined stepwise at TE and PRC each time primates view an object, and PRC may provide HPC with the conjunctional signal, which might be used for encoding episodic memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electrical activity is important for brain development. In brain slices, human subplate neurons exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that is highly sensitive to lanthanum. Based on the results of pharmacological experiments in human fetal tissue, we hypothesized that hemichannel-forming connexin (Cx) isoforms 26, 36, and 45 would be expressed on neurons in the subplate (SP) zone. RNA sequencing of dissected human cortical mantles at ages of 17â23 gestational weeks revealed that Cx45 has the highest expression, followed by Cx36 and Cx26. The levels of Cx and pannexin expression between male and female fetal cortices were not significantly different. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Cx45- and Cx26-expressing neurons in the upper segment of the SP zone. Cx45 was present on the cell bodies of human SP neurons, while Cx26 was found on both cell bodies and dendrites. Cx45, Cx36, and Cx26 were strongly expressed in the cortical plate, where newborn migrating neurons line up to form cortical layers. New information about the expression of 3 âneuronalâ Cx isoforms in each cortical layer/zone (e.g., SP, cortical plate) and pharmacological data with cadmium and lanthanum may improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal development in human fetuses and potential vulnerabilities.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain asymmetry is inherent to cognitive processing and seems to reflect processing efficiency. Lower frontal asymmetry is often observed in older adults during memory retrieval, yet it is unclear whether lower asymmetry implies an age-related increase in contralateral recruitment, whether less asymmetry reflects compensation, is limited to frontal regions, or predicts neurocognitive stability or decline. We assessed age-related differences in asymmetry across the entire cerebral cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 89 young and 76 older adults during successful retrieval, and surface-based methods allowing direct homotopic comparison of activity between cortical hemispheres 
. An extensive left-asymmetric network facilitated retrieval in both young and older adults, whereas diverse frontal and parietal regions exhibited lower asymmetry in older adults. However, lower asymmetry was not associated with age-related increases in contralateral recruitment but primarily reflected either less deactivation in contralateral regions reliably signaling retrieval failure in the young or lower recruitment of the dominant hemisphereâsuggesting that functional deficits may drive lower asymmetry in older brains, not compensatory activity. Lower asymmetry predicted neither current memory performance nor the extent of memory change across the preceding ~â8Â years in older adults. Together, these findings are inconsistent with a compensation account for lower asymmetry during retrieval and aging.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method of disease classification for bipolar disorder (BD) by functional activity and connectivity using radiomics analysis. Ninety patients with unmedicated BD II as well as 117 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A total of 4 types of 7018 features were extracted after preprocessing, including mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Then, predictive features were selected by MannâWhitney <span style="font-style: italic;">U</span> test and removing variables with a high correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was further used to select features. At last, support vector machine (SVM) model was used to estimate the state of each subject based on the selected features after LASSO. Sixty-five features including 54 RSFCs, 7 mALFFs, 1 mReHo, and 3 VMHCs were selected. The accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of the SVM model built based on the 65 features is 87.3% and 0.919 in the training dataset, respectively, and the accuracy and AUC of this model validated in the validation dataset is 80.5% and 0.838, respectively. These findings demonstrate a valid radiomics approach by rs-fMRI can identify BD individuals from healthy controls with a high classification accuracy, providing the potential adjunctive approach to clinical diagnostic systems.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The pulvinar is the largest extrageniculate visual nucleus in mammals. Given its extensive reciprocal connectivity with the visual cortex, it allows the cortico-thalamocortical transfer of visual information. Nonetheless, knowledge of the nature of the pulvinar inputs to the cortex remains elusive. We investigated the impact of silencing the pulvinar on the contrast response function of neurons in 2 distinct hierarchical cortical areas in the cat (areas 17 and 21a). Pulvinar inactivation altered the response gain in both areas, but with larger changes observed in area 21a. A theoretical model was proposed, simulating the pulvinar contribution to cortical contrast responses by modifying the excitation-inhibition balanced state of neurons across the cortical hierarchy. Our experimental and theoretical data showed that the pulvinar exerts a greater modulatory influence on neuronal activity in area 21a than in the primary visual cortex, indicating that the pulvinar impact on cortical visual neurons varies along the cortical hierarchy.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Behavioral change studies and interventions focus on self-control and external reinforcements to influence preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months by merely associating items with neutral cues and speeded responses. We utilized this paradigm to study neural representation of preferences and their modification without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30Â days following CAT. We preregistered the predictions that activity in memory, top-down attention, and value-processing regions will underlie preference modification. While most theories associate preferences with prefrontal regions, we found that âbottom-upâ perceptual mechanisms were associated with immediate change, whereas reduced âtop-downâ parietal activity was related to long-term change. Activity in value-related prefrontal regions was enhanced immediately after CAT for trained items and 1Â month after for all items. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that nonreinforced change of preferences occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, putatively leading to long-term changes in âtop-downâ processes. These findings offer implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions for long-lasting behavioral change.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Measuring brain morphology with non-invasive structural magnetic resonance imaging is common practice, and can be used to investigate neuroplasticity. Brain morphology changes have been reported over the course of weeks, days, and hours in both animals and humans. If such short-term changes occur even faster, rapid morphological changes while being scanned could have important implications. In a randomized within-subject study on 47 healthy individuals, two high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired (Ã¡ 263Â s) per individual. The images were acquired during passive viewing of pictures or a fixation cross. Two common pipelines for analyzing brain images were used: voxel-based morphometry on gray matter (GM) volume and surface-based cortical thickness. We found that the measures of both GM volume and cortical thickness showed increases in the visual cortex while viewing pictures relative to a fixation cross. The increase was distributed across the two hemispheres and significant at a corrected level. Thus, brain morphology enlargements were detected in less than 263Â s. Neuroplasticity is a far more dynamic process than previously shown, suggesting that individualsâ current mental state affects indices of brain morphology. This needs to be taken into account in future morphology studies and in everyday clinical practice.</span>

In contrast to high-contrast stimuli of longer duration, which elicit reliable activity in individual neurons, stimuli at the threshold of perception elicit extremely sparse and unreliable responses in the primary visual cortex such that the activity of individual neurons does not reliably report orientation. Integrating information across neurons, however, quickly improves performance. Using a linear decoding model, we estimate that integrating information over 50â100 neurons is sufficient to account for behavioral performance. Thus, at the limits of visual perception, the visual system integrates information encoded in the probabilistic firing of unreliable single units to generate reliable behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world items, and concepts. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-constrained rule for spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The model depends critically on 2 parameters, which control the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By modifying these 2 parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited to encode the associated memories. Hence, our findings suggest that the brain can use both of these 2 neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch between them during consolidation.</span>

Neurological deficits and cognitive dysfunctions caused by acute ischemic stroke pose enormous burden to the stroke families and the communities. Restoration of the normal function of the neurovascular unit following ischemic stroke is critical for improving neurological recovery and cognitive functions after stroke. Recent evidences suggest that the myeloid cells including both the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils are highly plastic in response to the environmental cues. They intimately interact with multiple components of the neurovascular unit in response to the alarmins, danger associated pattern molecules (DAMPs) and other signals released from the ischemic brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the reciprocal interactions between the myeloid cells and the ischemic neurovascular unit during the late repair phase of cerebral ischemic stroke. We also summarize potential immunotherapeutic targets on myeloid cells and new therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, such as cell transplantation, mitochondrial dynamic and extracellular vesicles-based therapy and et al to enhance neurovascular repair for better stroke recovery.

Optical stimulation and imaging of neurons deep in the brain require implantable optical neural probes. External optical access to deeper regions of the brain is limited by scattering and absorption of light as it propagates through tissue. Implantable optoelectronic probes capable of high-resolution light delivery and high-density neural recording are needed for closed-loop manipulation of neural circuits. Micro-light-emitting diodes (ÂµLEDs) have been used for optical stimulation, but predominantly on rigid silicon or sapphire substrates. Flexible polymer neural probes would be preferable for chronic applications since they cause less damage to brain tissue. Flexible LED neural probes have been recently implemented by flip-chip bonding of commercially available ÂµLED chips onto flexible substrates. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic design for flexible optoelectronic neural interfaces with embedded gallium nitride ÂµLEDs that can be microfabricated at wafer-scale. Parylene C is used as the substrate and insulator due to its biocompatibility, compliance, and optical transparency. We demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional individually-addressable ÂµLED arrays. Our ÂµLEDs have sizes as small as 22 Âµm Ã 22 Âµm in arrays of up to 32 ÂµLEDs per probe shank. These devices emit blue light at a wavelength of 445 nm, suitable for stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2, with output power greater than 200 ÂµW at 2 mA. Our flexible optoelectronic probes are double-sided and can illuminate brain tissue from both sides of the flexible probe. Recording electrodes are co-fabricated with ÂµLEDs on the front- and backside of the optoelectronic probes for electrophysiology recording of neuronal activity from the volumes of tissue on the front- and backside simultaneously with bi-directional optical stimulation.

Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-timeâthat enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PETâpresents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.

In experimental psychology, subjects are confronted with computer-based
experimental paradigms. Creating such paradigms can require quite an effort.
PyParadigm is a newly developed Python library to ease the development of such
paradigms by employing a declarative approach to build user interfaces (UIs).
This approach is a highly code-efficient alternative to currently
available libraries. Although PyParadigm was initially developed for the
creation of experimental paradigms, it is generally suited to build UIs that
display or interact with 2D objects.

The cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions such as attention, language, working memory, emotion, goal-directed behavior and spatial navigation is constantly growing. However, an exact connectivity map between the hippocampus and cerebellum in mice is still unknown. Here, we conducted a tracing study to identify the sequence of transsynaptic, cerebellar-hippocampal connections in the mouse brain using combinations of recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) and pseudotyped deletion-mutant rabies (RABV) viruses. Stereotaxic injection of a primarily anterograde rAAV-WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-Cre tracer virus in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter mouse resulted in strong tdTomato labeling in hippocampal CA1 neurons, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), rhinal cortex (RC) as well as thalamic and cerebellar areas. Whereas hippocampal injections with the retrograde tracer virus rAAV-TTC (tetanus toxin C fragment)-eGFP, displayed eGFP positive cells in the rhinal cortex and subiculum. To determine the sequence of mono-transsynaptic connections between the cerebellum and hippocampus, we used the retrograde tracer RABVÎG-eGFP(EnvA). The tracing revealed a direct connection from the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), RC and subiculum (S), which are monosynaptically connected to thalamic laterodorsal and ventrolateral areas. These thalamic nuclei are directly connected to cerebellar fastigial (FN), interposed (IntP) and lateral (Lat) nuclei, discovering a new projection route from the fastigial to the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus in the mouse brain. Collectively, our findings suggest a new cerebellar-hippocampal connection via the laterodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus to RSC, RC and S. These results strengthen the notion of the cerebellumâs involvement in cognitive functions such as spatial navigation via a polysynaptic circuitry.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The multiplex role of cadherin-based adhesion complexes during development of pallial excitatory neurons has been thoroughly characterized. In contrast, much less is known about their function during interneuron development. Here, we report that conditional removal of N-cadherin (Cdh2) from postmitotic neuroblasts of the subpallium results in a decreased number of Gad65-GFP-positive interneurons in the adult cortex. We also found that interneuron precursor migration into the pallium was already delayed at E14. Using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay in the embryonic subpallium, we excluded decreased mitosis and elevated cell death as possible sources of this defect. Moreover, by analyzing the interneuron composition of the adult somatosensory cortex, we uncovered an unexpected interneuron-type-specific defect caused by <span style="font-style: italic;">Cdh2</span>-loss. This was not due to a fate-switch between interneuron populations or altered target selection during migration. Instead, potentially due to the migration delay, part of the precursors failed to enter the cortical plate and consequently got eliminated at early postnatal stages. In summary, our results indicate that Cdh2-mediated interactions are necessary for migration and survival during the postmitotic phase of interneuron development. Furthermore, we also propose that unlike in pallial glutamatergic cells, Cdh2 is not universal, rather a cell type-specific factor during this process.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain aging is highly variable and represents a challenge to delimit aging from disease processes. Moreover, genetic factors may influence both aging and disease. Here we focused on this issue and investigated effects of multiple genetic loci previously identified to be associated with late-onset Alzheimerâs disease (AD) on brain structure of older adults from a population sample. We calculated a genetic risk score (GRS) using genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies of AD and tested its effect on cortical thickness (CT). We observed a common pattern of cortical thinning (right inferior frontal, left posterior temporal, medial occipital cortex). To identify CT changes by specific biological processes, we subdivided the GRS effect according to AD-associated pathways and performed follow-up analyses. The common pattern from the main analysis was further differentiated by pathway-specific effects yielding a more bilateral pattern. Further findings were located in the superior parietal and mid/anterior cingulate regions representing 2 unique pathway-specific patterns. All patterns, except the superior parietal pattern, were influenced by apolipoprotein E. Our step-wise approach revealed atrophy patterns that partially resembled imaging findings in early stages of AD. Our study provides evidence that genetic burden for AD contributes to structural brain variability in normal aging.</span>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), also known as NG2 glia, arise from neural progenitor cells in the embryonic ganglionic eminences that also generate inhibitory neurons. They are ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system, remain proliferative through life, and generate oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter. OPCs exhibit some lineage plasticity, and attempts have been made to reprogram them into neurons, with varying degrees of success. However, little is known about how epigenetic mechanisms affect the ability of OPCs to undergo fate switch and whether OPCs have a unique chromatin environment around neuronal genes that might contribute to their lineage plasticity. Our bioinformatic analysis of histone posttranslational modifications at interneuron genes in OPCs revealed that OPCs had significantly fewer bivalent and repressive histone marks at interneuron genes compared to astrocytes or fibroblasts. Conversely, OPCs had a greater degree of deposition active histone modifications at bivalently marked interneuron genes than other cell types, and this was correlated with higher expression levels of these genes in OPCs. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of interneuron genes in OPCs than in other cell types lacked the histone posttranslational modifications examined. These genes had a moderately high level of expression, suggesting that the âno markâ interneuron genes could be in a transcriptionally âpoisedâ or âtransitionalâ state. Thus, our findings suggest that OPCs have a unique histone code at their interneuron genes that may obviate the need for erasure of repressive marks during their fate switch to inhibitory neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00778">Aging Neurovascular Unit and Potential Role of DNA Damage and Repair in Combating Vascular and Neurodegenerative Disorders</a></h4>

Progressive neurological deterioration poses enormous burden on the aging population with ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disease patients, such as Alzheimersâ disease and Parkinsonâs disease. The past two decades have witnessed remarkable advances in the research of neurovascular unit dysfunction, which is emerging as an important pathological feature that underlies these neurological disorders. Dysfunction of the unit allows penetration of blood-derived toxic proteins or leukocytes into the brain and contributes to white matter injury, disturbed neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation, which all eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction. Recent evidences suggest that aging-related oxidative stress, accumulated DNA damage and impaired DNA repair capacities compromises the genome integrity not only in neurons, but also in other cell types of the neurovascular unit, such as endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Combating DNA damage or enhancing DNA repair capacities in the neurovascular unit represents a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on aging related mechanisms that underlie DNA damage and repair in the neurovascular unit and introduce several novel strategies that target the genome integrity in the neurovascular unit to combat the vascular and neurodegenerative disorders in the aging brain.
