              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03919">Depolarization block induction via slow NaV1.1 inactivation in Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by the early onset of drug-resistant seizures and various comorbidities. Most cases of this severe and complex pathology are due to mutations of NaV1.1, a sodium channel mainly expressed in fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Layer et al. (Front. Cell. Neurosci. 15, 2021) showed that one of these mutations alters the voltage dependence of channel activation, as well as the voltage dependence and kinetics of slow inactivation. Implementing the three effects into a computational model, they predict that altered activation has the largest impact on channel function, as it causes the most severe firing rate reduction. Using a conductance-based model tailored to the dynamics of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons, we look deeper into slow inactivation. We exploit the timescale difference between this very slow process and the rest of the system to conduct a multiple-timescale analysis. We find that, upon prolonged stimulation, the onset of slow inactivation at lower voltage in mutant channels promotes depolarization block, another possible firing deficit aside from frequency reduction. The accelerated kinetics of slow inactivation in mutant channels hastens this transition. This suggests that slow inactivation alterations might for some Dravet variant contribute to the pathological mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04331">Neural Representational Consistency Emerges from Probabilistic Neural-Behavioral Representation Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual brains exhibit striking structural and physiological heterogeneity, yet neural circuits can generate remarkably consistent functional properties across individuals, an apparent paradox in neuroscience. While recent studies have observed preserved neural representations in motor cortex through manual alignment across subjects, the zero-shot validation of such preservation and its generalization to more cortices remain unexplored. Here we present PNBA (Probabilistic Neural-Behavioral Representation Alignment), a new framework that leverages probabilistic modeling to address hierarchical variability across trials, sessions, and subjects, with generative constraints preventing representation degeneration. By establishing reliable cross-modal representational alignment, PNBA reveals robust preserved neural representations in monkey primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) through zero-shot validation. We further establish similar representational preservation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), reflecting a general neural basis. These findings resolve the paradox of neural heterogeneity by establishing zero-shot preserved neural representations across cortices and species, enriching neural coding insights and enabling zero-shot behavior decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14592">The role of gap junctions and clustered connectivity in emergent synchronisation patterns of inhibitory neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhibitory interneurons, ubiquitous in the central nervous system, form networks connected through both chemical synapses and gap junctions. These networks are essential for regulating the activity of principal neurons, especially by inducing temporally patterned dynamic states. We aim to understand the dynamic mechanisms for synchronisation in networks of electrically and chemically coupled interneurons. We use the exact mean-field reduction to derive a neural mass model for both homogeneous and clustered networks. We first analyse a single population of neurons to understand how the two couplings interact with one another. We demonstrate that the network transitions from an asynchronous to a synchronous regime either by increasing the strength of the gap junction connectivity or the strength of the background input current. Conversely, the strength of inhibitory synapses affects the population firing rate, suggesting that electrical and chemical coupling strengths act as complementary mechanisms by which networks can tune synchronous oscillatory behavior. In line with previous work, we confirm that the depolarizing spikelet is crucial for the emergence of synchrony. Furthermore, find that the fast frequency component of the spikelet ensures robustness to heterogeneity. Next, inspired by the existence of multiple interconnected interneuron subtypes in the cerebellum, we analyse networks consisting of two clusters of cell types defined by differing chemical versus electrical coupling strengths. We show that breaking the electrical and chemical coupling symmetry between these clusters induces bistability, so that a transient external input can switch the network between synchronous and asynchronous firing. Together, our results shows the variety of cell-intrinsic and network properties that contribute to synchronisation of interneuronal networks with multiple types of coupling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10078">Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.10078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.

                arXiv:2505.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's remarkable energy efficiency and parallel processing capabilities for large-scale artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of three spiking neuron circuit architectures-Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH)-implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. Through extensive SPICE simulations, we explore the optimization of spiking frequency, energy per spike, and static power consumption. Our results show that the AH design achieves the highest throughput, demonstrating multi-gigahertz firing rates (up to 3 GHz) with attojoule energy costs. By contrast, the ML architecture excels in subthreshold to near-threshold regimes, offering robust low-power operation (as low as 0.385 aJ/spike) and biological bursting behavior. Although LIF benefits from a decoupled current mirror for high-frequency operation, it exhibits slightly higher static leakage compared to ML and AH at elevated supply voltages. Comparisons with previous node implementations (22 nm planar, 28 nm) reveal that 7 nm FinFETs can drastically boost energy efficiency and speed albeit at the cost of increased subthreshold leakage in deep subthreshold regions. By quantifying design trade-offs for each neuron architecture, our work provides a roadmap for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to deliver neuromorphic hardware capable of both ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.

                arXiv:2505.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit diverse temporal spike patterns, which are believed to support efficient, robust, and adaptive neural information processing. While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04089">A New Scope and Domain Measure Comparison Method for Global Convergence Analysis in Evolutionary Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence analysis is a fundamental research topic in evolutionary computation (EC). The commonly used analysis method models the EC algorithm as a homogeneous Markov chain for analysis, which is not always suitable for different EC variants, and also sometimes causes misuse and confusion due to their complex process. In this article, we categorize the existing researches on convergence analysis in EC algorithms into stable convergence and global convergence, and then prove that the conditions for these two convergence properties are somehow mutually exclusive. Inspired by this proof, we propose a new scope and domain measure comparison (SDMC) method for analyzing the global convergence of EC algorithms and provide a rigorous proof of its necessity and sufficiency as an alternative condition. Unlike traditional methods, the SDMC method is straightforward, bypasses Markov chain modeling, and minimizes errors from misapplication as it only focuses on the measure of the algorithm's search scope. We apply SDMC to two algorithm types that are unsuitable for traditional methods, confirming its effectiveness in global convergence analysis. Furthermore, we apply the SDMC method to explore the gene targeting mechanism's impact on the global convergence in large-scale global optimization, deriving insights into how to design EC algorithms that guarantee global convergence and exploring how theoretical analysis can guide EC algorithm design.

                arXiv:2505.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

                arXiv:2505.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering interpretable mathematical expressions. However, benchmarking SR methods remains challenging due to the diversity of algorithms, datasets, and evaluation criteria. In this work, we present an updated version of SRBench. Our benchmark expands the previous one by nearly doubling the number of evaluated methods, refining evaluation metrics, and using improved visualizations of the results to understand the performances. Additionally, we analyze trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and energy consumption. Our results show that no single algorithm dominates across all datasets. We propose a call for action from SR community in maintaining and evolving SRBench as a living benchmark that reflects the state-of-the-art in symbolic regression, by standardizing hyperparameter tuning, execution constraints, and computational resource allocation. We also propose deprecation criteria to maintain the benchmark's relevance and discuss best practices for improving SR algorithms, such as adaptive hyperparameter tuning and energy-efficient implementations.

                arXiv:2505.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.

                arXiv:2505.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.

                arXiv:2409.00306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics (RSHs) are known to have a certain robustness to noise. Mathematical analyses trying to quantify rigorously how robust RSHs are to a noisy access to the objective function typically assume that each solution is re-evaluated whenever it is compared to others. This aims at preventing that a single noisy evaluation has a lasting negative effect, but is computationally expensive and requires the user to foresee that noise is present (as in a noise-free setting, one would never re-evaluate solutions).
  In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of an evolutionary algorithm solving a single-objective noisy problem without re-evaluations. We prove that the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm without re-evaluations can optimize the classic LeadingOnes benchmark with up to constant noise rates, in sharp contrast to the version with re-evaluations, where only noise with rates $O(n^{-2} \log n)$ can be tolerated. This result suggests that re-evaluations are much less needed than what was previously thought, and that they actually can be highly detrimental. The insights from our mathematical proofs indicate that this similar results are plausible for other classic benchmarks.

                arXiv:2410.07547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. Compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training methods, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion. However, current online learning framework cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Hybrid Mechanism-Driven Firing (HM-DF) model, which is a family of advanced models that respectively adopt different spiking calculation schemes in the upper-region and lower-region of the firing threshold. We point out that HM-DF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and tackle the mismatch problem of surrogate gradients, as well as achieving full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that HM-DF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the field of online learning, without triggering further power consumption.

Abstract: The emergence of abstract rules from exemplars is a cornerstone of genuine intelligence in both biological and artificial systems. However, the internal organizational principles underlying different abstract rules remain poorly understood. We propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN), inspired by astrocyte signaling. The model globally configures and locally fine-tunes intrinsic neuronal properties via a two-stage neuromodulatory mechanism. This design enhances neuronal adaptability and diversity, thus enabling fine-grained analysis of internal organizational principles. We evaluate abstract rule emergence across four cognitive task sets. To probe internal organization, we examine network-level connectivity via structural modularity analysis and neuron-level functional biases via bin-wise lesion studies based on intrinsic properties. Our experiments show that HM-RSNN successfully achieves abstract rule emergence, with rule-contingent organizational principles evident at both network and neuron levels. These findings highlight the critical role of dynamic internal organization in supporting flexible cognition.

                arXiv:2406.09713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.

                arXiv:2501.18504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

                arXiv:2505.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e0230242025?rss=1">Characterizing Directional Dynamics of Semantic Prediction Based on Inter-regional Temporal Generalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>The event-related potential/field component N400(m) is a widely accepted neural index for semantic prediction. Top-down input from inferior frontal areas to perceptual brain regions is hypothesized to play a key role in generating the N400, but testing this has been challenging due to limitations of causal connectivity estimation. We here provide new evidence for a predictive model of speech comprehension in which IFG activity feeds back to shape subsequent activity in STG/MTG. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data was obtained from 21 participants (10 men, 11 women) during a classic N400 paradigm where the semantic predictability of a fixed target noun was manipulated in simple German sentences through the preceding verb. To estimate causality, we implemented a novel approach, based on machine learning and temporal generalization, to test the effect of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) on temporal regions. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained on IFG activity to classify less predicted (LP) and highly predicted (HP) nouns and tested on superior/middle temporal gyri (STG/MTG) activity, time-point by time-point. The reverse procedure was then performed to establish spatiotemporal evidence for or against causality. Significant decoding results were found in our bottom-up model, which were trained at hierarchically lower level areas (STG/MTG) and tested at the hierarchically higher IFG areas. Most interestingly, decoding accuracy also significantly exceeded chance level when the classifier was trained on IFG activity and tested on successive activity in STG/MTG. Our findings indicate dynamic top-down and bottom-up flow of information between IFG and temporal areas when generating semantic predictions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e0409242025?rss=1">Tracking Neural Correlates of Contextualized Meanings with Representational Similarity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although it is uncontroversial that word meanings shift depending on their context, our understanding of contextualized lexical meaning remains poor. How is a contextualized semantic space organized? In this MEG study (27 human participants, 16 women, 10 men, 1 nonbinary), we manipulated the semantic and syntactic contexts of wordforms to query the organization of this space. All wordforms were noun/verb ambiguous and varied in the semantic distance between their noun and verb uses: unambiguous stems, polysemes with distinct but related meanings, and homonyms with completely unrelated meanings. The senses of each stem were disambiguated by a unique discourse sentence and the items were placed in syntactic contexts of varying sizes. Univariate results characterized syntactic context as a bilateral and distributed effect. A multivariate representational similarity analysis correlated one-hot models of the categorical factors and contextualized embedding-based models with MEG activity. Of all models representing ambiguity, only a model differentiating between syntactic categories across contexts correlated with the brain. An All-Embeddings model, where each contextualized word had a distinct representation, explained distributed neural activity across the left hemisphere. Finally, a Syntactic Context model and Within-Context-Stem model were significant in left occipitoparietal regions. While the noun versus verb contrast affected neural signals robustly, we saw no evidence of the homonym&ndash;polyseme&ndash;unambiguous contrast, over and above the evidence for fully itemized representations. These findings suggest that in contexts devoid of ambiguity, the neural representation of a word is mainly shaped by its syntactic category and its contextually informed, unique semantic representation.</p>

                <p>Responses to acute stress function to restore homeostasis. Hence, the study of neurophysiological responses to acute stress helps to understand mechanisms underlying adaptive coping in the face of environmental demands. The infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC) modulates the switch between behavioral coping styles, and acute stress enhances glutamatergic neurotransmission on mPFC projection neurons. However, the role of acute stress responses and stress hormones on the physiology of IL-mPFC projection neurons during adulthood remains underexplored. Here, we studied rapid and slow effects of acute corticosterone exposure on synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane excitability in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the IL (L5-IL PNs) in adult male rats using ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp of mPFC slices. We report that corticosterone dynamically modulates the physiology of L5-IL PNs in a time-dependent manner. Specifically, corticosterone elicits a strong rapid shift of the excitatory&ndash;inhibitory balance toward enhanced excitation with mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) playing complementarily roles. Also, corticosterone rapidly and transiently decreases the firing rate of L5-IL PNs via GR. Moreover, acute stress or corticosterone slowly enhances glutamatergic neurotransmission via MR and GR without modulating inhibitory neurotransmission or intrinsic excitability of adult L5-IL PNs. Our findings highlight the potential relevance of corticosterone effects on L5-IL PNs to promote a homeostatic response in adult male rats. First, corticosterone rapidly attenuates IL intrinsic excitability during the rapid initial phase of the acute stress response. Later on, corticosterone slowly restores IL output function over time to promote adaptive executive responses when context changes.</p>

                <p>Encoding new memories relies on functional connections between the medial temporal lobe and the frontoparietal cortices. Multiscan fMRI showed changes in these functional connections before and after memory encoding, potentially influenced by the thalamus. As different thalamic nuclei are interconnected with distinct cortical networks, we hypothesized that variations in corticothalamic recruitment may impact individual memory performance. We used a multiscan fMRI protocol including a resting-state scan followed by an associative memory task encompassing encoding and retrieval phases, in two independent samples of healthy adults (<I>N</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 29, mean age = 26, males = 35%; <I>N</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 108, mean age = 28, males = 52%). Individual activity and functional connectivity were analyzed in the native space to minimize registration bias. By modeling the direct and indirect effects of corticothalamic recruitment on memory using structural equation modeling, we showed a positive association between resting-state functional connectivity of the medial thalamic subdivision within the frontoparietal network and memory performance across samples (effect size <I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.27 and 0.36; <I>p</I>-values between 0.01 and 4 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup>). This direct relationship was mediated by decreased activation of the anterior subdivision during encoding (<I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.04 and 0.2; <I>p</I>-values between 0.05 and 0.006) and by increased activation of the medial subdivision during retrieval (<I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.04 and 0.2; <I>p</I>-values between 0.05 and 0.004). Moreover, three distinct clusters of individuals displayed different corticothalamic patterns across memory phases. We suggest that associative memory encoding relies on the distinct corticothalamic pathways involving medial thalamic recruitment and suppression of anterior subdivision to support the successful encoding of new memories.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1340242025?rss=1">Hemifield Specificity of Attention Response Functions during Multiple-Object Tracking</a></h4>

              
                <p>The difficulty of tracking multiple moving objects among identical distractors increases with the number of tracked targets. Previous research has shown that the number of targets tracked (i.e., load) modulates activity in brain areas related to visuospatial attention, giving rise to so-called attention response functions (ARFs). While the hemifield/hemispheric effects of spatial attention (e.g., hemispatial neglect, hemifield capacity limits) are well described, it had not previously been tested whether a hemispheric or hemifield imbalance exists among ARFs. By recording blood oxygenation level-dependent activity from human brains (<I>n</I> = 19, female and male) in a multiple-object tracking paradigm, we show that the number of tracked objects modulates activity in a large network of areas bilaterally. A significant effect of contralateral load was found in earlier areas throughout the dorsal and ventral visual streams, while the effects of ipsilateral load emerged in later areas. Both contra- and ipsilateral load significantly influenced activity in the parietal and frontal lobes, specifically the dorsal attention network. In addition, some brain regions in the occipital lobe were significantly more sensitive to contralateral than ipsilateral load. Our results are consistent with findings showing that a diverse set of brain areas contributes to tracking multiple targets. In particular, we extend the canonical view of load-based ARFs to include hemifield bias. Given the hemifield-specific nature of speed and capacity limits to multiple-object tracking, we conjecture that areas that show a strong hemifield preference may impose a bottleneck on processing that results in limits on the capacity and speed of tracking.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia are devastating brain illnesses that are often associated with deficits in social behaviors. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to the etiology underlying these social defects will be critical in developing therapeutic strategies for these disorders. Here, we have identified a crucial role of carboxyl-terminus (C-tail) of Neuroligin 2 (NL2), a cell adhesion molecule highly enriched at inhibitory synapses, in social behaviors. Indeed, we have found that genetic deletion of NL2 C-tail in mice (StopKI mice) significantly reduces GABAergic synaptic density and inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Importantly, both male and female StopKI mice also manifest elevated obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder-like phenotypes. In addition, we have observed impaired social cognition behaviors in these mice that have not been previously observed in NL2 knock-out mice. These data reveal an unappreciated role of the NL2 C-tail in regulating social behaviors and highlight the importance of NL2 C-tail&ndash;mediated signaling in delineating molecular determinants for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Mind wandering, occupying 30&ndash;50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience. A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions. Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving. We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands. We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (<I>N</I> = 37, 30 females). To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography. Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it. Spontaneous, as opposed to deliberate mind wandering, was particularly beneficial for extracting the probabilistic patterns hidden in the visual stream. Cortical oscillatory activity in the low-frequency (slow and delta) range, indicative of covert sleep-like states, was associated with both mind wandering and improved probabilistic learning, particularly in the early stages of the task. Given the importance of probabilistic implicit learning in predictive processing, our findings provide novel insights into the potential cognitive benefits of task-unrelated thoughts in addition to shedding light on its neural mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1471242025?rss=1">A Novel Candidate Neuromarker of Central Motor Dysfunction in Childhood Apraxia of Speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is conceived as an impairment of the central motor system's ability to program multiple speech movements, resulting in inaccurate transitions between and relative timing across speech sounds. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence base is scant and inconclusive, and the neurophysiological origins of these motor planning problems remain highly underspecified. In the first magnetoencephalography study of this disorder, we measured brain activity from typically developing (TD) children (<I>N</I> = 19, 11 males, 8 females) and children with CAS (<I>N</I> = 7 males) during performance of a speech task designed to interrogate function of the speech areas of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Relative to their TD peers, our sample of children with CAS showed abnormal speech-related responses within the mu-band motor rhythm, and beamformer source reconstruction analyses specify a brain origin of this speech rhythm in the left cerebral hemisphere, within or near pre-Rolandic motor areas crucial for the planning and control of speech and oromotor movements. These results provide a new and specific candidate mechanism for the core praxic features of CAS; point to a novel and robust neurophysiological marker of typical and atypical expressive speech development; and support an emerging neuroscientific consensus which assigns a central role for programming and coordination of speech movements to the motor cortices of the precentral gyrus.</p>

                <p>The inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is a critical region for reading and language. This part of the cortex is highly heterogeneous in its structural and functional organization and shows high variability across individuals. Despite decades of research, the relationship between specific IFC regions and reading skill remains unclear. To shed light on the function of IFC in reading, we aim to (1) characterize the functional landscape of text-selective responses in IFC, while accounting for interindividual variability, and (2) examine how text-selective regions in the IFC relate to reading proficiency. To this end, children with a wide range of reading ability (<I>N</I> = 66; age 7&ndash;14 years, 34 female, 32 male) completed functional MRI scans while performing two tasks on text and nontext visual stimuli. Importantly, both tasks do not explicitly require reading and can be performed on all visual stimuli. This design allows us to tease apart stimulus-driven responses from task-driven responses and examine where in IFC task and stimulus interact. We were able to identify three anatomically distinct, text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC, inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), and dorsal and ventral precentral gyrus (PrG). These three regions showed a strong task effect that was highly specific to text. Furthermore, text selectivity in the IFS and dorsal PrG was associated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text. These findings suggest that text-selective regions in the IFC are sensitive to both stimulus and task and highlight the importance of this region for proficient reading.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1806242025?rss=1">Hypothalamic Control of Learned Flight Induced by Threat Imminence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flexible experience-dependent learned escape has paramount survival value. However, flight is generally investigated in the presence of innate threats. To study conditioned escape, we developed a paradigm in which mice learn to escape a moving shock grid, which simulates a naturalistic situation of being chased by a threat. In a single session, mice learn to escape from the shock-delivering moving grid, displaying a "flight upon grid approach" (FUGA). Importantly, this learned flight is also displayed the next day during fear retrieval, in the absence of shock. We reasoned that circuits implicated in escape and learned fear control this behavior. Fittingly, cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd-cck neurons) are necessary for escape from innate threats, and PMd activity modulates learned defense, suggesting it may participate in the maintenance of learned FUGA escapes. Here, we show in male and female mice that inhibiting PMd-cck activity during FUGA acquisition impairs learned flight during fear retrieval. Furthermore, these results were specific to a paradigm with a moving threat, as PMd-cck inhibition during fear acquisition did not alter behavior during fear retrieval in contextual or auditory-cued fear conditioning. Lastly, PMd-cck cells encoded distance to the moving grid and FUGA escape speed, but were not activated by fear-conditioned tones or conditioned freezing. These data show that the PMd is critical for the maintenance of the memory of the threat associated with the grid and underscore recent views demonstrating that the hypothalamus has key contributions for learning flexible experience-dependent survival actions.</p>

                <p>Calcium-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) contribute to excitatory synaptic transmission and play pivotal roles in normal and detrimental forms of plasticity. Most AMPARs are associated with auxiliary subunits. Transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), the prototypical auxiliary subunits, enhance current through CP-AMPAR channels by increasing single-channel conductance and relieving the characteristic voltage-dependent block by endogenous intracellular polyamines, such as spermine. In contrast, the atypical auxiliary subunit GSG1L negatively regulates CP-AMPARs, suppressing current flow by promoting polyamine block and reducing channel conductance. Here, we investigated the role of polyamines in these opposing effects. We show that, in the absence of auxiliary subunits, intracellular spermine decreases CP-AMPAR single-channel conductance. This effect is prevented by the presence of TARPs but enhanced by the presence of GSG1L. Unexpectedly, intracellular spermine is necessary for both GSG1L&rsquo;s attenuation of CP-AMPAR channel conductance and its characteristic slowing of recovery from desensitization. These various effects are determined by specific residues within the channel&rsquo;s selectivity filter and within GSG1L's C-tail. Together, our findings reveal that intracellular polyamines play an essential role in GSG1L&rsquo;s unique ability to negatively regulate many of the key properties of CP-AMPARs.</p>

                <p>Recent rodent data suggest that the cerebellum&mdash;a region typically associated with processing sensory prediction errors (PEs)&mdash;also processes PEs in reinforcement learning (RL-PEs; i.e., learning from action outcomes). We tested whether cerebellar output is necessary for RL-PE processing in regions more traditionally associated with action-outcome processing, such as the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) was measured as a proxy of cerebral RL-PE processing in a probabilistic feedback learning task using electroencephalography. Two complementary experiments were performed in humans. First, patients with chronic cerebellar stroke (20 male, 6 female) and matched healthy controls (19 male, 7 female) were tested. Second, single-pulse cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied in healthy participants (7 male, 17 female), thus implementing a virtual lesion approach. Consistent with previous studies, learning of action-outcome associations was intact with only minor changes in behavioral flexibility. Importantly, no significant RL-PE processing was observed in the FRN in patients with cerebellar stroke and in participants receiving cerebellar TMS. Findings in both experiments show that RL-PE processing in the forebrain depends on cerebellar output in humans, complementing and extending previous findings in rodents.</p>

                <p>Generalization allows previous experience to adaptively guide behavior when conditions change. The infralimbic (IL) subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a known role in generalization processes, although mechanisms remain unclear. A basic physical unit of memory storage and expression in the brain is a sparse, distributed group of neurons known as an engram. Here, we set out to determine whether an engram established during learning contributes to generalized responses in IL. Generalization was tested in male and female mice by presenting a novel, ambiguous, tone generalization stimulus following pavlovian defensive (fear) conditioning. The first experiment was designed to test a global role for IL in generalization using chemogenetic manipulations. Results show IL regulates defensive behavior in response to ambiguous stimuli. IL silencing led to a switch in defensive state, from vigilant scanning to generalized freezing, while IL stimulation reduced freezing in favor of scanning. Leveraging activity-dependent "tagging" technology (ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> eYFP system), an engram, preferentially located in IL Layer 2/3, was associated with the generalization stimulus. Remarkably, in the identical discrete location, fewer reactivated neurons were associated with the generalization stimulus at the remote timepoint (30&nbsp;d) following learning. When an IL engram established during learning was selectively chemogenetically silenced, freezing increased. Conversely, IL engram stimulation reduced freezing, suggesting attenuated fear generalization. Overall, these data identify a crucial role for IL in suppressing generalized conditioned responses. Further, an IL engram formed during learning functions to later attenuate a conditioned response in the presence of ambiguous threat stimuli.</p>

                <p>The intrinsic timescales of single neurons are thought to be hierarchically organized across the cortex, but whether hierarchical variation in timescales is a general brain organizing principle across mammalian species remains unclear. Here, we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across frontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus in mice, monkeys, and humans of both sexes using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder occurs alongside impaired risk-related decision-making, but the underlying neural correlates are unclear. We developed an approach-avoidance conflict task using a modified conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure to study neural signals of risky opioid seeking in the prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in executive decision-making. Following morphine CPP, rats underwent a conflict test in which fear-inducing cat odor was introduced in the previously drug-paired side of the apparatus. While the saline-exposed control group avoided cat odor, the morphine group included two subsets of rats that either maintained a preference for the paired side despite the presence of cat odor (risk-takers) or exhibited increased avoidance (risk-avoiders), as revealed by <I>k</I>-means clustering. Single-unit recordings from the prelimbic cortex (PL) demonstrated decreased neuronal activity upon acute morphine exposure in both risk-takers and risk-avoiders, but this firing rate suppression was absent after repeated morphine administration. Risk-avoiders also displayed distinct post-morphine excitation in PL which persisted across conditioning. During the preference test, subpopulations of PL neurons in all groups were either excited or inhibited when rats entered the paired side. Interestingly, the inhibition in PL activity was lost during the subsequent conflict test in both saline and risk-avoider groups but persisted in risk-takers. Additionally, risk-takers showed an increase in the proportion of PL neurons displaying location-specific firing in the drug-paired side from the preference to the conflict test. Together, our results suggest that persistent PL inhibitory signaling in the drug-associated context during motivational conflict may underlie increased risk-taking behavior following opioid exposure.</p>

                Background Measurement is essential for methods of instruction to be successful. Having an instrument that is reliable and validated in the given setting is vital. The primary goal of this research project is to validate the instructional practice scale (IPS) for university instructors in the Ethiopian context. Methods By implementing a cross-sectional descriptive survey research design, 1,254 participants across four public universities – Arbaminch, Dilla, Wachamo, and Jinka representing the first, second, third, and fourth generations, respectively were randomly selected and participated. The data was split in half and underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results The three components of the EFA were alternately filled with seventeen items that satisfied certain standards, had a loading value of > .5, and a Cronbach alpha of ≥ .874. The factors identified in the EFA have been confirmed to be the thirteen items with loading, Cronbach alpha, Raykov’s rho coefficient (rho_A), composite reliability (CR) value of >.7, and Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of > .5. Tests of measurement and structural models showed a good fit. The Fornell-Larcker criterion, which is employed in discriminant validity analysis, demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlation it exhibits with other constructs. The correlations’ heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio is getting close to zero, and there isn’t one in the confidence interval at the.05 significance level. Both guaranteed strong discriminant validity. Conclusion For university instructors, the 13 items generally have powerful psychometric properties. The three subsections of the instruction practice scale—planning (4 indicators), delivering (4 indicators), and assessment (5 indicators) — are meant to measure the instructional practice effectively. Implications of the findings were further discussed.

                Background Empirical studies on the impact of devaluation in developing countries, including Ethiopia, have revealed diverse and mixed results. The effects can be positive or negative depending on the specific economic context and policies in place.This study addresses the devaluation puzzle by providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how devaluation affects the balance of payments and output. Methods To achieve this, we employ a recursive structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model focusing on Ethiopia from 2001Q1 to 2023Q4. Results The estimation results indicate that the real effective exchange rate channel effectively influences both the balance of payments and output in Ethiopia. Additionally, while foreign asset reserves, money supply, and inflation channels have a stronger impact on output, their effect on the balance of payments is relatively weak. The analysis further indicates that currency depreciation can improve the BOP in the short period by enhancing export competitiveness; however, it may have negative long-period effects due to rising import prices. Similarly, although an increased money supply can stimulate economic activity and strengthen the BOP, excessive expansion risks inflation and trade deficits. Furthermore, inflation negatively impacts both the BOP and GDP by escalating import costs and diminishing competitiveness. Foreign exchange reserves play a crucial role in supporting external liquidity and investor confidence, essential for economic stability. Conclusion The interconnectedness of these factors emphasizes the need for policymakers to implement effective management strategies, including enhancing foreign reserve management, controlling inflation, and adopting a balanced exchange rate policy. Continuous monitoring of these policies will help address emerging challenges and improve Ethiopia’s competitiveness in the global market.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revi</a></h4>

              
                Background Pleural mesothelioma is a cancer of the lung lining associated with asbestos exposure. Platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy has been used for many years but provides little benefit and, despite recent immunotherapy advances, prognosis remains poor underpinning the need for development of novel therapeutics or drug repurposing. Fertilized hens’ eggs provide a rapid and cost-effective alternative to murine models of pleural mesothelioma which are commonly used in preclinical studies, with chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenografts being a partial replacement for mouse flank xenografts. Here we describe methods to generate mesothelioma patient-derived xenografts on the CAM (CAM-PDX), and to subsequently assess these PDX nodules by preclinical imaging and histology. Methods Fragments of surplus mesothelioma tissue obtained from patient biopsies were implanted onto the CAM on embryonic day 7 (E7), fresh or following cryopreservation, with the established PDX dissected on E14 and fixed for histological/immunohistochemical analysis. The optimal freezing method was determined by comparing tissue integrity and cellular content of cryopreserved tissue fragments with paired fresh samples via histological/immunohistochemical analyses. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was used to assess viability of PDXs in ovo. Results Methodologies for processing, cryopreservation, re-animation, and engraftment of mesothelioma tissue fragments were established. Cryopreservation of biopsy samples and parallel processing of contiguous sections allows for assessment of mesothelioma cellularity. CAM-PDXs, generated from fresh or slow-frozen tissue, were well vascularized whilst maintaining the architecture and cellular composition of the patient tissue. Furthermore, uptake of [18F]-FDG following intravenous injection could be visualized and quantified. Conclusions The CAM is a rapid platform for engrafting patient-derived tissue, maintaining elements of the tumor microenvironment and recapitulating heterogeneity observed in mesothelioma. Combining the CAM-PDX model and FDG-PET/CT provides a quantitative in vivo platform for pre-screening of novel treatment strategies and drug combinations, with the potential for development of patient tumor avatars for predicting clinical response.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013092">Noise correlations and neuronal diversity may limit the utility of winner-take-all readout in a pop out visual search task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ori Hendler, Ronen Segev, Maoz Shamir</p>

Visual search involves active scanning of the environment to locate objects of interest against a background of irrelevant distractors. One widely accepted theory posits that pop out visual search is computed by a winner-take-all (WTA) competition between contextually modulated cells that form a saliency map. However, previous studies have shown that the ability of WTA mechanisms to accumulate information from large populations of neurons is limited, thus raising the question of whether WTA can underlie pop out visual search. To address this question, we conducted a modeling study to investigate how accurately the WTA mechanism can detect the deviant stimulus in a pop out task. We analyzed two types of WTA readout mechanisms: single-best-cell WTA, where the decision is made based on a single winning cell, and a generalized population-based WTA, where the decision is based on the winning population of similarly tuned cells. Our results show that neither WTA mechanism can account for the high accuracy found in behavioral experiments. The inherent neuronal heterogeneity prevents the single-best-cell WTA from accumulating information even from large populations, whereas the accuracy of the generalized population-based WTA algorithm is negatively affected by the widely reported noise correlations. These findings underscore the need to revisit the key assumptions explored in our theoretical analysis, particularly concerning the decoding mechanism and the statistical properties of neuronal population responses to pop out stimuli. The analysis identifies specific response statistics that require further empirical characterization to accurately predict WTA performance in biologically plausible models of visual pop out detection.

                <p>by Kathryn C. Krupinsky, Christian T. Michael, Pariksheet Nanda, Joshua T. Mattila, Denise Kirschner</p>

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of major public health concern with an estimated one-fourth of the world currently infected with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) bacilli. Mtb infection occurs after inhalation of Mtb, following which, highly structured immune structures called granulomas form within lungs to immunologically restrain and physically constrain spread of infection. Most lung granulomas are successful at controlling or even eliminating their bacterial loads, but others fail to control infection and promote disease. Granulomas also form within lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs), variably affecting immune function. Both lung and LN granulomas vary widely in ability to control infection, even within a single host, with outcomes ranging from bacterial clearance to uncontrolled bacterial growth. While lung granulomas are well-studied, data on LN granulomas are scarce; it is unknown what mechanisms drive LN Mtb infection progression and variability in severity. Recent data suggest that LN granulomas are niches for bacterial replication and can reduce control over lung infection. To identify mechanisms driving LN Mtb infection, we developed a multi-scale compartmental model that includes multiple lung-draining LNs, blood. We calibrated to data from a nonhuman primate TB model (one of the only models that parallels human TB infection). Our model predicts temporal trajectories for LN macrophage, T-cell, and Mtb populations during simulated Mtb infection. We also predict a clinically measurable infection feature from PET/CT imaging, FDG avidity. Using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods, we identify key mechanisms driving LN granuloma fate, T-cell efflux rates from LNs, and a role for LNs in pulmonary infection control.

                <p>by Chenchen Jia, Haiyun Wang, Jianping Zhao, Junfeng Xia, Chunhou Zheng</p>

As a fundamental characteristic of multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is achieved through ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, enabling the exchange of information and revealing the diversity of biological processes and cellular functions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these complex interaction mechanisms, we constructed a manually curated L-R interaction database and developed a semi-supervised graph embedding model called scSDNE for inferring cell-cell interactions mediated by L-R interactions. scSDNE model utilizes the power of deep learning to map genes from interacting cells into a shared latent space, allowing for a nuanced representation of their relationships. Leveraging the prior information provided by database, scSDNE can infer significant L-R pairs involved in intercellular communication. Experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets demonstrate that our method detects interactions with a high degree of reliability compared with other methods. More importantly, the model integrates gene regulation information within cells to enhance the accuracy and biological interpretability of the inferences. Our method provides a more comprehensive view of cell-cell interactions, offering new insights into complex intercellular communication.

                <p>by Quintin Pope, Rohan Varma, Christine Tataru, Maude M David, Xiaoli Fern</p>
We use open source human gut microbiome data to learn a microbial “language” model by adapting techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our microbial “language” model is trained in a self-supervised fashion (i.e., without additional external labels) to capture the interactions among different microbial taxa and the common compositional patterns in microbial communities. The learned model produces contextualized taxon representations that allow a single microbial taxon to be represented differently according to the specific microbial environment in which it appears. The model further provides a sample representation by collectively interpreting different microbial taxa in the sample and their interactions as a whole. We demonstrate that, while our sample representation performs comparably to baseline models in in-domain prediction tasks such as predicting Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) and diet patterns, it significantly outperforms them when generalizing to test data from independent studies, even in the presence of substantial distribution shifts. Through a variety of analyses, we further show that the pre-trained, context-sensitive embedding captures meaningful biological information, including taxonomic relationships, correlations with biological pathways, and relevance to IBD expression, despite the model never being explicitly exposed to such signals.

Vertebrate photoreceptors have been studied for well over a century, but a fixed nomenclature for referring to orthologous cell types across diverse species has been lacking. Instead, photoreceptors have been variably—and often confusingly—named according to morphology, presence/absence of ‘rhodopsin’, spectral sensitivity, chromophore usage, and/or the gene family of the opsin(s) they express. Here, we propose a unified nomenclature for vertebrate rods and cones that aligns with the naming systems of other retinal cell classes and that is based on the photoreceptor type’s putative evolutionary history. This classification is informed by the functional, anatomical, developmental, and molecular identities of the neuron as a whole, including the expression of deeply conserved transcription factors required for development. The proposed names will be applicable across all vertebrates and indicative of the widest possible range of properties, including their postsynaptic wiring, and hence will allude to their common and species-specific roles in vision. Furthermore, the naming system is open-ended to accommodate the future discovery of as-yet unknown photoreceptor types.

Interferon is a central component of the vertebrate antiviral immune response, thought to act through induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes, with some redundancy. Recent findings suggest a more refined ‘limited set’ model, in which distinct viruses are targeted by small subsets of the induced gene repertoire.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A longstanding principle in episodic memory research, known as the encoding specificity hypothesis, holds that an effective retrieval cue should closely match the original encoding conditions. This principle assumes that a successful retrieval cue remains static over time. Despite the broad acceptance of this idea, it conflicts with one of the most well-established findings in memory research: The dynamic and ever-changing nature of episodic memories. In this article, we propose that the most effective retrieval cue should engage with the current state of the memory, which may have shifted significantly since encoding. By redefining the criteria for successful recall, we challenge a core principle of the field and open new avenues for exploring memory accessibility, offering fresh insights into both theoretical, and applied domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-480/v1?src=rss">How Smart Can Museums Be? The Role of Cutting-Edge Technologies in Making Modern Museums Smarter [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research on technology-mediated visitor experiences, a holistic approach to the smart museum remains underexplored. This paper addresses the gap by examining novel technologies through a cultural lens, particularly their role in enhancing modern museums. We defined the concept and profile of the 21st-century smart museum based on a synthesis of findings from 83 papers and museum reports (2014–2024) on the modern museum, the museum experience, and the integration of innovative technologies. , Of these, 54 articles focused on six main technology categories—Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robots, Fusion, and others (Blockchain, Holography)—were reviewed. From the intersection of museums and technology in the digital era, 15 key characteristics emerged, outlining the ideal smart museum. This paper aims to serve as a framework and guide for cultural managers, museum professionals, and designers in creating and implementing smart museums.

                Neurons innervating the gut are on the frontlines of host-microbe interactions and thus exposed to a myriad of inflammatory and infectious insults. In this issue of Neuron, Forster, Jakob et al. reveal that diverse populations of gut-innervating neurons exhibit conserved responses to inflammation, linking interferon signaling to ferroptosis.

                Sonoda et al. showed that dLGN neurons exhibit long-lasting shifts of tuning preference toward selective features experienced during the classical critical period. They demonstrated that this plasticity results from feedforward-input refinement, revealing a different form of experience-dependent plasticity compared to V1.

                Men who take opioids to relieve pain are at the highest risk for maladaptive misuse and overdose, but a sex-specific neurobiological link between pain states and opioid use has not been identified. In this issue of Neuron, Higginbotham et al. identify estradiol as a potent suppressor of midbrain dopaminergic activity that selectively reduces fentanyl intake in males.

                The recent approval of suzetrigine for acute pain treatment highlights both the success of targeting peripheral sensory neurons for pain management and the potential of developing new pain therapies primarily in human-based systems. To realize this transformative potential, further research into somatosensation and pain neuroimmunology in human systems is essential.

                Lee et al. find that cyclic stretch induces epithelial cell columnarization via Piezo1-dependent mechanotransduction, involving apical cytoskeletal remodeling, tight junction straightening, and enhanced apical-basal tension, highlighting the mechanobiological pathway in epithelial morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97019">SIRT2-mediated ACSS2 K271 deacetylation suppresses lipogenesis under nutrient stress</a></h4>

              
                De novo lipogenesis is associated with the development of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and obesity. At the core of lipogenesis lies acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), a metabolite that plays a crucial role in fatty acid synthesis. One of the pathways contributing to the production of cytosolic acetyl-CoA is mediated by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). Here, we reveal that when cells encounter nutrient stress, particularly a deficiency in amino acids, Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) catalyzes the deacetylation of ACSS2 at the lysine residue K271. This results in K271 ubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation of ACSS2. Substitution of K271 leads to decreased ubiquitination of ACSS2, increased ACSS2 protein level, and thus increased lipogenesis. Our study uncovers a mechanism that cells employ to efficiently manage lipogenesis during periods of nutrient stress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105977">MARK2 regulates Golgi apparatus reorientation by phosphorylation of CAMSAP2 in directional cell migratio</a></h4>

              
                The reorientation of the Golgi apparatus is crucial for cell migration and is regulated by multipolarity signals. A number of non-centrosomal microtubules anchor at the surface of the Golgi apparatus and play a vital role in the Golgi reorientation, but how the Golgi are regulated by polarity signals remains unclear. Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) is a protein that anchors microtubules to the Golgi, a cellular organelle. Our research indicates that CAMSAP2 is dynamically localized at the Golgi during its reorientation processing. Further research shows that CAMSAP2 is potentially regulated by a polarity signaling molecule called MARK2, which interacts with CAMSAP2. We used mass spectrometry to find that MARK2 phosphorylates CAMSAP2 at serine-835, which affects its interaction with the Golgi-associated protein USO1 but not with CG-NAP or CLASPs. This interaction is critical for anchoring microtubules to the Golgi during cell migration, altering microtubule polarity distribution, and aiding Golgi reorientation. Our study reveals an important signaling pathway in Golgi reorientation during cell migration, which can provide insights for research in cancer cell migration, immune response, and targeted drug development.

">Neural dynamics of an extended frontal lobe network in goal-subgoal problem solving</a></h4>

              
                Complex behavior calls for hierarchical representation of current state, goal, and component moves. In the human brain, a network of "multiple-demand" (MD) regions underpins cognitive control. We recorded from four putative homologs to human MD regions in the frontal lobe - ventrolateral (vlPFC), dorsomedial (dmPFC), dorsal premotor (dPM) and insula/orbitofrontal (I/O) cortex - as monkeys solved an on-screen spatial maze. Across regions there was wide variation in strength of encoding task features. Sensory input and current state were strongly coded in vlPFC, goal most stably in dmPFC, and move most rapidly in vlPFC and dPM. I/O responded during revision of a prepared route. Across regions, an abstract, hierarchical code of problem structure marked progress from problem start to end. We suggest that, across an extended frontal network, partially separated but widely reproduced codes build the structured control program of organized behavior.

">Synergistic short-term synaptic plasticity mechanisms for working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is essential for almost every cognitive task and behavior. The neural and synaptic mechanisms supporting the rapid encoding and maintenance of memories in diverse tasks are the subject of an ongoing debate. The traditional view of WM as stationary persistent firing of selective neuronal populations has given room to newer ideas regarding mechanisms that support a more dynamic maintenance of multiple items, which may also tolerate more activity disruption. Various computational WM models based on different biologically plausible synaptic and neural plasticity mechanisms have been proposed. We show that these proposed short-term plasticity mechanisms may not necessarily be competing explanations, but instead yield interesting functional interactions on a wide set of WM tasks and enhance the biological plausibility of spiking neural network models, in particular of the underlying synaptic plasticity. While monolithic models (WM function explained by one particular mechanism) are theoretically appealing and have increased our understanding of specific mechanisms, they are narrow explanations. WM models need to become more capable, robust and flexible to account for new experimental evidence of bursty and activity-silent multi-item maintenance in more challenging WM tasks, and generally solve more than one particular task. More detailed models also allow for electrophysiological constraints from recordings. In this study we evaluate the interactions between three commonly used classes of plasticity, namely intrinsic excitability, synaptic facilitation/augmentation and Hebbian plasticity. Combinations of these are systematically tested in a spiking neural network model on a broad suite of tasks or functional motifs deemed principally important for WM operation, such as one-shot encoding, free and cued recall, delay maintenance and updating. In our evaluation we focus on the operational task performance and biological plausibility. Our results indicate that a composite model, combining several commonly proposed plasticity mechanisms for WM function, is superior to more reductionist variants. Importantly, we attribute the observable differences to the principle nature of specific types of plasticity.

">Lateralised modulation of posterior alpha oscillations by closed loop auditory stimulation during memory retention</a></h4>

              
                Alpha oscillations have been implicated in the maintenance of working memory representations. Notably, when memorised content is spatially lateralised, the power of posterior alpha activity exhibits corresponding lateralisation during the retention interval, consistent with the retinotopic organisation of the visual cortex. Beyond power, alpha frequency has also been linked to memory performance, with faster alpha rhythms associated with enhanced retention. These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS), and leveraging the phase-dependent responsiveness of alpha oscillations to sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices. The extent of induced frequency lateralisation was associated with the behavioural asymmetry in task performance.

                Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate all projection neurons (PNs) in the cerebral cortex through incompletely understood processes. Herein, we combine Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM)-based clonal analysis at embryonic days 12.5 and 13.5 with early postnatal callosal tracing to reveal a lineage progression that challenges the inside-outside model of cortical development and the conventional view of an invariable sequence of asymmetric neurogenic divisions. Our data demonstrate that early multipotent RGPs generate all extra-telencephalic (ET) and intra-telencephalic (IT) PNs across all layers through parallel sublineages and the random specification, during the earliest neurogenic divisions, of fate-restricted daughter RGPs. While the neuronal production of the parental multipotent RGPs consists of small ET-PN or IT-PN outputs, fate-restricted RGPs produce larger translaminar outputs spanning deep and upper layers of only IT-PNs, the predominant mammalian PN subtype. We further show that the emergence of IT-PN fate-restricted RGPs also leads to quantitatively and temporally stereotyped neurogenesis population-wise.

                How exactly does general anesthesia achieve its effects? It is so widely used in surgeries and medical treatments to enhance comfort for nearly one hundred years, yet its precise mechanisms underlying the loss and recovery of consciousness still remain unclear. Utilizing a variety of research methods- pharmacological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, fiber photometry, and gene knockdown approaches- our study has shed light on the significant modulatory function of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons during the transition from sevoflurane anesthesia to awakening. Furthermore, the activation of the LC-mPFC circuit has been found to have a substantial arousal effect, with 1-AR playing a crucial role in this process. Additionally, GABAA-R has been identified as the key binding site for sevoflurane within the locus coeruleus. These findings collectively offer novel insights into the neural network mechanisms underlying general anesthesia, advancing our understanding of this

                We investigated ketamine's neuroplastic effects in healthy human subjects using integrated Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measures before and 1-8 days after a single psychedelic dose of ketamine (1 mg/kg, intravenous). Eleven participants underwent two PET/MRI scans with [11C]-UCBJ (synaptic density/plasticity), 1H-MRS (Glutamate and GABA), and resting-state fMRI (intrinsic brain activity, functional connectivity, graph-theoretic metrics), before and after ketamine. While group-level analyses showed only trend-level increases in PET synaptic markers, we observed significantly elevated Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) glutamate levels post-ketamine. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased within-network integrity, particularly in high-order networks like the default mode network (DMN), alongside increased low-to-high-order network integration. Our multimodal analysis showed that increased [11C]-UCBJ volume distribution (VT), a putative index of synaptic plasticity, correlated with reduced intrinsic activity in DMN regions and decreased influence of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in global network dynamics. By linking molecular and network-level changes, our results point to the PCC as a central hub where ketamine may reshape brain hierarchies in the long term, providing new directions for understanding its therapeutic mechanisms and developing targeted treatments.

                Defect in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) underlies a rare intellectual disability disorder, Kabuki Syndrome (KS). We show that in addition to reduction in post-natal neurogenesis, KS mice present small, arrested hippocampal microglia which single cell RNA sequence analyses revealed as globally downregulated, occupying neither activated nor surveillance states. Weekly administration of a triple combination formulation (TCF) containing the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, HPBCD and PEG-400 for three months, boosted microglia. Transcriptomic, pseudotime cell trajectory analyses, imaging and behavioral data suggest that TCF differentiated KS microglia from arrested to non-diseased and non-activated surveillance forms by selective acetylation of histone H3, that restored the open chromatin mark H3K4me3 independent of Kmt2D, to improve cognitive and nociceptive responses. Wild-type microglia showed no substantial transcriptional or histone changes, intimating normal heterochromatin resisted TCF. These findings reveal a novel chromatin-mediated mechanism of microglial differentiation uncoupled from activation, with therapeutic potential for KS and related disorders.

                Background In all animals, the nervous system senses microbial signals to influence host defense. Despite emerging as important sensors of infection to regulate immunity and inflammation, the mechanisms by which pain-sensing nociceptor neurons can detect infections are poorly defined. Using C. elegans as a tractable model host that shares many features with mammalian systems, we investigated nociceptor function during bacterial infection. Results In vivo intracellular Ca2+ imaging of nociceptor ASH neurons revealed a drastic reduction in ASH responses to aversive stimuli in Staphylococcus aureus-infected animals compared to noninfected controls. Morphological examination showed that the ASH neurons lost integrity in the sensory processes that extend to the mouth, in a pathogen growth phase-dependent manner. Neighboring neurons did not exhibit this pathogen-induced neurodegeneration (PaIN) phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy are dispensable for the PaIN phenotype. In contrast, loss of the evolutionarily conserved stress-response transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB reduced the penetrance of ASH PaIN by about 50%. Moreover, infected animals showed defective ASH-mediated evasive behaviors, suggesting that the S. aureus-triggered drop in ASH activation and morphological degeneration are physiologically relevant. Conclusions Collectively, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons lose functional and morphological integrity during infection with S. aureus, with severe consequences for animal behavior. Because S. aureus is a critical human pathogen, the induction of nociceptor PaIN may have important implications for human health.

">Alzheimer's disease risk gene Wwox protects against amyloid pathology through metabolic reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Genome wide association studies have identified multiple loci that mediate the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD). The gene WW-domain containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) has been identified in recent LOAD risk meta-analyses, yet its function in the brain is poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we discovered that knockdown of the highly conserved Wwox gene impacts longevity and sleep, having roles in both neuronal and glial subtypes. In an amyloid beta 42 (A{beta}42) transgenic model of AD, RNAi- mediated knockdown of Wwox significantly decreased both lifespan and locomotion whilst elevating soluble A{beta}42. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that these effects were accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) mRNA and lactate levels, downstream of an increase in the key unfolded protein response protein Atf4. Strikingly, we found that upregulation of Wwox in the A{beta}42 model through CRISPR activation significantly reduced amyloid load, improved longevity and locomotion. Multi-omics analysis revealed Wwox upregulation partially reversed several key A{beta}42-induced transcriptional pathways in the brain and reduced levels of L-methionine and associated enzymes. These findings support a role for reduced WWOX levels in the genetic risk of developing LOAD via pyruvate metabolism and point towards WWOX activation as a protective therapeutic strategy.

                Vasopressin, a key molecular regulator of social behavior, is implicated in promoting self-protective responses to threats against physical safety and resources. However, its role in defending against self-view threat, common in social interactions and critical to well-being, remains unclear. This study investigates the neural mechanisms through which vasopressin modulates self-protective responses to spontaneous social comparison. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled neuroimaging experiment, participants rated their satisfaction with social evaluations and monetary outcomes assigned to a stranger, friend, or themselves. Compared to placebo, vasopressin selectively intensified contrastive emotional responses to social evaluations of the stranger, decreasing satisfaction with positive evaluations and increasing satisfaction with negative evaluations, relative to those of the self or friend. At the neural level, vasopressin reduced the distinctions between the stranger and the self/friend in the medial prefrontal cortex activity, multivariate response patterns, and functional connectivity with the temporoparietal junction and precuneus, with this effect being especially pronounced among socially dominant individuals. These converging neuroimaging findings support the hypothesis that vasopressin alters the neural representation of the stranger, shifting it from a socially irrelevant figure under placebo to a psychologically salient competitor, thereby triggering self-protective emotional processes. These findings elucidate novel neuropsychological mechanisms through which vasopressin amplifies emotional defense against social threats and offer insights into potential clinical applications for psychiatric conditions characterized by impaired self-protection.

">Chronic nicotine treatment enhanced cognition and reduced neuroinflammation in the gp120 transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Antiretroviral development has improved the longevity of people with HIV (PWH), but many experience impaired cognition potentially due to neuroinflammation. PWH smoke cigarettes at higher rates than the general population, possibly for self medication given cognitive-enhancing and anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine, the primary psychoactive ingredient cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that chronic nicotine would improve cognition in a mouse model of HIV, gp120 transgenic (Tg) mice, and reduce neuroinflammation. Methods: Male and female gp120 Tg mice (n=64) and littermate controls (n=67) were operantly trained then tested for effortful motivation in the progressive ratio breakpoint task (PRBT). Mice were counter-balanced into three groups for saline or nicotine minipump implantation (0, 14 or 40 mg/kg/day) then retested 25 days later in the PRBT, probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT; reinforcement learning and cognitive flexibility), and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; risk-based decision-making), with a subset tested for neuroinflammation (Iba1 levels). Results: Gp120-Tg mice exhibited worse PRLT performance, attenuated by nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine selectively optimized their response strategies in the PRLT and IGT, increasing loss sensitivity, shifting animals towards safer responses. No motivation effects were observed. Nicotine also reduced Iba1 expression, suggesting that its cognitive-enhancing effects may relate to reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Gp120 Tg mice exhibited deficits in the PRLT, which are attenuated by chronic nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine improved reinforcement learning and risky decision-making supporting its therapeutic potential for cognitive deficits in PWH, possibly via reducing neuroinflammation. With potential negative consequences of long-term nicotine use, future studies should determine its mechanism of action to develop more targeted therapeutics.

">A mouse model of hemochromatosis-related mutations with brain iron dyshomeostasis exhibits loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression in dopaminergic neurons and motor control impairment relevant to Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                UK Biobank studies show Parkinson''s disease (PD) risk is almost doubled in men homozygous for the homeostatic iron regulator gene HFE p.C282Y polymorphism, associated with the common genetic iron disorder hemochromatosis. Whether this relationship is causal or spurious is unknown. We previously reported a novel Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mouse model of hemochromatosis with elevated brain iron (~1.5-1.8x). We now show these mice have reduced substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase expression at 3 months and 9 months age, sometimes exhibit severe hindlimb clasping by 7-8 months, have impaired rotarod and balance beam performance at 9 months and are untestable on the pole test. These parkinsonian features place the model at the forefront of genetic mouse models of PD, which generally do not show both TH loss and motor impairment. This confirms hemochromatosis-related mutations can cause parkinsonian features, substantiating causality of epidemiological relationships. Despite total brain iron elevation, neuronal iron remains low in Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mice, consistent with hemochromatosis-related mutations disrupting the normal, iron-responsive regulation of the neuronal iron exporter ferroportin by hepcidin. Parkinsonian features may reflect reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC) activity due to functional neuronal iron depletion. This may be exacerbated by indiscriminate chelation and could instead respond to drugs targeting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis or MRC activity. This new model of chronic parkinsonism that increases with age provides unprecedented insights into the complex relationships of brain iron regulation and movement impairment. Since parkinsonism of diverse etiologies can exhibit iron dysregulation, the model may facilitate pre-clinical to end-stage studies relevant to both sporadic and genetic PD.

">Anxiety state-related task disengagement varies with trait anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Cognitively demanding tasks are often perceived as costly due to the cognitive control resources they require, leading to effort avoidance, particularly in psychiatric populations with motivational impairments. Research on anxiety and cognitive effort are mixed: some studies suggest anxiety increases the perceived effort cost and avoidance, while others indicate that cognitive effort engagement can serve as an adaptive coping strategy. To reconcile these perspectives, we examined the interaction between state and trait anxiety on cognitive effort evaluation and engagement in two experiments. We hypothesized that state anxiety enhances task engagement as difficulty increases, and that this effect is diminished in individuals with high trait anxiety. Experiment 1 assessed self-reported anxiety in an online sample, while Experiment 2 manipulated state anxiety through autobiographical recall. Both experiments employed flow induction and effort discounting paradigms. Across both studies, the effect of state anxiety on task engagement depended on trait anxiety, but the direction of the state anxiety effect was opposite to the effect we predicted. In Experiment 1, participants with low trait anxiety reported reduced task engagement, as indexed by lower flow scores, when state anxiety was higher, but only in easy tasks. This effect was attenuated in participants with higher trait anxiety. The same pattern was observed in Experiment 2, but this time the interaction between trait and state anxiety was present regardless of task difficulty. These findings suggest that trait anxiety may reflect reduced impact of state anxiety on task disengagement.

">Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available EEG data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main Results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.

">Adaptive learning of a naturalistic bimanual task in virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Traditional motor adaptation studies often use constrained tasks that limit natural movement strategies. Using virtual reality, we studied people performing a realistic bimanual plate-lifting task while learning to account for a visual gain distortion applied to the right hand. We measured adaptation of early hand speed and the final plate position in three task conditions: bimanual lifting to a narrow target, unimanual lifting to a narrow target, and bimanual lifting to a wide target. As in previous studies, both hands initially adjusted to the distortion in bimanual conditions. But ultimately only the right hand adapted its speed and showed after-effects, contrasting prior reports. Contrary to our expectation, participants did not adapt early speed more when using one versus two hands. When we widened the target zone, participants achieved greater success in final plate position without reducing adaptation of early speed. Finally, both bimanual groups used a strategy of tilting the plate to be successful and showed no after-effects in final plate position when the distortion was removed. In contrast, the unimanual group did not tilt the plate and did show after-effects in final plate position. These findings reveal that in naturalistic tasks, people leverage multiple movement strategies to achieve goals. Overall, our findings support established principles of adaptation but also challenge expectations derived from more constrained motor learning paradigms, highlighting the importance of studying motor learning in more naturalistic contexts.

">Anticipated action goals structure spatial organisation in visual working memory following self-movement</a></h4>

              
                Working memory enables the retention of relevant visual information in service of anticipated behaviour. Consequently, the goal for which information is retained may crucially sculpt the way we retain and organise information in visual working memory. Here, we investigated how anticipated action goals structure the spatial organisation used for visual working memory following self movement. Participants encoded two tilted objects (left and right) in working memory, then turned around 180 degrees before being cued to either reproduce the tilt of the cued object from memory (report session) or manually reach back to it (reach session). The 180-degree self-movement uniquely enabled us to oppose and disentangle two potential spatial frames for immersive working memory in moving participants: the native spatial frame of how the objects were registered during encoding and an updated spatial frame keeping track where the objects are in the external world behind the participant after self-movement. Behavioural memory reports and spatial biases in gaze converged on the use of distinct spatial frames in the two tasks. This reveals how a foundational aspect of working memory in behaving humans - the spatial frame used to organise memories following self movement - is critically sculpted by anticipated action goals.

">Vitamin D regulates olfactory function via dual transcriptional and mTOR-dependent translational control of synaptic proteins</a></h4>

              
                Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency, affecting over 1 billion people worldwide, is associated with neurological dysfunction, but its cell-type-specific neural mechanisms remain unclear. Using a dietary mouse model, we show that VitD bidirectionally regulates olfactory acuity: deficiency impairs odor discrimination, while supplementation enhances sensitivity. Single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics pinpoint selective vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in olfactory bulb (OB) tufted cells, where it drives synaptic protein expression. Genetic VDR knockdown replicates deficiency-associated olfactory deficits, establishing VDR as essential for synaptic and translational regulation. Notably, we identify mTOR-mediated protein synthesis as a critical convergence point pharmacological mTOR inhibition (rapamycin) rescues synaptic protein deficits and behavioral impairments in VitD-deficient mice. These findings delineate a noncanonical VDR-mTOR-translational axis complementing conventional transcriptional regulation through which VitD serves as a nutrient-sensitive neuromodulator that integrates dietary status with synaptic functions and sensory processing. Our study expands the physiological role of VitD beyond traditional endocrine signaling and reveals mechanistic insights that may inform novel therapeutic strategies for neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with VitD deficiency.

">Oxysterol Alterations in SOD1G93A ALS Rats: 25-Hydroxycholesterol and LPS-Binding Protein in Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disruptions in cholesterol and oxysterol metabolism, along with neuroinflammation, are linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Given evidence of increased intestinal permeability in ALS, we investigated its link to neuroinflammation and oxysterol alterations in SOD1G93A rats. Methods: Oxysterols were quantified in plasma and spinal cord from presymptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A rats and age-matched controls via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Circulating LBP, a marker of intestinal permeability, was quantified via ELISA. Results: Oxysterols involved in bile acid biosynthesis - 7-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), and 3{beta}-hydroxycholestenoic acid - were increased in the plasma of symptomatic rats. The neuronal oxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-OH) decreased in the spinal cord but increased in the plasma. In contrast, 27-OH and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) levels were elevated in both plasma and spinal cord, with 25-OH rising during the presymptomatic stage. Presymptomatic animals also exhibited elevated LBP levels, which strongly correlated with spinal cord 25-OH levels, suggesting a link between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in ALS. Conclusion: Oxysterol alterations in plasma and spinal cord suggest compromised blood-spinal cord barrier integrity and early neuroinflammation. Elevated LBP levels indicate increased intestinal permeability and circulating LPS as contributors to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These findings highlight 25-OH and LBP as markers and mediators of gut-brain axis interactions in ALS pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic phase.

">Summation of contrast across the visual field: a common "fourth root" rule holds from the fovea to the periphery</a></h4>

              
                Increasing the area of a grating stimulus tends to reduce the contrast at which it can be detected. We can use the relationship between stimulus area and this "threshold" contrast to study the detection process. Contrast signals combine linearly over short distances, as if summed within the receptive fields that define the inputs to early visual neurons. Beyond this range, the effects of area summation decrease. We set out to find whether the relationship between stimulus area and threshold is the same across the visual field. We measured thresholds for detecting "tiger tail" strips of grating (that grow orthogonal to the major axis of those presumed early receptive fields) in the fovea, parafovea (3 deg), and periphery (10.5 deg). The interpretation of previous studies taking similar approaches has been complicated by the variation in local contrast sensitivity across the visual field. In our study, we have mapped a detailed "Witch Hat" attenuation surface of this inhomogeneity for our three participants. We used this both in our model to account for the results, as well as to generate "compensated" stimuli that are equally detectable at each location within the stimulus extent. Our results follow a common fourth root summation rule in the fovea, parafovea, and periphery. Our "noisy energy" model predicts this behaviour through a combination of: i) the Witch Hat surface, ii) linear filtering by receptive fields that mimic those of V1 simple cells, iii) square-law contrast transduction, and iv) the application of an internal template that devotes the participant's attention to the extent of the stimulus. Fitting this model with one global sensitivity parameter (per participant) accounts for the foveal and parafoveal data (56 thresholds), with one further parameter allowing us to also model the periphery (84 thresholds).

Healthy adults stood wearing a VR headset that presented two interleaved adaptive staircases of virtual sinusoidal pitch rotation about the ankle axis. In separate conditions of randomly ordered blocks, subjects were asked to indicate (yes/no) if the room moved (regardless of perceived postural sway) or if their postural sway increased (regardless of perceived room motion). Head sway area was measured by tracking movement of the VR headset. Binary response data were fit with psychometric curves to determine points of subjective equality (PSEs) for room motion and postural sway. PSEs were compared between conditions. Effects of motion perception (binary responses) on head sway area before, during, and after visual stimulation were examined. The mean PSE for room motion (0.42 degrees) was significantly lower than for postural sway (2.02 degrees) [t(1,18) = 4.4714, p = 0.00029]. Head sway area was significantly larger during (z = 11.53, p < 0.001) and after (z = 5.09, p < 0.001) visual stimulation only when participants perceived increased postural sway. Nearly 5-fold greater amplitudes of oscillating VR visual stimuli were required to induce perceptions of altered self- versus visual field motion. Accurate perceptions of head motion relative to observed head sway were found only when participants focused internally on self-motion, not externally on room motion.

">Large Reaching Datasets Quantify the Impact of Age, Sex/Gender, and Experience on Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                As we age, our movements become slower and less precise - but the extent of this decline remains unclear. To address this, we harmonized data from 2,185 participants across four published studies using a standard center-out reaching task. We found that older age was associated with a steady decline in reaction time (-1.2 ms/year), movement time (-2.3 ms/year), and movement precision (-0.02{degrees}/year). Although the rate of decline did not differ by sex/gender, females consistently reacted more slowly (-8 ms), moved more slowly (-37 ms), and exhibited greater precision (+0.5{degrees}) across the adult lifespan. Notably, sex/gender differences attenuated after accounting for experiential factors such as video game use and the amount of sleep per day, whereas age remained a robust and consistent predictor of motor decline. Together, these findings provide a large-scale quantification of age, sex/gender, and experiential effects on motor control, offering a normative benchmark to inform future clinical interventions aimed at preserving motor function across the lifespan.

">Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 m pixel size. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material - doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 m. Approach. To fit within a few m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M{Omega} range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few hundred k{Omega}/sq, which translates to resistivity of a few {Omega}*cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main Results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M{Omega} on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A/W, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21-31% when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54-55% decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16-22% with no shunt to 22-34% with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a MOhm range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100 m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.

">Decoding of frequency modulated sweeps by core and belt neurons in the alert macaque auditory cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Acoustic stimuli where the spectrum is time-varying are ubiquitous in natural sounds, including animal vocalizations, human speech, and music. Early studies of such stimuli involving frequency-modulated sweeps revealed that neurons in the primary auditory cortex of a variety of mammals show differences in firing rates depending on either the direction of the sweep and/or the sweep velocity. Psychophysical studies have also shown that the perception of such time-varying stimulus parameters is quite acute, underscoring the importance of such signals in normal acoustic perception. Surprisingly, the responses of auditory neurons in alert primates has been little studied, and we have limited information relating neural activity to the perception of these signals. In this study, we investigated the neural discriminability of sweep direction and velocity for frequency-modulated sweeps presented to alert rhesus macaque monkeys in both core and belt auditory cortical areas. We quantified how well these information-bearing parameters were encoded using spike train pattern discriminators, and compared decoder performance when neural responses were restricted to temporal patterns or firing rates. Decoding accuracy for firing rate alone exceeded chance, and rate-normalized, spike-timing information was essentially equivalent to the complete firing pattern. Although most belt areas showed small decreases in decoding accuracy relative to the primary field, all fields encoded and represented sweeps similarly. Thus, there was little evidence of hierarchical processing between core and belt fields for these stimuli, indicating that frequency modulation sweep direction and velocity are not specifically extracted in the early auditory cortical hierarchy.

">Caspase cleavage of APP contributes to amyloid beta-protein induced synaptic injury</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid beta (Abeta) lies at the center of Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathology and that synapses are the initial site of damage by Abeta. Recent studies have also indicated a role for caspases in AD-related synaptic dysfunction and memory loss, but the mechanism(s) through which the caspases act remains elusive. Previous studies in cell culture indicate that cleavage of a caspase site on the intracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein contributes to Abeta-induced cell death. However, the role of this cleavage event in synaptic dysfunction has not been established. METHODS: Through a combination of intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological methods and confocal microscopy of dendritic spines, we examined the involvement of caspase-3 and amyloid-precursor protein in Abeta-mediated synaptic dysfunction. RESULTS: Here, we provide evidence that caspase activity at the intracellular domain of APP is required for acute Abeta-induced depression of glutamatergic synapses. We find that local elevation of Abeta levels through over-expression of the C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) failed to depress synapses if caspases were inhibited pharmacologically or in tissue lacking caspase-3. To demonstrate a link between these findings to APP, we found that Abeta-failed to depress synaptic transmission or inhibit synaptic plasticity in neurons lacking APP. To specifically test the role of caspase cleavage of the intracellular domain of APP, we introduced a mutation that inhibits caspase cleavage at site 664 to the C99 construct; this construct produced Abeta but failed to elicit Abeta-induced synaptic depression or spine loss, and reduced caspase-3 activity. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest an APP-dependent pathway in which caspases contribute to Abeta-induced synaptic depression and spine loss via cleavage of APP.

">PW-GAN: Pseudo-Warping Field Guided GAN for Unsupervised Denoising of Fetal Brain MRI Images</a></h4>

              
                Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging is of great importance for prenatal neural disorder diagnosis. To improve signal-to-noise ratio and coverage, fetal brain MRI often uses thick-slice scanning to reduce motion artifacts and ensure image quality for single slices. Reconstructing 3D MR volumes from multiple motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices has shown promise in imaging of moving subjects like fetal MRI. However, raw scans acquired with varying slice thicknesses present substantial disparities in quality when retrospectively reconstructed into isotropic high-resolution volumes (e.g. 0.8 mm slice thickness). In particular, thick-slice acquisitions (e.g. 5-6 mm) tend to yield suboptimal reconstruction results compared to thin-slice scans (e.g. 2-3 mm), often exhibiting residual noise, interpolation-induced artifacts, and inter-slice structural discontinuities. This challenge has highlighted the need to further reduce noise caused by reconstruction errors when the reconstructed volumes are used for downstream tasks. With the success of neural networks in computer vision, deep learning methods based on architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved outstanding performance in single-image denoising. Nevertheless, CNN-based methods still heavily rely on large-scale datasets comprising noisy-clean image pairs. Although unsupervised GAN variants such as CycleGAN have been developed to mitigate this dependency, the inherent variability of GAN-generated outputs often results in tiny anatomical distortions, significantly limiting the applicability of GAN-based methods. While several approaches have introduced regularizations to address this issue, they largely focus on denoising individual slices, overlooking inter-slice structural inconsistencies that arise from treating slices independently. In this work, we propose Pseudo-Warping Field Guided Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (PW-GAN), which formulates post-reconstruction optimization as an unpaired style transfer problem between low-quality and high-quality MRI domains. Moreover, by incorporating a pseudo-deformation field module based on optical flow estimation, our method significantly enhances inter-slice continuity in the reconstructed volumes while effectively suppressing residual noise and interpolation artifacts introduced during the reconstruction process. Evaluations on both simulated and in vivo data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised models and achieves performance on par with several state-of-the-art supervised methods.

">Acute Administration of Oxytocin in the Functional Recovery of Neurocognitive and Social Deficits Following Juvenile Frontal Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Juvenile traumatic brain injury (jTBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in children. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is most susceptible to injury which leads to deficits in executive function, social behaviors, and cognitive flexibility. Prior research has shown a significant role of the oxytocin (OXT) system in the modulation of social behaviors, and that intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) is potentially neuroprotective. Therefore, we believe IN-OXT could improve behavioral deficits caused by a PFC injury. Methods: Animals received a single midline cortical contusion bilaterally damaging the medial PFC (mPFC) and immediately given a single dose of IN-OXT, placebo, or no treatment. Animals were assessed using behavioral and histological measures. Results: The results indicated that IN-OXT in jTBI animals mildly improved spatial learning but did not improve spatial memory. Additionally, TBI increased social dominance behavior, but IN-OXT did not mitigate those behaviors. IN-OXT did not alleviate neuroinflammation but did elevate OXT receptors and OXT peptide levels. Furthermore, TBI decreased OXT in the SON of the hypothalamus, and IN-OXT returned OXT levels in this region to normal. Discussion: These results show that IN-OXT increases OXT levels in the brain via pathways originating in the SON and improved spatial learning.
