              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MKK6 deficiency promotes cardiac dysfunction through MKK3-p38γ/δ-mTOR hyperactivation</a></h4>

              
                Stress-activated p38 kinases control a plethora of functions, and their dysregulation has been linked to the development of steatosis, obesity, immune disorders, and cancer. Therefore, they have been identified as potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. There are four p38 family members (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) that are activated by MKK3 and MKK6. Here, we demonstrate that lack of MKK6 reduces the lifespan in mice. Longitudinal study of cardiac function in MKK6 KO mice showed that young mice develop cardiac hypertrophy which progresses to cardiac dilatation and fibrosis with age. Mechanistically, lack of MKK6 blunts p38α activation while causing MKK3-p38γ/δ hyperphosphorylation and increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6 KO mice is reverted by knocking out either p38γ or p38δ or by inhibiting the mTOR pathway with rapamycin. In conclusion, we have identified a key role for the MKK3/6-p38γ/δ pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which has important implications for the clinical use of p38α inhibitors in the long-term treatment since they might result in cardiotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Earliest evidence for fruit consumption and potential seed dispersal by birds</a></h4>

              
                The Early Cretaceous diversification of birds was a major event in the history of terrestrial ecosystems, occurring during the earliest phase of the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, long before the origin of the bird crown-group. Frugivorous birds play an important role in seed dispersal today. However, evidence of fruit consumption in early birds from outside the crown-group has been lacking. <i>Jeholornis</i> is one of the earliest-diverging birds, only slightly more crownward than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, but its cranial anatomy has been poorly understood, limiting trophic information which may be gleaned from the skull. Originally hypothesised to be granivorous based on seeds preserved as gut contents, this interpretation has become controversial. We conducted high-resolution synchrotron tomography on an exquisitely preserved new skull of <i>Jeholornis</i>, revealing remarkable cranial plesiomorphies combined with a specialised rostrum. We use this to provide a near-complete cranial reconstruction of <i>Jeholornis</i>, and exclude the possibility that <i>Jeholornis</i> was granivorous, based on morphometric analyses of the mandible (3D) and cranium (2D), and comparisons with the 3D alimentary contents of extant birds. We show that <i>Jeholornis</i> provides the earliest evidence for fruit consumption in birds, and indicates that birds may have been recruited for seed dispersal during the earliest stages of the avian radiation. As mobile seed dispersers, early frugivorous birds could have expanded the scope for biotic dispersal in plants, and might therefore explain, at least in part, the subsequent evolutionary expansion of fruits, indicating a potential role of bird–plant interactions in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution.

	<p>Speakers design communication for their audience, providing more information in both speech and gesture when their listener is na&amp;amp;iuml;ve to the topic. We test whether the hippocampal declarative memory system contributes to multimodal audience design. The hippocampus, while traditionally linked to episodic and relational memory, has also been linked to the ability to imagine the mental states of others and use language flexibly. We examined the speech and gesture use of four patients with hippocampal amnesia when describing how to complete everyday tasks (e.g., how to tie a shoe) to an imagined child listener and an adult listener. Although patients with amnesia did not increase their total number of words and instructional steps for the child listener, they did produce representational gestures at significantly higher rates for the imagined child compared to the adult listener. They also gestured at similar frequencies to neurotypical peers, suggesting that hand gesture can be a meaningful communicative resource, even in the case of severe declarative memory impairment. We discuss the contributions of multiple memory systems to multimodal audience design and the potential of gesture to act as a window into the social cognitive processes of individuals with neurologic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Behaviour test in chronic brain ischemia rats: A bibliometric approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke causes severe disability and mortality. Despite the fact that the pathology of acute stroke is well understood, publication on chronic stroke is still limited. Because scarring of glia limits the recovery area of acute stroke and reorganization capacity is reduced, discovering new treatments for chronic stroke poses substantial obstacles. In stroke research, rodent models are commonly utilized, and behavior testing is a crucial tool.  To measure stroke outcomes and translating rodent findings to therapeutic trials, selecting relevant behavioral tests that fit the study purpose is critical. Here, we aimed to look at the last decade’s publications highlighting behaviour tests on chronic stroke rats. Hopefully, we were able to give more information about the behaviour tests to facilitate the researchers’ choice of appropriate test. Methods: By using a bibliometric analysis, we hope to systematically discuss rodent behavior tests in chronic stroke research. Documents were extracted from the Scopus database in April 2022. Excel and VOSviewer 1.6.18 were used to conduct statistical and graphical analysis. Results: Research on "behavioral test in chronic stroke rats" has progressed quickly, although the researchers have yet to collaborate with each other. H. Millani was an active researcher and author who connected numerous researchers, according to documents and citation analysis. “Animals”, “brain ischemia”, “man”, “publication”, and “animal experiment” were all common keywords. The majority of the articles were from the United States and China. The Morris Water Maze test and the cylinder test were the most commonly used behavior tests. Conclusions Clinical applications and therapeutic effectiveness against stroke could be improved with more collaboration amongst authors. When using a behavior test, researchers need to think about which neurological deficiency is being addressed and whether the test covers long-term evaluation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">iPiDA-LTR: Identifying piwi-interacting RNA-disease associations based on Learning to Rank</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenxiang Zhang, Jialu Hou, Bin Liu</p>

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are regarded as drug targets and biomarkers for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. However, biological experiments cost substantial time and resources, and the existing computational methods only focus on identifying missing associations between known piRNAs and diseases. With the fast development of biological experiments, more and more piRNAs are detected. Therefore, the identification of piRNA-disease associations of newly detected piRNAs has significant theoretical value and practical significance on pathogenesis of diseases. In this study, the iPiDA-LTR predictor is proposed to identify associations between piRNAs and diseases based on Learning to Rank. The iPiDA-LTR predictor not only identifies the missing associations between known piRNAs and diseases, but also detects diseases associated with newly detected piRNAs. Experimental results demonstrate that iPiDA-LTR effectively predicts piRNA-disease associations outperforming the other related methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing the variation in chromosome structure ensembles in the context of the nuclear microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Priyojit Das, Tongye Shen, Rachel Patton McCord</p>

Inside the nucleus, chromosomes are subjected to direct physical interaction between different components, active forces, and thermal noise, leading to the formation of an ensemble of three-dimensional structures. However, it is still not well understood to what extent and how the structural ensemble varies from one chromosome region or cell-type to another. We designed a statistical analysis technique and applied it to single-cell chromosome imaging data to reveal the heterogeneity of individual chromosome structures. By analyzing the resulting structural landscape, we find that the largest dynamic variation is the overall radius of gyration of the chromatin region, followed by domain reorganization within the region. By comparing different human cell-lines and experimental perturbation data using this statistical analysis technique and a network-based similarity quantification approach, we identify both cell-type and condition-specific features of the structural landscapes. We identify a relationship between epigenetic state and the properties of chromosome structure fluctuation and validate this relationship through polymer simulations. Overall, our study suggests that the types of variation in a chromosome structure ensemble are cell-type as well as region-specific and can be attributed to constraints placed on the structure by factors such as variation in epigenetic state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Consistent pattern of epidemic slowing across many geographies led to longer, flatter initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

To define appropriate planning scenarios for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, it is important to understand the initial transmission dynamics of COVID-19 during 2020. Here, we fit an age-stratified compartmental model with a flexible underlying transmission term to daily COVID-19 death data from states in the contiguous U.S. and to national and sub-national data from around the world. The daily death data of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic was qualitatively categorized into one of four main profile types: “spring single-peak”, “summer single-peak”, “spring/summer two-peak” and “broad with shoulder”. We estimated a reproduction number <i>R</i> as a function of calendar time <i>t</i><sub>c</sub> and as a function of time since the first death reported in that population (local pandemic time, <i>t</i><sub>p</sub>). Contrary to the diversity of categories and range of magnitudes in death incidence profiles, the <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) profiles were much more homogeneous. We found that in both the contiguous U.S. and globally, the initial value of both <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>c</sub>) and <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) was substantial: at or above two. However, during the early months, pandemic time <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) decreased exponentially to a value that hovered around one. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in the variance of <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>). For calendar time <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>c</sub>), the decrease in magnitude was slower and non-exponential, with a smaller reduction in variance. Intriguingly, similar trends of exponential decrease and reduced variance were not observed in raw death data. Our findings suggest that the combination of specific government responses and spontaneous changes in behaviour ensured that transmissibility dropped, rather than remaining constant, during the initial phases of a pandemic. Future pandemic planning scenarios should include models that assume similar decreases in transmissibility, which lead to longer epidemics with lower peaks when compared with models based on constant transmissibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regimes and mechanisms of transient amplification in abstract and biological neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Georgia Christodoulou, Tim P. Vogels, Everton J. Agnes</p>

Neuronal networks encode information through patterns of activity that define the networks’ function. The neurons’ activity relies on specific connectivity structures, yet the link between structure and function is not fully understood. Here, we tackle this structure-function problem with a new conceptual approach. Instead of manipulating the connectivity directly, we focus on upper triangular matrices, which represent the network dynamics in a given orthonormal basis obtained by the Schur decomposition. This abstraction allows us to independently manipulate the eigenspectrum and feedforward structures of a connectivity matrix. Using this method, we describe a diverse repertoire of non-normal transient amplification, and to complement the analysis of the dynamical regimes, we quantify the geometry of output trajectories through the effective rank of both the eigenvector and the dynamics matrices. Counter-intuitively, we find that shrinking the eigenspectrum’s imaginary distribution leads to highly amplifying regimes in linear and long-lasting dynamics in nonlinear networks. We also find a trade-off between amplification and dimensionality of neuronal dynamics, i.e., trajectories in neuronal state-space. Networks that can amplify a large number of orthogonal initial conditions produce neuronal trajectories that lie in the same subspace of the neuronal state-space. Finally, we examine networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We find that the strength of global inhibition is directly linked with the amplitude of amplification, such that weakening inhibitory weights also decreases amplification, and that the eigenspectrum’s imaginary distribution grows with an increase in the ratio between excitatory-to-inhibitory and excitatory-to-excitatory connectivity strengths. Consequently, the strength of global inhibition reveals itself as a strong signature for amplification and a potential control mechanism to switch dynamical regimes. Our results shed a light on how biological networks, i.e., networks constrained by Dale’s law, may be optimised for specific dynamical regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Terminal heterocyst differentiation in the Anabaena patA mutant as a result of post-transcriptional modifications and molecular leakage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pau Casanova-Ferrer, Saúl Ares, Javier Muñoz-García</p>

The <i>Anabaena</i> genus is a model organism of filamentous cyanobacteria whose vegetative cells can differentiate under nitrogen-limited conditions into a type of cell called heterocyst. These heterocysts lose the possibility to divide and are necessary for the colony because they can fix and share environmental nitrogen. In order to distribute the nitrogen efficiently, heterocysts are arranged to form a quasi-regular pattern whose features are maintained as the filament grows. Recent efforts have allowed advances in the understanding of the interactions and genetic mechanisms underlying this dynamic pattern. However, the main role of the <i>patA</i> and <i>hetF</i> genes are yet to be clarified; in particular, the <i>patA</i> mutant forms heterocysts almost exclusively in the terminal cells of the filament. In this work, we investigate the function of these genes and provide a theoretical model that explains how they interact within the broader genetic network, reproducing their knock-out phenotypes in several genetic backgrounds, including a nearly uniform concentration of HetR along the filament for the <i>patA</i> mutant. Our results suggest a role of <i>hetF</i> and <i>patA</i> in a post-transcriptional modification of HetR which is essential for its regulatory function. In addition, the existence of molecular leakage out of the filament in its boundary cells is enough to explain the preferential appearance of terminal heterocysts, without any need for a distinct regulatory pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Biased belief priors versus biased belief updating: Differential correlates of depression and anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Gagne, Sharon Agai, Christian Ramiro, Peter Dayan, Sonia Bishop</p>

Individuals prone to anxiety and depression often report beliefs and make judgements about themselves that are more negative than those reported by others. We use computational modeling of a richly naturalistic task to disentangle the role of negative priors versus negatively biased belief updating and to investigate their association with different dimensions of Internalizing psychopathology. Undergraduate participants first provided profiles for a hypothetical tech internship. They then viewed pairs of other profiles and selected the individual they would prefer to work alongside out of each pair. In a subsequent phase of the experiment, participants made judgments about their relative popularity as hypothetical internship partners both before any feedback and after each of 20 items of feedback revealing whether or not they had been selected as the preferred teammate from a given pairing. Scores on latent factors of general negative affect, anxiety-specific affect and depression-specific affect were estimated using participants’ self-report scores on standardized measures of anxiety and depression together with factor loadings from a bifactor analysis conducted previously. Higher scores on the depression-specific factor were linked to more negative prior beliefs but were not associated with differences in belief updating. In contrast, higher scores on the anxiety-specific factor were associated with a negative bias in belief updating but no difference in prior beliefs. These findings indicate that, to at least some extent, distinct processes may impact the formation of belief priors and in-the-moment belief updating and that these processes may be differentially disrupted in depression and anxiety. Future directions for enquiry include examination of the possibility that prior beliefs biases in depression might reflect generalization from prior experiences or global schema whereas belief updating biases in anxiety might be more situationally specific.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Apoptosis and tissue thinning contribute to symmetric cell division in the developing mouse epidermis in a nonautonomous way</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arad Soffer, Adnan Mahly, Krishnanand Padmanabhan, Jonathan Cohen, Orit Adir, Eidan Loushi, Yaron Fuchs, Scott E. Williams, Chen Luxenburg</p>

Mitotic spindle orientation (SO) is a conserved mechanism that governs cell fate and tissue morphogenesis. In the developing epidermis, a balance between self-renewing symmetric divisions and differentiative asymmetric divisions is necessary for normal development. While the cellular machinery that executes SO is well characterized, the extrinsic cues that guide it are poorly understood. Here, we identified the basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM), a β1 integrin coreceptor, as a novel regulator of epidermal morphogenesis. In utero RNAi-mediated depletion of <i>Bcam</i> in the mouse embryo did not hinder β1 integrin distribution or cell adhesion and polarity. However, <i>Bcam</i> depletion promoted apoptosis, thinning of the epidermis, and symmetric cell division, and the defects were reversed by concomitant overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor <i>Xiap</i>. Moreover, in mosaic epidermis, depletion of <i>Bcam</i> or <i>Xiap</i> induced symmetric divisions in neighboring wild-type cells. These results identify apoptosis and epidermal architecture as extrinsic cues that guide SO in the developing epidermis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Shoot-to-root translocated GmNN1/FT2a triggers nodulation and regulates soybean nitrogen nutrition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinxin Li, Huiwen Zhou, Ling Cheng, Niannian Ma, Baofeng Cui, Wenfei Wang, Yongjia Zhong, Hong Liao</p>

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) provides sufficient nitrogen (N) to meet most legume nutrition demands. In return, host plants feed symbionts carbohydrates produced in shoots. However, the molecular dialogue between shoots and symbionts remains largely mysterious. Here, we report the map-based cloning and characterization of a natural variation in <i>GmNN1</i>, the ortholog of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT2a</i>) that simultaneously triggers nodulation in soybean and modulates leaf N nutrition. A 43-bp insertion in the promoter region of <i>GmNN1/FT2a</i> significantly decreased its transcription level and yielded N deficiency phenotypes. Manipulating <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>GmFT2a</i> significantly enhanced soybean nodulation, plant growth, and N nutrition. The near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying low mRNA abundance alleles of <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>FT2a</i>, along with stable transgenic soybeans with CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts of <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>FT2a</i>, had yellower leaves, lower N concentrations, and fewer nodules than wild-type control plants. Grafting together with split-root experiments demonstrated that only shoot GmNN1/FT2a was responsible for regulating nodulation and thereby N nutrition through shoot-to-root translocation, and this process depends on rhizobial infection. After translocating into roots, shoot-derived GmNN1/FT2a was found to interact with GmNFYA-C (nuclear factor-Y subunit A-C) to activate symbiotic signaling through the previously reported GmNFYA-C-ENOD40 module. In short, the description of the critical soybean nodulation regulatory pathway outlined herein sheds novel insights into the shoot-to-root signaling required for communications between host plants and root nodulating symbionts.

                <p>by Quirine ten Bosch, Voahangy Andrianaivoarimanana, Beza Ramasindrazana, Guillain Mikaty, Rado JL Rakotonanahary, Birgit Nikolay, Soloandry Rahajandraibe, Maxence Feher, Quentin Grassin, Juliette Paireau, Soanandrasana Rahelinirina, Rindra Randremanana, Feno Rakotoarimanana, Marie Melocco, Voahangy Rasolofo, Javier Pizarro-Cerda, Anne-Sophie Le Guern, Eric Bertherat, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, André Spiegel, Laurence Baril, Minoarisoa Rajerison, Simon Cauchemez</p>

During outbreaks, the lack of diagnostic “gold standard” can mask the true burden of infection in the population and hamper the allocation of resources required for control. Here, we present an analytical framework to evaluate and optimize the use of diagnostics when multiple yet imperfect diagnostic tests are available. We apply it to laboratory results of 2,136 samples, analyzed with 3 diagnostic tests (based on up to 7 diagnostic outcomes), collected during the 2017 pneumonic (PP) and bubonic plague (BP) outbreak in Madagascar, which was unprecedented both in the number of notified cases, clinical presentation, and spatial distribution. The extent of these outbreaks has however remained unclear due to nonoptimal assays. Using latent class methods, we estimate that 7% to 15% of notified cases were <i>Yersinia pestis</i>-infected. Overreporting was highest during the peak of the outbreak and lowest in the rural settings endemic to <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. Molecular biology methods offered the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. The specificity of the rapid diagnostic test was relatively low (PP: 82%, BP: 85%), particularly for use in contexts with large quantities of misclassified cases. Comparison with data from a subsequent seasonal <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> outbreak in 2018 reveal better test performance (BP: specificity 99%, sensitivity: 91%), indicating that factors related to the response to a large, explosive outbreak may well have affected test performance. We used our framework to optimize the case classification and derive consolidated epidemic trends. Our approach may help reduce uncertainties in other outbreaks where diagnostics are imperfect.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative neurological disorder with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the potential biomarkers implicated in the occurrence and progression of AD prior to clinical testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We selected 119 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 147,827 European participants. Summary data about AD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis with 63,926 European individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of blood metabolites with AD, and a phenome-wide MR analysis was further applied to ascertain the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four metabolites were identified as causal mediators for AD, including epiandrosterone sulfate (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.71; <i>p</i> = 6.14 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate (OR per SD increase: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; <i>p</i> = 1.98 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), sphingomyelin (OR per SD increase: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78–3.59; <i>p</i> = 2.10 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and glutamine (OR per SD increase: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; <i>p</i> = 2.09 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Phenome-wide MR analysis showed that epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate and sphingomyelin mediated the risk of multiple diseases, and glutamine had beneficial effects on the risk of 4 diseases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted increased epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate, and glutamine might be associated with a decreased risk of AD, while sphingomyelin was associated with an increased risk. Side-effect profiles were characterized to help inform drug target prioritization, and glutamine might be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of AD with no predicted detrimental side effects.

                Background: HNP1, LL-37, and HBD1 are antimicrobial against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 at the standard inoculum but less active at higher inocula.   Methods: The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay was adapted for high inocula and the addition of yeast tRNA and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase).  96-well plates were read for 12 hours in a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader and photographed under 10x magnification.    Results: Adding tRNA 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum almost completely abrogated activity.  Adding RNase 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum of 5x105 CFU/mL did not enhance activity.  Increasing the inoculum to 6.25x107 CFU/mL almost abrogated HNP1 activity.  However, adding RNase 25:1 to HNP1 enhanced activity.  Adding both tRNA and RNase resulted in enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancement effect of RNase overwhelms the inhibiting effect of tRNA when both are present.  HBD1 activity at the standard inoculum was almost completely abrogated by the addition of tRNA, but LL-37 activity was only slightly inhibited by tRNA.  At the high inoculum, LL-37 activity was enhanced by RNase.  HBD1 activity was not enhanced by RNase.  RNase was not antimicrobial in the absence of antimicrobial peptides.  Cell clumps were observed at the high inoculum in the presence of all three antimicrobial peptides and at the standard inoculum in the presence of HNP1+tRNA.    Conclusions: Antimicrobial peptide-ribonuclease combinations have the potential to be active against high cell concentrations and biofilms, conditions where the antimicrobial agent alone is relatively ineffective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Penta-Helix Model of E-Government in Combating Corruption in Indonesia and Malaysia: Religiosity as a Moderating Role [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Septin‐5 & ‐7‐IgGs: Neurologic, Serologic & Pathophysiologic Characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background and objectives</h2>
<p>We sought to determine clinical significance of neuronal septin autoimmunity and evaluate for potential IgG effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA, mouse tissue and cell based) or western blot. IgG binding to (and internalization of) extracellular septin epitopes were evaluated for by live rat hippocampal neuron assay. The impact of purified patient IgGs on murine cortical neuron function was determined by recording extracellular field potentials in a multielectrode array platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were identified in 23 patients. All 8 patients with septin-5-IgG detected had cerebellar ataxia, 7 with prominent eye movement disorders. One of 2 with coexisting septin-7-IgG had additional psychiatric phenotype (apathy, emotional blunting and poor insight). Fifteen patients had septin-7 autoimmunity, without septin-5-IgG detected. Disorders included encephalopathy (11; 2 with accompanying myelopathy, 2 were relapsing), myelopathy (3) and episodic ataxia (1). Psychiatric symptoms (≥1 of agitation, apathy, catatonia, disorganized thinking, and paranoia) were prominent in 6/11 with encephalopathic symptoms. Eight of 10 with data available (from 23 total) improved after immunotherapy, a further 2 spontaneously. Staining of plasma membranes of live hippocampal neurons produced by patient IgGs (subclasses 1 and 2) colocalized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Decreased spiking and bursting behavior in mixed cultures of murine glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical neurons produced by patient IgGs were attributable to neither antigenic crosslinking and internalization nor complement activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs are predictive of distinct treatment-responsive autoimmune CNS disorders. Live neuron binding and induced electrophysiologic effects by patient IgGs may support septin-specific pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Optimum differentiation of FTLD from AD achieved with cross‐sectional tau PET</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess cross-sectional and longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]-flortaucipir PET uptake in pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to compare FTLD to cases with high and low levels of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). <b>Methods</b>: One-hundred forty-three participants who had completed at least one flortaucipir PET and autopsy-confirmed FTLD (n=52) or high (n=58) or low-ADNC (n=33) based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0-IV versus V-VI, were included. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for nine regions of interest (ROIs): an FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain, globus pallidum, an AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal, inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, precentral, and medial parietal. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare mean baseline SUVRs and annual rate of change in SUVR, by group. Sensitivity/specificity to distinguish FTLD from high and low-ADNC was calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline uptake in the FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain and globus pallidus were greater in FTLD than high and low-ADNC. No region showed a greater rate of flortaucipir accumulation in FTLD. Baseline uptake in the AD related regions, orbitofrontal and precentral cortices were greater in high-ADNC, and all showed greater rates of accumulation compared to FTLD. Baseline differences were superior to longitudinal rates in differentiating FTLD from high and low-ADNC. A simple baseline metric of midbrain/inferior temporal ratio of flortaucipir uptake provided good-excellent differentiation between FTLD and high and low-ADNC (sensitivities/specificities = 94%/95% and 71%/70%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in flortaucipir uptake between FTLD and high and low-ADNC. However, optimum differentiation between FTLD and ADNC was achieved with baseline uptake, rather than longitudinal rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature via central projections of primary afferent sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                TRPV1, a capsaicin- and heat-activated ion channel, is expressed by peripheral nociceptors and has been implicated in various inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, many TRPV1 agonists and antagonists produce thermomodulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials, limiting their utility. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and release proinflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, most notably the potent vasodilative neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, these body temperature effects may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs in vivo. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermomodulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanistically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Feedback between a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and the let-7 microRNAs controls the pace and number of molting cycles in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Animal development requires coordination among cyclic processes, sequential cell fate specifications, and once-a-lifetime morphogenic events, but the underlying timing mechanisms are not well understood. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> undergoes four molts at regular 8 to 10 hour intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD/<i>lin-42</i> and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the <i>let-7</i> family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian <span class="underline">r</span>etinoid-related <span class="underline">o</span>rphan <span class="underline">r</span>eceptors (RORs), and the <i>let-7</i> family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in <i>nhr-23</i> knockdowns and accelerated in <i>let-7(−)</i> mutants, but timed similarly in <i>let-7(−) nhr-23(−)</i> double mutants and wild-type animals. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the <i>let-7</i> promoter and activates transcription. In turn, <i>let-</i>7 dampens <i>nhr-23</i> expression across development via a complementary <i>let-7</i>-binding site (LCS) in the <i>nhr-23</i> 3′ UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and <i>let-7</i> hold true for other <i>let-7</i> family microRNAs. Either derepression of <i>nhr-23</i> transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of <i>nhr-23</i> leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and <i>let-7</i> also coregulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including <i>lin-42</i>. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian <i>ROR</i> and <i>let-7</i> genes function in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network, possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Understanding implicit sensorimotor adaptation as a process of proprioceptive re-alignment</a></h4>

              
                Multiple learning processes contribute to successful goal-directed actions in the face of changing physiological states, biomechanical constraints, and environmental contexts. Amongst these processes, implicit sensorimotor adaptation is of primary importance, ensuring that movements remain well-calibrated and accurate. A large body of work on reaching movements has emphasized how adaptation centers on an iterative process designed to minimize visual errors. The role of proprioception has been largely neglected, thought to play a passive role in which proprioception is affected by the visual error but does not directly contribute to adaptation. Here, we present an alternative to this visuo-centric framework, outlining a model in which implicit adaptation acts to minimize a proprioceptive error, the distance between the perceived hand position and its intended goal. This proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo) is consistent with many phenomena that have previously been interpreted in terms of learning from visual errors, and offers a parsimonious account of numerous unexplained phenomena. Cognizant that the evidence for PReMo rests on correlational studies, we highlight core predictions to be tested in future experiments, as well as note potential challenges for a proprioceptive-based perspective on implicit adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tissue-specific modifier alleles determine Mertk loss-of-function traits</a></h4>

              
                Knockout (KO) mouse models play critical roles in elucidating biological processes behind disease-associated or disease-resistant traits. As a presumed consequence of gene KO, mice display certain phenotypes. Based on insight into the molecular role of said gene in a biological process, it is inferred that the particular biological process causally underlies the trait. This approach has been crucial towards understanding the basis of pathological and/or advantageous traits associated with <i>Mertk</i> KO mice. <i>Mertk</i> KO mice suffer from severe, early-onset retinal degeneration. MERTK, expressed in retinal pigment epithelia, is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a critical role in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or cellular debris. Therefore, early-onset, severe retinal degeneration was described to be a direct consequence of failed MERTK-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelia. Here we report that the loss of <i>Mertk</i> alone is not sufficient for retinal degeneration. The widely used <i>Mertk</i> KO mouse carries multiple coincidental changes in its genome that affect the expression of a number of genes, including the <i>Mertk</i> paralog <i>Tyro3</i>. Retinal degeneration manifests only when the function of <i>Tyro3</i> is concomitantly lost. Furthermore, <i>Mertk</i> KO mice display improved anti-tumor immunity. MERTK is expressed in macrophages. Therefore, enhanced anti-tumor immunity was inferred to result from the failure of macrophages to dispose of cancer cell corpses, resulting in a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The resistance against two syngeneic mouse tumor models observed in <i>Mertk</i> KO mice is not, however, phenocopied by the loss of <i>Mertk </i>alone. Neither <i>Tyro3</i>, nor macrophage phagocytosis by alternate genetic redundancy, account for the absence of anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, our results indicate that context-dependent epistasis of independent modifier alleles determines <i>Mertk</i> KO traits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional heterogeneity and cell cycle regulation as central determinants of primitive endoderm priming</a></h4>

              
                During embryonic development cells acquire identity at the same time as they are proliferating, implying that an intrinsic facet of cell fate choice requires coupling lineage decisions to rates of cell division. How is the cell cycle regulated to promote or suppress heterogeneity and differentiation? We explore this question combining time lapse imaging with single cell RNA-seq in the contexts of self-renewal, priming and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards the Primitive Endoderm lineage (PrE). Since ESCs are derived from the Inner Cell Mass of the mammalian blastocyst, ESCs in standard culture conditions are transcriptionally heterogeneous containing subfractions that are primed for either of the two ICM lineages, Epiblast and PrE. These subfractions represent dynamic states that can readily interconvert in culture, and the PrE subfraction is functionally primed for endoderm differentiation. Here we find that differential regulation of cell cycle can tip the balance between these primed populations, such that naïve ESC culture conditions promote Epiblast-like expansion and PrE differentiation stimulates the selective survival and proliferation of PrE-primed cells. In endoderm differentiation, we find that this change is accompanied by a counter-intuitive increase in G1 length that also appears replicated <i>in vivo</i>. While FGF/ERK signalling is a known key regulator of ESCs and PrE differentiation, we find it is not just responsible for ESCs heterogeneity, but also cell cycle synchronisation, required for the inheritance of similar cell cycles between sisters and cousins. Taken together, our results point to a tight relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and cell cycle regulation in the context of lineage priming, with primed cell populations providing a pool of flexible cell types that can be expanded in a lineage-specific fashion while allowing plasticity during early determination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PLK4 drives centriole amplification and apical surface area expansion in multiciliated cells</a></h4>

              
                Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are terminally differentiated epithelia that assemble multiple motile cilia used to promote fluid flow. To template these cilia, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is essential for centriole duplication; however recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, we created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structures of topoisomerase V in complex with DNA reveal unusual DNA binding mode and novel relaxation mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Topoisomerase V is a unique topoisomerase that combines DNA repair and topoisomerase activities. The enzyme has an unusual arrangement, with a small topoisomerase domain followed by 12 tandem (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains, which include three AP lyase repair domains. The uncommon architecture of this enzyme bears no resemblance to any other known topoisomerase. Here we present structures of topoisomerase V in complex with DNA. The structures show that the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains wrap around the DNA and in this manner appear to act as a processivity factor. There is a conformational change in the protein to expose the topoisomerase active site. The DNA bends sharply to enter the active site, which melts the DNA and probably facilitates relaxation. The structures show a DNA binding mode not observed before and provide information on the way this atypical topoisomerase relaxes DNA. In common with type IB enzymes, topoisomerase V relaxes DNA using a controlled rotation mechanism, but the structures show that topoisomerase V accomplishes this in different manner. Overall, the structures firmly establish that type IC topoisomerases form a distinct type of topoisomerases, with no similarities to other types at the sequence, structural, or mechanistic level. They represent a completely different solution to DNA relaxation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PH domain-mediated autoinhibition and oncogenic activation of Akt</a></h4>

              
                Akt is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that plays a central role in metabolism and cancer. Regulation of Akt's activity involves an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and its kinase domain that can be relieved by C-tail phosphorylation. PH domain mutant E17K Akt is a well-established oncogene. Previously, we reported that the conformation of autoinhibited Akt may be shifted by small molecule allosteric inhibitors limiting the mechanistic insights from existing X-ray structures that have relied on such compounds (Chu, Viennet, et al, 2020). Here we discover unexpectedly that a single mutation R86A Akt exhibits intensified autoinhibitory features with enhanced PH domain-kinase domain affinity. Structural and biochemical analysis uncovers the importance of a key interaction network involving Arg86, Glu17, and Tyr18 that controls Akt conformation and activity. Our studies also shed light on the molecular basis for E17K Akt activation as an oncogenic driver.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Local field potentials reflect cortical population dynamics in a region-specific and frequency-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The spiking activity of populations of cortical neurons is well described by the dynamics of a small number of population-wide covariance patterns, the 'latent dynamics'. These latent dynamics are largely driven by the same correlated synaptic currents across the circuit that determine the generation of local field potentials (LFP). Yet, the relationship between latent dynamics and LFPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterised this relationship for three different regions of primate sensorimotor cortex during reaching. The correlation between latent dynamics and LFPs was frequency-dependent and varied across regions. However, for any given region, this relationship remained stable throughout the behaviour: in each of primary motor and premotor cortices, the LFP-latent dynamics correlation profile was remarkably similar between movement planning and execution. These robust associations between LFPs and neural population latent dynamics help bridge the wealth of studies reporting neural correlates of behaviour using either type of recordings.

In these models, granule cells form a sparse, combinatorial encoding of diverse sensorimotor inputs. Such sparse representations are optimal for learning to discriminate random stimuli. However, recent observations of dense, low-dimensional activity across granule cells have called into question the role of sparse coding in these neurons. Here, we generalize theories of cerebellar learning to determine the optimal granule cell representation for tasks beyond random stimulus discrimination, including continuous input-output transformations as required for smooth motor control. We show that for such tasks, the optimal granule cell representation is substantially denser than predicted by classic theories. Our results provide a general theory of learning in cerebellum-like systems and suggest that optimal cerebellar representations are task-dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Dynorphin/Kappa Opioid Receptor mediates adverse immunological and behavioral outcomes induced by repetitive blast trauma in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adverse pathophysiological and behavioral outcomes related to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain are common following blast exposure and contribute to decreased quality of life, but underlying mechanisms and prophylactic/treatment options remain limited. The dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system helps regulate behavioral and inflammatory responses to stress and injury; however, it has yet to be investigated as a potential mechanism in either humans or animals exposed to blast. We hypothesized that blast-induced KOR activation mediates adverse outcomes related to inflammation and affective behavioral response. Methods: C57Bl/6 adult male mice were singly or repeatedly exposed to either sham (anesthesia only) or blast delivered by a pneumatic shock tube. The selective KOR antagonist norBNI or vehicle (saline) was administered 72 hours prior to repetitive blast or sham exposure. Serum and brain were collected 10 minutes or 4 hours post-exposure for dynorphin and cytokine measurements, respectively. At one-month post-exposure, mice were tested in a series of behavioral assays related to adverse outcomes reported by humans with blast trauma. Results: Repetitive but not single blast exposure resulted in increased brain dynorphin level. norBNI pretreatment blocked or significantly reduced blast-induced increase in serum and brain cytokines, including IL-6, at 4 hours post exposure and aversive/anxiety-like behavioral dysfunction at one month post exposure. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a previously unreported role for the dynorphin/KOR system as a mediator of biochemical and behavioral dysfunction following repetitive blast exposure and highlight this system as a potential prophylactic/therapeutic treatment target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">D-cycloserine, a mixed NMDAR agonist/antagonist is Not Susceptible to Self-administration, unlike S-ketamine Using an Intravenous Self-administration Model in Naive and Ketamine-habituated Sprague-Dawley Rats</a></h4>

              
                OBJECTIVE: N-methyl D-aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) antagonist antidepressants have known potential for abuse liability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abuse liability of D-cycloserine (DCS), using a self-administration paradigm in which DCS was tested for its efficacy in substituting for ketamine in ketamine-dependent rats. METHODS: A standard Intravenous self-administration study was conducted in Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats to study the compounds' abuse liability. The potential for self-administration was assessed in ketamine-habituated subjects. Subjects were trained to press a lever to obtain food, prior to connection of the lever to the intravenous drug administration apparatus. DCS was provided for self-infusion by test subjects at doses of 1.5, 5.0, and 15mg/kg per lever press. RESULTS: S-Ketamine was seen to substitute for ketamine and to result in self-administration at the same frequency. DCS was not seen to result in self-administration at any of the test doses. The self-infusion behavior of DCS was the same as that of saline. CONCLUSION: D-cycloserine, a mixed agonist/antagonist of the NMDAR glycine site, which has been shown to have antidepressant and anti-suicidal properties in clinical studies has no apparent potential for abuse liability in a standard rodent self-administration model.

                The experience of the self as an embodied agent in the world is an essential aspect of human consciousness. This experience arises from the feeling of control over one's bodily actions, termed the Sense of Agency (SoA), and the feeling that the body belongs to the self, Body Ownership (BO). Despite long-standing philosophical and scientific interest in the relationship between the body and brain, the neural systems involved in SoA and BO and especially their interactions, are not yet understood. In this preregistered study using the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion inside an MR-scanner, we aimed to uncover the relationship between BO & SoA in the human brain. Importantly, by using both visuomotor and visuotactile stimulations and measuring online trial-by-trial fluctuations in the illusion magnitude, we were able to disentangle brain systems related to objective sensory stimulation and subjective judgments of the bodily-self. Our results indicate that at both the behavioral and neural levels, BO and SoA are strongly interrelated. Multisensory regions in the occipital and fronto-parietal regions encoded convergence of sensory stimulation conditions. However, the subjective judgments of bodily-self were also related to BOLD fluctuations in regions not activated by the sensory conditions such as the insular cortex and precuneus. Our results highlight the convergence of multisensory processing in specific neural systems for both BO and SoA with partially dissociable regions for subjective judgments in regions of the default mode network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-independent scaling of neural responses to task difficulty in the multiple-demand network</a></h4>

              
                The multiple-demand (MD) network is sensitive to many aspects of cognitive demand, showing increased activation with more difficult tasks. However, it is currently unknown whether the MD network is modulated by the context in which task difficulty is experienced. Using fMRI, we examined MD network responses to low, medium, and high difficulty arithmetic problems within two cued contexts, an easy versus a hard set. The results showed that MD activity varied reliably with the absolute difficulty of a problem, independent of the context in which the problem was presented. Similarly, MD activity during task execution was independent of the difficulty of the previous trial. Representational similarity analysis further supported that representational distances in the MD network were consistent with a context-independent code. Finally, we identified several regions outside the MD network that showed context-dependent coding, including the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, precentral gryus, and large areas of visual cortex. In sum, cognitive effort is processed by the MD network in a context-independent manner. We suggest that this absolute coding of cognitive demand in the MD network reflects the limited range of task difficulty that can be supported by the cognitive apparatus.

                Ciliopathies are characterized by the absence or dysfunction of primary cilia. Despite the fact that cognitive impairments are a common feature of ciliopathies, how cilia dysfunction affects neuronal development has not been characterized in detail. Here, we show that the primary cilium is required cell-autonomously by neurons during neural circuit formation. In particular, the primary cilium is crucial during axonal pathfinding for the switch in responsiveness of axons at a choice point, or intermediate target. Utilizing animal models and in vivo, ex vivo, as well as in vitro experiments, we provide evidence for a critical role of the primary cilium in long-range axon guidance. The primary cilium on the cell body of commissural neurons transduces long-range guidance signals sensed by growth cones navigating an intermediate target. In extension of our finding that Shh is required for the rostral turn of post-crossing commissural axons, we show here that the cilium is required for a transcriptional change of axon guidance receptors, which in turn mediate the repulsive response to floorplate-derived Shh shown by post-crossing commissural axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible multitask computation in recurrent networks utilizes shared dynamical motifs</a></h4>

              
                Flexible computation is a hallmark of intelligent behavior. Yet, little is known about how neural networks contextually reconfigure for different computations. Humans are able to perform a new task without extensive training, presumably through the composition of elementary processes that were previously learned. Cognitive scientists have long hypothesized the possibility of a compositional neural code, where complex neural computations are made up of constituent components; however, the neural substrate underlying this structure remains elusive in biological and artificial neural networks. Here we identified an algorithmic neural substrate for compositional computation through the study of multitasking artificial recurrent neural networks. Dynamical systems analyses of networks revealed learned computational strategies that mirrored the modular subtask structure of the task-set used for training. Dynamical motifs such as attractors, decision boundaries and rotations were reused across different task computations. For example, tasks that required memory of a continuous circular variable repurposed the same ring attractor. We show that dynamical motifs are implemented by clusters of units and are reused across different contexts, allowing for flexibility and generalization of previously learned computation. Lesioning these clusters resulted in modular effects on network performance: a lesion that destroyed one dynamical motif only minimally perturbed the structure of other dynamical motifs. Finally, modular dynamical motifs could be reconfigured for fast transfer learning. After slow initial learning of dynamical motifs, a subsequent faster stage of learning reconfigured motifs to perform novel tasks. This work contributes to a more fundamental understanding of compositional computation underlying flexible general intelligence in neural systems. We present a conceptual framework that establishes dynamical motifs as a fundamental unit of computation, intermediate between the neuron and the network. As more whole brain imaging studies record neural activity from multiple specialized systems simultaneously, the framework of dynamical motifs will guide questions about specialization and generalization across brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of calcium, Akt and ERK signaling in cadmium-induced hair cell death</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to heavy metals, an environmental toxin, has been shown to cause damage to a variety of different tissues and cell types including hair cells, the sensory cells of our inner ears responsible for hearing and balance. Elevated levels of one such metal, cadmium, has been associated with hearing loss and shown to cause hair cell death in multiple experimental models. While the mechanisms of cadmium-induced cell death have been extensively studied in other cell types they remain relatively unknown in hair cells. We have found that calcium signaling, known to be an important regulator of cadmium toxicity in other cell types, does not appear to play a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death. While calmodulin inhibition can partially protect hair cells this may be due to impacts on mechanotransduction activity, and inhibiting CaMKII, the IP3 receptor and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter all failed to protect against cadmium-induced hair cell death. We also found cadmium treatment increased pAkt levels in hair cells and pERK levels in supporting cells. This activation appears to be protective in nature as inhibiting these pathways enhanced cadmium-induced hair cell death rather than protecting cells. Thus cadmium-induced hair cell death appears distinct from cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types where calcium, Akt and ERK signaling pathways all promote cell death.

                Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation is essential for action potential generation in the brain. Allosteric calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist, cinacalcet, strongly and ubiquitously inhibits VGSC currents in neocortical neurons via an unidentified, G-protein-dependent blocking molecule. The mechanisms by which VGSC characteristics influence cinacalcet-mediated inhibition are not well understood. Here, using whole-cell patch clamp methods, we investigated the voltage-dependence of cinacalcet-mediated inhibition of VGSCs and the channel state preference of cinacalcet. The rate of inhibition of VGSC currents was accelerated at more depolarized holding potentials. Cinacalcet shifted the voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation of VGSCs in the hyperpolarizing direction. Utilizing a simple model, the voltage-dependence of VGSC current inhibition may be explained if the affinity of the blocking molecule to the channel states follows the sequence: fast inactivated > slow inactivated > resting. The state dependence of block contributes to the non-linearity of action potential block by cinacalcet. This dynamic and abundant signaling pathway by which G-proteins regulate VGSC currents provides an important voltage-dependent mechanism for modulating central neuronal excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cognitive and neural correlates of irony</a></h4>

              
                One of the most difficult forms of communication is irony (Wilson & Sperber, 1981), therefore it has been proposed that it can be a useful indicator of communication abilities (Caillies et al., 2014). Irony is a statement that transmits the opposite meaning of its literal counterpart (Grice, 1975). The cognitive process of mentalization, executive functions and holistic processing style may participate in irony detection. The brain areas that have been associated with detection of irony are the medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the posterior superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, the inferior parietal lobule, among others. The aim of this study was to analyze the cognitive processes involved in irony identification and its neural correlates in a sample of Mexican adults. A total of 45 participants performed an irony identification task during MRI acquisition, while cognitive processes were assessed with a psychometric battery. From the statements evaluated (i.e. ironic, literal, unrelated and white lies), irony was the hardest intention to detect, having the lowest percentage of correct classification and the slowest classification time. The cognitive process that correlated with irony detection were the tasks that evaluated ToM, inhibitory control and verbal abilities. The identification of ironic statements recruited brain areas associated with ToM, language, and inhibitory control networks.

                Reward-seeking requires the coordination of motor programs to achieve goals. Midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for reinforcement and their activation is sufficient for learning about cues, actions, and outcomes. Here we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying the ability of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) dopamine neurons to support instrumental learning. By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes. VTA dopamine neurons imbue actions and their associated cues with motivational value that allows flexible and persistent pursuit whereas SNc dopamine neurons support time-limited, precise, action-specific learning that is non-scalable and inflexible. This architecture is reminiscent of actor-critic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous dopamine systems support unique forms of instrumental learning that ultimately result in disparate reward-seeking strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhancement of vestibular motion discrimination by small stochastic whole-body perturbations in young healthy humans</a></h4>

              
                Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation has been shown to improve vestibular perception in healthy subjects. Here, we sought to obtain similar results using more natural stimuli consisting of small-amplitude motion perturbations of the whole body. Thirty participants were asked to report the perceived direction of antero-posterior sinusoidal motion on a MOOG platform. We compared the baseline perceptual thresholds with those obtained by applying small, stochastic perturbations at different power levels along the antero-posterior axis, symmetrically distributed around a zero-mean. At the population level, we found that the thresholds for all but the highest level of noise were significantly lower than the baseline threshold. At the individual level, the threshold was lower with at least one noise level than the threshold without noise in 87% of participants. Thus, small, stochastic oscillations of the whole body can increase the probability of detecting subthreshold vestibular signals, possibly due to stochastic resonance mechanisms. We suggest that, just as the external noise of the present experiments, also the spontaneous random oscillations of the body associated with standing posture are beneficial by enhancing vestibular thresholds with a mechanism similar to stochastic resonance. The results are also relevant from a clinical perspective, since they raise the possibility of improving motion perception in people with elevated thresholds due to aging or vestibulopathy by means of small-amplitude motion perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic Activity Develops Along a Sensorimotor-Association Cortical Axis in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Animal studies of neurodevelopmental plasticity have shown that intrinsic brain activity evolves from high amplitude and globally synchronized to suppressed and sparse as plasticity declines and the cortex matures. Leveraging resting-state functional MRI data from 1033 individuals (8-23 years), we reveal that this stereotyped refinement of intrinsic activity occurs during human development and provides evidence for a cortical gradient of neurodevelopmental plasticity during childhood and adolescence. Specifically, we demonstrate that declines in the amplitude of intrinsic activity are initiated heterochronously across regions, coupled to the maturation of a plasticity-restricting structural feature, and temporally staggered along a hierarchical sensorimotor-association axis from ages 8 to 18. Youth from disadvantaged environments exhibit reduced intrinsic activity in regions further up the sensorimotor-association axis, suggestive of a reduced level of plasticity in late-maturing cortices. Our results uncover a hierarchical axis of neurodevelopment and offer insight into the temporal sequence of protracted neurodevelopmental plasticity in humans.

                Background: Emerging evidence supports the view that brain stimulation might improve essential tremor (ET) by altering brain dynamics and facilitating brain plasticity. Yet, we are still missing a mechanistic explanation of the whole brain dynamics underlying these plasticity-defining changes. Method: In this study, we explored the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) on dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in patients with ET. Resting-state fMRI (RsfMRI) was acquired before and after a single session of rTMS in 30 patients with ET and compared with RsfMRI of 20 age, gender and education matched healthy controls (HCs). We have measured the effect of brain stimulation using network topological re-organization through whole brain integration and segregation, brain stability and capacity of neural propagation through metastability and intrinsic ignition. Results: Patients with ET had altered DFC measures compared to controls. After a single session rTMS, the connectivity measures approached normality and patients with ET revealed significantly higher integration, lower segregation with higher metastability and increased intrinsic ignition. Conclusion: Brain metastability and intrinsic ignition measures could be valuable tools in appreciating mechanisms of brain stimulation in ET and other neurological diseases.

                Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) are enigmatic mechano- or chemosensory cells lying along the central canal of the spinal cord. Recent studies in zebrafish larvae and lampreys have shown that CSF-cNs control postures and movements via spinal connections. However, the structures, connectivity, and functions in mammals remain largely unknown. Here we developed a method to genetically target mouse CSF-cNs that highlighted structural connections and functions. We first found that intracerebroventricular injection of adeno-associated virus with a neuron-specific promoter and Pkd2l1-Cre mice specifically labeled CSF-cNs. Single-cell labeling of 71 CSF-cNs revealed rostral axon extensions of over 1800 um in unmyelinated bundles in the ventral funiculus and terminated on CSF-cNs to form a recurrent circuitry, which was further determined by serial electron microscopy and electrophysiology. CSF-cNs were also found to connect with axial motor neurons and premotor interneurons around the central canal and within the axon bundles. Chemogenetic CSF-cNs inactivation reduced speed and step frequency during treadmill locomotion. Our data revealed the basic structures and connections of mouse CSF-cNs to control spinal motor circuits for proper locomotion. The versatile methods developed in this study will contribute to further understanding of CSF-cNs functions in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of retinogeniculate synaptic function in the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons comprise the optic nerve and carry information to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) that is relayed to the cortex for conscious vision. Glaucoma is a blinding neurodegenerative disease that commonly results from intraocular pressure (IOP)-associated injury leading to RGC axonal pathology, disruption of RGC outputs to the brain, and eventual apoptotic loss of RGC somata. The consequences of elevated IOP and glaucomatous pathology on RGC signaling to the dLGN are largely unknown and likely to be important contributors to visual system dysfunction in glaucoma. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine how glaucoma affects RGC outputs to the dLGN. Methods: We used a combination of anatomical and physiological approaches to study the structure and function of retinogeniculate synapses in male and female DBA/2J mice at multiple ages before and after IOP elevation. These included measures of anterograde axonal transport, immunofluorescence staining of RGC axon terminals, patch-clamp recording retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in living brain slices, Sholl analysis of thalamocortical relay neuron dendrites, measurements of RGC somatic density, and treatment with a topical ophthalmic alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (brimonidine). Results: DBA/2J mice showed progressive loss of anterograde optic tract transport to the dLGN and vGlut2 labeling of RGC axon terminals. Patch-clamp measurements of RG synaptic function showed that the strength of synaptic transmission was lower in 9 and 12-month DBA/2J mice and that this was the result of loss of individual RGC axon contributions. TC neuron dendrites showed a reduction in complexity at 12 months, suggestive of a delayed reorganization following reduced synaptic input. There was no detectable change in RGC soma density in 11-12m DBA/2J retinas indicating that observed effects occurred prior to RGC somatic loss. Finally, treatment with brimonidine eye drops prevented the loss of vGlut2-labeled RGC terminals in the dLGN. Conclusions: These findings identify glaucoma- and IOP-associated functional deficits in an important subcortical RGC projection target. This sheds light on the processes linking IOP to vision loss and will be critical for informing future diagnostic approaches and vision-restoration therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical unimodal processing within the primary somatosensory cortex during a bimodal detection task</a></h4>

              
                Where and how in the brain do neurons process more than one sensory modality? To answer these questions, scientists have generated a wide variety of studies at distinct space-time scales in different animal models, and often shown contradictory conclusions. Some conclude that this process occurs in early sensory cortices, but others that this occurs in areas central to sensory cortices. Here, we sought to determine whether sensory neurons process and encode physical stimulus properties of different modalities (tactile and acoustic). For this, we designed a bimodal detection task where the senses of touch and hearing compete from trial to trial. Two Rhesus monkeys performed this novel task, while neural activity was recorded in areas 3b and 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We analyzed neurons' coding properties and variability, organizing them by their receptive field's position relative to the stimulation zone. Our results indicate that neurons of areas 3b and 1 are unimodal, encoding only the tactile modality, both in the firing rate and variability, but not to the acoustic one. Moreover, we found that neurons of both subareas encode the tactile information differently, revealing a hidden processing-based hierarchy. Finally, using a powerful non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, we show that the activity from areas 3b and 1 can be separated, establishing a clear division in the functionality of these two subareas of S1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of PainFace, a software platform that simplifies and standardizes mouse grimace analyses</a></h4>

              
                Facial grimaces are now commonly used to quantify spontaneous pain in mice and other mammalian species, but scoring remains subjective and relies on humans with very different levels of proficiency. Here, we developed a Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) for black-coated (C57BL/6) mice consisting of four facial action units (orbitals, nose, ears, whiskers). We used this scale to generate ground truth data from over 70,000 images of black mice in different settings. With this large data set, we developed a deep neural network and cloud-based software platform called PainFace (http://painface.net) that accurately scores facial grimaces of black mice on a 0-8 scale. PainFace generates over two orders of magnitude more MGS data than humans can realistically achieve, and at superhuman speed. By analyzing the frequency distribution of grimace scores, we found that mice spent >7x more time in a high grimace state following laparotomy surgery relative to sham surgery controls. The analgesic carprofen reduced the amount of time animals spent in this high grimace state after surgery. Specific facial action unit score combinations were overrepresented following laparotomy surgery, suggesting that characteristic facial expressions are associated with a high grimace state. We performed validation experiments in two labs located in different countries to demonstrate reproducibility of the PainFace platform. To further enhance rigor and reproducibility, we will invite pain researchers to beta test PainFace and then incorporate their feedback into the software and manuscript prior to peer review. While this study is focused on mice, PainFace was designed to simplify, standardize, and scale up grimace analyses with many other mammalian species, including humans.

                Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Studies suggest dysfunctional signaling of the neuropeptide oxytocin as one of the key mechanisms in PWS, and administration of oxytocin via intranasal or systemic routes yielded promising results in both humans and mouse models. However, a detailed assessment of the oxytocin system in mouse models of PWS such as the Magel2-deficient Magel2tm1.Stw mouse, is lacking. In this study, we performed an automated counting of oxytocin cells in the entire paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of Magel2tm1.Stw and wild-type control mice and found a significant reduction in the caudal part, which represents the parvocellular subdivision. In addition, based on the recent discovery that some astrocytes express the oxytocin receptor (OTR), we performed detailed analysis of astrocyte numbers and morphology in various brain regions, and assessed expression levels of the astrocyte marker GFAP, which was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus, but not other brain regions in Magel2tm1.Stw mice. Finally, we analyzed the number of OTR-expressing astrocytes in various brain regions and found a significant reduction in the nucleus accumbens of Magel2tm1.Stw mice, as well as a sex-specific difference in the lateral septum. This study suggests a role for caudal PVN OT neurons as well as OTR-expressing astrocytes in a mouse model of PWS, provides novel information about sex-specific expression of astrocytic OTRs, and presents several new brain regions containing OTR-expressing astrocytes in the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Cellular Positioning System to Probe Morphological Heterogeneity Among Mouse CA3 Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus are not homogeneous in their structure or function, yet the structure and function of individual neurons are well-correlated. Despite these well-known facts, few structural studies of pyramidal neuronal dendrites in the hippocampus have controlled for precise cellular position within the hippocampus along its dorsoventral (longitudinal), tangential (proximodistal), or radial axes. We believe this is largely due to technical limitations that limit positional information about the neuron, limit throughput, and limit the control of confounding variables. New method: Here, we present a simple approach to address these limitations effectively in mouse CA3, adapted from our prior work in the mouse cerebral cortex. Our approach tracks the dorsoventral, tangential, and radial positions of neurons within the hippocampus, increases the number of available neurons for analysis, and provides several new controls. Results: We demonstrate how topographic and morphological data are related to one another among mouse CA3 pyramidal neurons, in a pilot data set providing proof-of-concept. Comparison with existing methods: Other common methods of labeling neurons, such as biocytin fills or Golgi-Cox stains, are labor- or time-intensive. Here, we validate the use of the transgenic fluorescent Thy1-GFP-M line, so the labeling step is practically eliminated. Other methods section the hippocampus coronally, which distorts the dorsoventral, tangential, and radial axes. Here, we preserve all three axes. Some existing methods do not collect all sections in order, instead focusing on "more dorsal" or "more ventral" sections, for example. We preserve much more dorsoventral information. Recent work has shown that CA2 is better defined by immunohistochemical rather than neuroanatomical markers. We use that immunohistochemistry here to increase precision in defining tangential position. Other studies have not measured other, critical variables and relationships that could confound the results. Here, we assess many more of these variables and relationships to increase the rigor of our work. Conclusions: We developed a more rigorous method for preserving precise cellular positioning information among reconstructed mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Although we provide several innovations in our method, each innovation identified here could independently improve the rigor and reproducibility of a wide variety of approaches for understanding the morphological heterogeneity of pyramidal neurons in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Connectivity on Narrative Temporal Processing in Structured Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of language are having an increasing impact in understanding the neural bases of language processing in humans. A recent model of cortical dynamics based on reservoir computing was able to account for temporal aspects of human narrative processing as revealed by fMRI. In this context the current research introduces a form of structured reservoir computing, where network dynamics are further constrained by the connectivity architecture in order to begin to explain large scale hierarchical network properties of human cortical activity during narrative comprehension. Cortical processing takes place at different time scales depending on the position in a hierarchy from posterior sensory input areas to higher level associative frontal cortical areas. This phenomena is likely related to the cortical connectivity architecture. Recent studies have identified heterogeneity in this posterior-anterior hierarchy, with certain frontal associative areas displaying a faster narrative integration response than much more posterior areas. We hypothesize that these discontinuities can be due to white matter connectivity that would create shortcuts from fast sensory areas to distant frontal areas. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the white matter connectivity of these areas and discovered clear connectivity patterns in accord with our hypotheses. Based on these observations we performed simulations using reservoir networks with connectivity patterns structured with an exponential distance rule, yielding the sensory-associative hierarchy. We then introduce connectivity short-cuts corresponding to those observed in human anatomy, resulting in frontal areas with unusually fast narrative processing. Using structured reservoir computing we confirmed the hypothesis that topographic position in a cortical hierarchy can be dominated by long distance connections that can bring frontal areas closer to the sensory periphery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Minimum effort simulations of split-belt treadmill walking exploit asymmetry to reduce metabolic energy expenditure</a></h4>

              
                Walking on a split-belt treadmill elicits an adaptation response that changes the baseline step length asymmetry of the walker. The underlying causes of this adaptation, however, are difficult to determine. It has been proposed that effort minimization may drive this adaptation, based on the idea that adopting longer steps on the fast belt, or positive step length asymmetry (SLA), can cause the treadmill to exert net-positive mechanical work on a bipedal walker. However, humans walking on split-belt treadmills have not been observed to reproduce this behavior when allowed to freely adapt. To determine if an energy minimization motor control strategy would result in experimentally observed adaptation patterns, we conducted simulations of walking on different combinations of belt speeds with a human musculoskeletal model which minimized muscle effort. The model adopted increasing amounts of positive step length asymmetry and decreased its net metabolic rate with increasing belt speed asymmetry, up to +25.6% SLA and -14.3% metabolic rate at a 3:1 belt speed ratio, relative to tied-belt walking. These gains were primarily enabled by an increase of braking work and a reduction of propulsion work on the fast belt. The results suggest that a purely energy minimization driven split belt walking strategy would involve substantial positive SLA, and that the lack of this characteristic in human behavior points to additional factors influencing the motor control strategy, such as aversion to excessive joint loads, asymmetry, or instability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel Framework for In-vivo Diffusion Tensor Distribution MRI of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neural tissue microstructure plays an important role in developmental, physiological and pathophysiological processes. Diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) MRI helps probe heterogeneity at the mesoscopic length scale, orders of magnitude smaller than the nominal MRI voxel size, by describing water diffusion within a voxel using an ensemble of non-exchanging compartments characterized by a probability density function of diffusion tensors. In this study, we provide a new framework for acquiring tensor encoded diffusion weighted images (DWIs) and estimating DTD from them for in-vivo human brain imaging. We interfused pulsed field gradients (iPFG) in a single spin echo to generate arbitrary b-tensors of rank one, two, or three without introducing concomitant gradient artifacts. Employing well-defined gradient pulse duration and mixing/diffusion times in our diffusion preparation, we show that iPFG retains salient features of traditional multiple-PFG (mPFG) sequence while overcoming some of its implementation issues thereby extending its applications beyond DTD MRI. We assume DTD is a maximum entropy tensor-variate normal distribution whose tensor random variables are constrained to be positive definite (CNTVD) to ensure their physicality. In each voxel, the second-order mean and fourth-order covariance tensors of the DTD are estimated using a Monte Carlo method that synthesizes micro-diffusion tensors with corresponding size, shape and orientation distributions to best fit the measured DWIs. From these tensors we obtain the mean diffusivity (MD) spectrum, spectrum of diffusion tensor shapes, microscopic orientation distribution function (ODF), and microscopic fractional anisotropy (FA) which disentangle the underlying heterogeneity within a voxel. Using DTD derived ODF, we introduce a new method to perform fiber tractography capable of resolving complex fiber configurations. The results obtained in the live human brain showed microscopic anisotropy in various gray and white matter regions and skewed MD distribution in cerebellar gray matter not observed previously. DTD MRI tractography captured complex white matter fiber organization consistent with known anatomy. DTD MRI also resolved some degeneracies associated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and identified the source of microscopic anisotropy which may help improve the diagnosis of various neurological diseases and disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional organization of mouse auditory cortex in response to stimulus complexity and brain state</a></h4>

              
                The functional organization of sensory cortices is modulated by both extrinsic events and intrinsic states. The present study aimed to assess the mouse auditory cortex (AC) responses under varying conditions of stimulus complexity and brain state. Using wide-field calcium imaging, our results suggest a complete outline of topographic maps of frequency and FM rate as well as highly responsive regions to mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in both awake and anesthetized states. Three new regions responsive to high-frequency tones and four new gradients responsive to frequency modulations (FMs) were identified. These maps are highly replicable across weeks and between animals. In awake versus anesthetized states, cortical responsiveness to pure tones was stronger, and regions that preferentially responded to slow rate FMs were smaller. In both states, fast FM regions showed the greatest contribution to the processing of USVs. Finally, our modeling of how best tone frequency or FM rate changes as a function of distance along a topographic gradient resulted in a sigmoid function. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of mouse AC functional organization and how this organization is modulated by changes in stimulus complexity and brain state. The function of newly identified regions in higher-order auditory/vocal processing and animal behavior should be considered in future research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing Deep Learning Models for Age Prediction Based on the Resting State fMRI Dataset from the "Brain Dock" Service in Japan</a></h4>

              
                In Japan, many hospitals provide the unequaled service of medical check-up called the "Brain Dock"; however, there is a paucity of studies aimed at leveraging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in hospitals. We obtained the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans of about 695 patients who accessed this service for preventive medicine against Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, we created deep learning models for age prediction with the ultimate aim of arriving at standard protocols for introducing rs-fMRI into clinical settings, particularly in Brain Docks. With that view, an assemblage of modeling conditions was attempted, changing multiple parameter values, features based on data extraction methods (region of interest-wise mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent lump-sum time series models or dynamic functional connectivity models), deep learning algorithms (Transformer, Multi-task Transformer, and unidirectional or bidirectional long short-term memory models), and different atlas-dependent brain region segmentation methods (including the Automated Anatomical Labeling and Harvard-Oxford atlases). As a result, a robust and highly significant correlation was obtained between actual and predicted ages from all types of methodologies. In addition, we determined that some conditions had a relatively large impact on prediction performance based on extended comparisons. The accuracy decreased, particularly according to the choice of atlases but with the same modeling conditions. Notwithstanding, we found that atlases based on intrinsic functional connectivity provided significant prediction accuracy even with a small number of regions to a similar extent as networks lowered spatial granularity. Moreover, we found that multi-task learning with other phenotype data (related to gender differences) was possible, but did not improve the prediction accuracy as much as expected. Despite these limitations, our results could provide a hopeful prospect of introducing fMRI into the field of neuro-clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Embryonic Retinal Waves</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous activity is a hallmark of developing neural systems. In the retina, spontaneous activity comes in the form of retinal waves, comprised of three stages persisting from embryonic day 16 (E16) to eye opening at postnatal day 14 (P14). Though postnatal retinal waves have been well characterized, little is known about the spatiotemporal properties or the mechanisms mediating embryonic retinal waves, designated Stage 1 waves. Using a custom-built macroscope to record spontaneous calcium transients from whole embryonic retinas, we show that Stage 1 waves are initiated at several locations across the retina and propagate across finite regions of a broad range of areas. A gap junction antagonist, meclofenamic acid, reduced the frequency and size of Stage 1 waves but did not abolish them. The general nAChR antagonist, hexamethonium blocked Stage 1 waves, while they persisted in the presence of 4{beta}2 nAChR antagonist dihydro{beta}-erythroidine, indicating that the spatiotemporal properties of Stage 1 waves are mediated by a complex circuitry involving subtypes of nAChRs and gap junctions. Stage 1 waves in mice lacking the {beta}2 subunit of the nAChRs ({beta}2-nAChR-KO) were reduced, but in contrast to WT mice, they persisted in the hexamethonium and were completely blocked by meclofenamic acid. To assay the impact of Stage 1 waves on retinal development, we compared the spatial distribution of a subtype of retinal ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in WT and {beta}2-nAChR-KO mice. We found that the developmental decrease of ipRGC density is preserved between WT and {beta}2-nAChR-KO mice, indicating that processes regulating ipRGC distribution are not influenced by spontaneous activity.

                Backgrounds: Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the strongest environmental risks for late-life dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the interaction between genetic factors and environmental exposure to mild TBI triggering neurodegenerative processes is still unclear. We used longitudinal imaging to differentiate spatial patterns of progressive brain volume loss in individual patients with and without carrying apolipoprotein E (APOE) {varepsilon}4 carriers. Methods: For 59 patients with acute mild TBI (mTBI, age: 36.92 {+/-} 11.91 years; 14 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers) and 48 matched healthy controls (HCs, age: 37.92 {+/-} 11.72 years; 10 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers), longitudinal (6-12 months follow-up) brain structure was assessed using voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted scans. Longitudinal volume changes in the temporal lobe were characterized by the Jacobian determinant (JD) metric, reflecting spatial warping between the baseline and follow-up scans. JD values were regionally calculated and correlated with neuropsychological measures. Results: MTBI patients lost a mean of 0.27% (SD = 0.43) of GM and 0.27% (SD = 0.50) of WM volume in the temporal lobe over the 6-12 month follow-up. Patients with a high genetic risk for AD (APOE {varepsilon}4 allele carries) were associated with severer atrophy in the left superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus regions than the controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, atrophy in these regions of gray matter could predict the performance change ratio of the language fluency in mTBI APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers ({beta} = 0.570, P < 0.05). While, compared with HC APOE {varepsilon}4 non-carriers, mTBI non-carriers exhibited volume loss in the medial temporal lobe. Conclusions: This prospective study provided evidence that the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele interacting with mTBI increased the risk of AD phenotype development with language dysfunction.

                Material perception is essential in planning interactions with the environment. The visual system relies on diagnostic image features to achieve material perception efficiently. However, discovering the features, especially for translucent materials, has been challenging due to the high variability of material appearances under interactions of shape, lighting, and intrinsic materials. Here, we learn a latent space informative of human translucency perception by developing a deep generative network trained to synthesize images of perceptually persuasive material appearances. Without supervision, human-interpretable scene attributes, including object's shape, material, and body color, spontaneously emerge in the latent space in a scale-specific manner. Critically, the middle-layers of the latent space selectively encode the translucency features correlating with perception, suggesting that translucent impressions are established in the mid-to-low spatial scale features. Our findings illustrate the promising capability of unsupervised learning in finding representative dimensions for materials and discovering perceptually relevant features for visual inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localized network hyperconnectivity leads to hyperexcitability after injury</a></h4>

              
                Brain injury increases the risk of the development of epilepsy. Axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis are homeostatically mediated responses by neurons to injury-induced de-afferentation and de-efferentation. Rewiring which occurs due to axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis may alter network excitability and lead to epilepsy. Excitatory and inhibitory connectivity are both subject to homeostatic rewiring. Thus, post-sprouting hyperexcitability cannot be simply explained as result of altered inhibitory/excitatory balance. In this work, we show computationally and experimentally that hyperconnected local networks are created by homeostatic rewiring near the injury site. These local networks are characterized by altered system dynamics despite preservation of excitatory/inhibitory balance. Hyperconnected local networks have a lower threshold for burst initiation, and generate spontaneous bursts, which in turn ignite seizure-like activity in the larger network. Our findings demonstrate a novel network mechanism of hyperexcitability and seizure generation due to maladaptive recovery after injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object recognition for natural images and line drawings</a></h4>

              
                Drawings offer a simple and efficient way to communicate meaning. While line drawings capture only coarsely how objects look in reality, we still perceive them as resembling real-world objects. Previous work has shown that this perceived similarity is mirrored by shared neural representations for drawings and natural images, which suggests that similar mechanisms underlie the recognition of both. However, other work has proposed that representations of drawings and natural images become similar only after substantial processing has taken place, suggesting distinct mechanisms. To arbitrate between those alternatives, we measured brain responses resolved in space and time using fMRI and MEG, respectively, while participants viewed images of objects depicted as photographs, line drawings, or sketch-like drawings. Using multivariate decoding, we demonstrate that object category information emerged similarly fast and across overlapping regions in occipital and ventral-temporal cortex for all types of depiction, yet with smaller effects at higher levels of visual abstraction. In addition, cross-decoding between depiction types revealed strong generalization of object category information from early processing stages on. Finally, by combining fMRI and MEG data using representational similarity analysis, we found that visual information traversed similar processing stages for all types of depiction, yet with an overall stronger representation for photographs. Together our results demonstrate broad commonalities in the neural dynamics of object recognition across types of depiction, thus providing clear evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying recognition of natural object images and abstract drawings.

	<p>The incidence of stroke and the burden on health care and society are expected to increase significantly in the coming years, due to the increasing aging of the population. Various sensory, motor, cognitive and psychological disorders may remain in the patient after survival from a stroke. In hemiplegic patients with movement disorders, the impairment of upper limb function, especially hand function, dramatically limits the ability of patients to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, one of the essential goals of post-stroke rehabilitation is to restore hand function. The recovery of motor function is achieved chiefly through compensatory strategies, such as hand rehabilitation robots, which have been available since the end of the last century. This paper reviews the current research status of hand function rehabilitation devices based on various types of hand motion recognition technologies and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages, reviews the application of artificial intelligence in hand rehabilitation robots, and summarizes the current research limitations and discusses future research directions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To investigate the altered functional connectivity (FC) of the cerebral hemispheres in patients with morbid obesity (MO) with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Methods: Patients and matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and all subjects underwent functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI), and VMHC results were processed statistically to assess the differences in FC in different brain regions between the two groups. We further used ROC curves to evaluate the diagnostic value of these differences. We also used Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis to explore the relationship between changes in VMHC values in specific brain regions, visual acuity, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Conclusions: Patients with morbid obesity and MGD had abnormal FC in the cerebral hemispheres in several specific brain areas, which were mainly concentrated in pathways related to vision and perception and may correlate to some extent with the clinical presentations of the patients.</p>

	<p>Stress may serve multiple roles in cerebral functioning, ranging from a highly appropriate behavioral adaptation to a critical risk factor for susceptibility to mood disorder and cognitive impairment. It is well known that E/I (excitation/inhibition) balance is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. However, it remains largely unknown how GABAergic and Glutamatergic neurons respond to different stressful stimuli and whether the GABAergic-Glutamatergic neuron balance is related to the transition between adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Here, we subjected 3-month-old mice to chronic mild stress (CMS) for a period of one, two, and four weeks, respectively. The results showed that the two-week CMS procedure produced adaptive effects on behaviors and cognitive performance, with a higher number of GABAergic neuron and VGluT1-positive neurons, increasing the expressions of p-GluN2B, Reelin, and syn-PSD-95 protein in the hippocampus. In contrast, the prolonged behavioral challenge (4 week) imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy and cognitive impairment, decreased the number of GABAergic neuron, hyperactivity of VGluT1-positive neuron, increased the ratio of p-GluN2B, and decreased the expression of Reelin, syn-PSD-95 in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that a moderate duration of stress probably promotes behavioral adaptation and spatial memory by maintaining a GABAergic-Glutamatergic neuron balance and promoting the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the brain.</p>

	<p>In the last decades, it has been proposed that executive functions may be particularly vulnerable to weight-related issues. However, evidence on the matter is mixed, especially when the effects of sociodemographic variables are weighted. Thus, the current study aimed at further examining the relationship between executive functions and obesity. To this aim, we compared treatment-seeking overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients with normal-weight control participants. We examined general executive functioning (Frontal Assessment Battery&amp;amp;ndash;15) and different executive subdomains (e.g., inhibitory control, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed) in a clinical sample including 208 outpatients with different degrees of BMI (52 overweight, BMI 25&amp;amp;ndash;30, M age = 34.38; 76 obese, BMI 30&amp;amp;ndash;40, M age = 38.00; 80 morbidly obese, BMI &amp;amp;gt; 40, M age = 36.20). Ninety-six normal-weight subjects served as controls. No difference on executive scores was detected when obese patients were compared with over- or normal-weight subjects. Morbidly obese patients reported lower performance on executive scores than obese, overweight, and normal-weight subjects. Between-group difference emerged also when relevant covariates were taken into account. Our results support the view that morbid obesity is associated with lower executive performance, also considering the critical role exerted by sociodemographic (i.e., sex, age, and education) variables. Our results support the view that executive functioning should be accounted into the management of the obese patient because of non-negligible clinical relevance in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic terms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes in the retinorecipient superior colliculus display unique cellular and structural properties</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes have long been considered to be a largely homogeneous cell population. Recent studies however suggest that astrocytes are highly adapted to the local neuronal circuitry. Glucose utilization in the retinorecipient superior colliculus (SC) is one of the highest in the brain. Since metabolic support to neurons is a major function of astrocytes, they could be of particular relevance in this region and display specific features. However, little is known about astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in this multisensory brain area. We thus here investigated region-specific cellular and structural properties of astrocytes in the visual layer of the SC. Using morphological reconstructions, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and superresolution imaging, we found that astrocytes from the visual layers of the SC are highly distinct with a higher cellular density, a more complex morphology and a stronger proximity to synapses compared to astrocytes from the primary visual cortex and the hippocampus. These data point to astroglial diversity and specialization within neural circuits integrating sensory information in the adult brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cognitive basis of intracranial self-stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Recently there has been a reckoning in the dopamine field. This has suggested that the dopamine prediction error may function as a teaching signal, without endowing preceding events with value. We studied the cognitive basis of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a setting where dopamine appears to be valuable. Physiological frequencies seen during reinforcement learning did not support robust ICSS or promote behavior that would indicate the stimulation was represented as a meaningful reward in a specific or general sense. This was despite demonstrating that this same physiologically-relevant signal could function as a teaching signal. However, supraphysiological frequencies supported robust ICSS where the stimulation was represented as a specific sensory event, which acted as a goal to motivate behavior. This demonstrates that dopamine neurons only support ICSS at supraphysiological frequencies, and in a manner that does not reflect our subjective experience with endogenous firing of dopamine neurons during reinforcement learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D Direttissima: A V1 Heresy</a></h4>

              
                The heretical conjecture offered here is that a 3-space scene reconstruction of sequences of visual fixations is constructed directly in V1 in a head-centered frame. Direttissima is a climbing term designating the shortest, most direct route to the objective of a climb. The heresy here is the claim that the construction of the first 3D representation of the scene takes place in V1 rather than further up the visual pathways. The inputs to the neural process proposed for such construction are the V1 retinotopic projections from each eye and the vergence angle. Absolute disparities are not encoded as a separate data set in a distinct set of neurons, but rather are emergent properties of the neurons that implement the construction of the 3D representation of one or a sequence of fixations on elements of the scene. In this conjecture, the conscious picture we take as vision is a projection of the 3D construction, not a view of the retinal image. One of the critical psychophysical clues to the nature of such a mechanism is the well known visual size constancy phenomenon. Another property of the proposed mechanism is that it is plausibly fast enough to enable such spatially and temporally demanding tasks as a human batting a fastball or a bobcat swatting the head of a striking rattlesnake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging increased metabolism in the spinal cord in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence indicates crosstalk between the brain and the hematopoietic system follow-ing cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated metabolism and oxygenation in the spleen and spinal cord in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model that is wide-ly used in focal cerebral ischemia research. Naive, sham and tMCAO mice underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for assessing glucose me-tabolism and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) assisted with quantitative model-based reconstruction and unmixing algorithms for accurate mapping of oxygenation patterns in the peripheral tissues at 24 h after reperfusion. We found increased levels of [18F]FDG uptake and reduced MSOT oxygen saturation, indicating hypoxia in the thoracic spinal cord of tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice but not in the spleen. A positive correlation was observed between splenic and ipsilateral striatal [18F]FDG uptake. Reduced spleen size was observed in tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice ex vivo. tMCAO led to a significant increase in the numbers of mature T cells (CD4 and CD8) in femoral bone marrow tissues, concomitant with a stark reduction in these cell subsets in the spleen and their decrease in periph-eral blood. The numbers of mature granulocytes (determined as CD11b+Gr1hi cells) decreased in bone marrow tissues and blood but increased in the spleen. The combination of quantitative PET and MSOT thus enabled the observation of hypoxia and increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of tMCAO mice at 24 h after occlusion compared to sham-operated mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in behavioral priority influence the accessibility but not the quality of working memory content.</a></h4>

              
                Efficient behavioral selection requires rapid comparisons of sensory inputs with internal representations of motor affordances and goal states, and many of these comparisons take place in working memory (WM). Selecting an item stored in WM is known to blunt and/or reverse information loss in stimulus-specific representations of that item reconstructed from human brain activity, but extant studies have focused on all-or-none circumstances that allow or prevent an agent from selecting one item stored in WM. Behavioral studies suggest that humans can flexibly assign different levels of priority to different items stored in WM, but how doing so influences neural representations of WM content is unclear. One possibility is that assigning different levels of priority to items in memory influences the quality of those representations, resulting in more robust neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content. A second (non-exclusive) possibility is that asymmetries in behavioral priority influence how rapidly neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content can be selected and reported. To test these alternatives, we decoded high- and low-priority WM content from EEG recordings obtained while human volunteers performed a retrospectively cued WM task. Probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of a remembered item had no effect on asymptotic decoding performance; instead, these changes influenced the latency at which peak decoding performance was reached. Thus, our results indicate that probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of WM content influence the ease with which memories can be accessed and retrieved independently of their strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Dual Role for LAR-RPTP in Regulating Long-distance Transport and Synaptic Retention of AMPARs, Essential for Long Term Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                The AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) plays an essential role in excitatory synaptic transmission, learning, and memory. The majority of AMPARs are made in the cell body and are transported by molecular motors to synapses. Maintaining the proper number of synaptic receptors requires coordinated regulation of receptor production, export from the soma and delivery at synapses. This major logistical process is essential for circuit function and behavior. Although recent studies have shown that long-distance synaptic transport is regulated by neuronal activity, little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate somatic export or synaptic delivery and removal. Here we show that loss of the PTP-3A isoform of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP-3 (the C. elegans homologue of vertebrate LAR-RPTP) leads to a ~60% decrease in AMPAR transport; this affects synaptic delivery of AMPARs and synaptic functions necessary for long-term associative olfactory memory in C. elegans. Interestingly, while complete loss of PTP-3A leads to defects in transport and local synaptic trafficking of AMPARs, loss of only PTP-3 phosphatase function affects local synaptic recycling and retention of AMPARs. Finally, we show that the N-terminus of PTP-3A regulates transport, whereas the C-terminal regulates synaptic retention of AMPARs. Altogether, our results suggest a model in which the two domains of PTP-3/LAR-RPTPs have specific, complementary roles in coordinating somatic export and local retention of AMPARs essential for long-term associative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anandamide reduces excitability by preferentially targeting somatic VGSCs via CB1</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is vital for important brain functions and can be modified pharmacologically to treat pain, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Endocannabinoid mediated changes to excitability are predominantly attributed to 2-arachidonoylglycerol at synapses. Here we identify a pathway in the neocortex by which anandamide, the other major endocannabinoid, powerfully inhibits sodium conductances in the soma resulting in a loss of neuronal excitability. This pathway is mediated by the cannabinoid receptor, and its activation results in a decrease of recurrent action potential generation. The synthetic cannabinoid, Win-55, also inhibits VGSC currents indicating this pathway is positioned to mediate the actions of exogenous cannabinoids.

	<p>Endovascular interventional is an important treatment method for intracranial aneurysms. However, due to the risk of intracranial thrombosis, prophylactic use of antiplatelet drugs is generally required. Clinically, the most commonly used drugs are aspirin and clopidogrel; although the latter can significantly reduce the incidence of thromboembolic complications, there are still some patients with clopidogrel resistance who have ischemic adverse events during antiplatelet therapy. In this study, cohort studies of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library Databases were retrieved to compare the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in endovascular interventional treatment of intracranial aneurysms. A total of 10 cohort studies involving 1377 patients were included in this study. All patients had intracranial aneurysms and underwent endovascular intervention. Platelet function was measured in four of the studies and switched the patients with clopidogrel resistance to ticagrelor, while the remaining six studies did not test platelet function, but were also treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The results of the study showed that ticagrelor, like clopidogrel, can effectively control thrombotic complications in endovascular interventional patients, and also control the occurrence of ischemic complications in clopidogrel-resistant patients. Ticagrelor, as a novel platelet aggregation inhibitor that can reversibly bind to P2Y12 receptor, can effectively control thromboembolic complications without increasing hemorrhagic complications, and is also effective in patients with clopidogrel resistance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau Mediates Synergistic Influence of Vascular Risk and Aβ on Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5 ± 8.0 years). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Aβ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET). Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6 ± 1.5 years) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0 ± 2.0 years) using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Aβ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and Aβ on greater ITC tau accumulation (<i>p</i> = 0.004), even in individuals with Aβ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Aβ on longitudinal tau (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and Aβ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Aβ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Aβ-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor blockade reveal differences in hippocampal local field potentials in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We hypothesize that hippocampal local field potentials in acetylcholine (ACh)-deficient mutant mice, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, will show lower sensitivity to muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but higher sensitivity to NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were made during walk and awake-immobility (IMM) in WT mice, and in mice with forebrain knockout (KO) of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene, or heterozygous knockdown of VAChT gene (KD). Scopolamine or CPP did not significantly alter walk theta frequency, which was higher in KD than WT/KO mice. Scopolamine decreased theta power peak rise during walk in WT/KD mice but not in KO mice, while CPP suppressed theta peak rise more in WT/KO mice than KD mice. During IMM, scopolamine decreased gamma1 (γ1, 30–58 Hz) power more in KD/WT mice than KO mice, while delta (1–4 Hz) power and delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence (CFC) were increased in all mouse groups during IMM or walk. During walk, scopolamine increased delta and beta (13–30 Hz) power and decreased gamma2 (γ2, 62–100 Hz) power and theta-γ2 CFC more in WT/KD than KO mice. Theta-γ2, but not theta-γ1, CFC increased with theta-peak-frequency in WT/KD mice, and was suppressed by scopolamine at high theta (8–10 Hz) frequency; theta-γ2 CFC in KO mice was not significantly altered by scopolamine. CPP decreased beta and gamma power more in KD/KO mice compared to WT mice, while delta power and delta-gamma CFC were increased in all mouse groups. ACh deficiency exacerbates the attenuation of beta and gamma power by CPP. We conclude that both muscarinic and NMDA transmission contribute toward hippocampal theta, beta, and gamma power, and a decrease in gamma power or theta-gamma CFC may be associated with loss of arousal and cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Low heart rate is associated with cerebral pulsatility after TIA or minor stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Beta-blockers are beneficial in coronary artery disease but less so in stroke prevention and dementia, potentially due to reduced heart rate (HR). Cerebral pulsatility is strongly associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and may be increased by lower diastolic pressures resulting from longer cardiac cycles.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients 4-6 weeks after TIA or non-disabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study) underwent 5 minutes continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP), ECG and middle cerebral artery flow velocity (transcranial ultrasound). Beat-to-beat relationships between HR, blood pressure and Gosling's pulsatility index (MCA-PI) are reported as beta-coefficients from general linear models for each individual.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Across 759 patients, average MCA-PI during monitoring was associated with lower HR and DBP and greater SBP (∆MCA-PI per 10 bpm/mmHg: -0.02, -0.04, 0.03, all p&lt;0.001), with HR particularly associated with low end-diastolic cerebral velocity (0.86, p=0.014). Beat-to-beat heart rate was strongly associated with concurrent low DBP and high SBP, potentially mediating the association with greater beat-to-beat cerebral pulsatility (average ∆MCA-PI vs HR/DBP/SBP unadjusted: -0.062, -0.052, 0.0092; adjusted for concurrent BP: -0.039, -0.11, 0.041). The beat-to-beat association between HR and MCA-PI increased with age, beta-blockers, arterial stiffness, low HR (age&gt;70+HR&lt;65 versus age&lt;70+HR&gt;65: -0.081 vs -0.024, interaction p&lt;0.001) and severe SVD on MRI (age&gt;70+severe versus age&lt;70+none: -0.087 vs -0.047, interaction p=0.03), with interactions between age, severe SVD and low HR synergistically increasing MCA-PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Low heart rate is associated with greater cerebral pulsatility in patients with SVD, potentially mediated by lower diastolic blood flow and representing a novel potential treatment target.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and the risk of hematoma expansion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Importance</h2>
<p>We assessed whether hematoma expansion (HE) and favorable outcome differs according to type of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Among participants with ICH enrolled in the TICH-2 trial, we assessed baseline scans for hematoma location and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) using CT and MRI (Edinburgh/Boston criteria) and categorized ICH as lobar CAA, lobar non-CAA, and non-lobar. The main outcomes were HE and favorable functional outcome. We constructed multivariate regression models and assessed treatment effects using interaction terms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>2298 of 2325 participants were included with available CT (98.8%; median age 71years IQR 60-80years; 1014 female). Additional MRI was available in 219 patients (9.5%). Overall, 1637 participants (71.2%) had non-lobar ICH, the remaining 661 participants (28.8%) had lobar ICH, of which 202 patients had lobar CAA-ICH (8.8%, 173 participants according to Edinburgh and 29 participants according to Boston criteria) and 459 did not (lobar non-CAA, 20.0%). For HE, we found a significant interaction between lobar CAA ICH and time-from-onset-to-randomization (increasing risk with time; p<sub>interaction</sub>&lt;0.001) and baseline ICH volume (constant risk regardless of volume, p<sub>interaction</sub>&lt;0.001) but no association between type of ICH with risk of HE or favorable outcome. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the risk of HE (aOR 0.7; 95%CI 0.6-1.0, p=0.020) without statistically significant interaction with type of ICH (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.058). Tranexamic acid was not associated with favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Risk of HE in patients with lobar CAA-ICH was not independently increased but seems to have different dynamics compared to other types of ICH. The time window for treatment of CAA-ICH to prevent HE may be longer.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RatInABox: A toolkit for modelling locomotion and neuronal activity in continuous environments</a></h4>

              
                Generating synthetic locomotory and electrophysiological data is a necessary yet cumbersome step required to study theoretical models of the brain's role in spatial navigation. This process can be time consuming and, without a common framework, makes it difficult to reproduce or compare studies which each generate test data in different ways. In response we present RatInABox, an open-source Python toolkit designed to model realistic rodent locomotion and generate synthetic electrophysiological data from spatially modulated cell types. This software provides users with (i) the ability to construct one- or two-dimensional environments with configurable barriers and rewards, (ii) a realistic motion model for random foraging fitted to experimental data (iii) rapid online calculation of neural data for some of the known self-location or velocity selective cell types in the hippocampal formation (including place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, head direction cells) and (iv) a framework for constructing custom cell types as well as multi-layer network models. Cell activity and the motion model are spatially and temporally continuous and topographically sensitive to boundary conditions and walls. We demonstrate that out-of-the-box parameter settings replicate many aspects of rodent foraging behaviour such as velocity statistics and the tendency of rodents to over-explore walls. Numerous tutorial scripts are provided, including examples in which RatInABox is used for decoding position from neural data, reinforcement learning, or to set up an example circuit capable of learning path integration. We hope this tool significantly streamlines the process of theory-driven research into the brain's role in navigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatio-temporal summation of perimetric stimuli in healthy observers</a></h4>

              
                Spatial summation of perimetric stimuli have been used to derive conclusions about the spatial extent of retinal-cortical convergence, mostly from the size of the critical area of summation (Ricco's area, RA) and critical number of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs). However, spatial summation is known to change dynamically with stimulus duration. Conversely, temporal summation and critical duration also vary with stimulus size. Such an important and often neglected spatio-temporal interaction has important implications for modelling perimetric sensitivity in healthy observers and formulate hypotheses for changes measured in disease. In this work, we performed experiments on visually heathy observers confirming the interaction of stimulus size and duration in determining summation responses in photopic conditions. We then propose a simplified computational model that captures these aspects of perimetric sensitivity by modelling the total retinal input, the combined effect of stimulus size, duration and retinal cones-to-RGC ratio. We additionally show that, in the macula, the enlargement of RA with eccentricity might not correspond to a constant critical number of RGCs, as often reported, but to a constant critical total retinal input. We finally compare our results with previous literature and show possible implications for modelling disease, especially glaucoma.

                How transient hyperglycemia contributes to cerebro-vascular disease has been a challenge to study under controlled conditions. We present an approach to model luminal vessel thrombo-inflammation using amplified, ultrashort laser-pulses to physically disrupt brain-venule endothelium. Vessel disruption in conjunction with transient hyperglycemia from a single injection of metabolically active D glucose results in real-time responses to venule damage that include rapid serum extravasation, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil recruitment, in normal mice. In contrast, vessel thrombo-inflammation following laser-induced vessel disruption is significantly reduced in mice injected with metabolically inert L-glucose. Thrombo-inflammation is pharmacologically ameliorated by a platelet inhibitor, by a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, or by a nitric oxide donor. For comparison, in diabetic mice injured vessel thrombo-inflammatory responses are also reduced by restoration of normo-glycemia. Our approach provides a controlled method to probe synergies of transient metabolic and physical vascular perturbations and reveals new aspects of brain pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microstimulation of human somatosensory cortex evokes task-dependent, spatially patterned responses in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex (S1) can be used to restore tactile feedback to people with spinal cord injury via brain controlled bionic hands. Anatomical and neurophysiological evidence from various animal species points to a communication pathway between motor and somatosensory cortex, but this pathway's normal function, and its relevance to neuroprosthetics, remains to be elucidated. To fill this gap, we delivered - in three human participants whose hands were paralyzed as a result of a spinal cord injury - ICMS to the somatosensory cortex (S1) while recording the responses evoked in the hand and arm representations of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that ICMS activated some M1 neurons at short, fixed latencies, locked to each pulse in a manner consistent with monosynaptic activation. However, most of the changes in M1 firing rates were much more variable in time, suggesting a more indirect effect of the stimulation. The spatial pattern of M1 activation varied systematically depending on the stimulating electrode: S1 electrodes that elicited percepts at a given hand location tended to activate M1 neurons with movement fields at the same location. However, the indirect effects of S1 ICMS on M1 were strongly context dependent, such that the magnitude and even sign relative to baseline varied across tasks. We tested the implications of these effects for brain-control of a virtual hand, in which ICMS was used to convey tactile feedback about object interactions. While ICMS-evoked activation of M1 disrupted decoder performance, this disruption could be minimized with biomimetic stimulation, which emphasizes contact transients at the onset and offset of grasp, reduces sustained stimulation, and has been shown to convey useful contact-related information.

                Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces action potentials to induce plastic changes in the brain with increasing evidence for the therapeutic importance of brain-wide functional network effects of rTMS; however, the influence of sub-action potential threshold (low-intensity; LI-) rTMS on neuronal activity is largely unknown. Hypothesis: We investigated whether LI-rTMS modulates neuronal activity and functional connectivity. We also specifically assessed modulation of parvalbumin interneuron activity. Methods: We conducted a brain-wide analysis of c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in mice that received LI-rTMS to visual cortex. Mice received single or multiple sessions of excitatory 10Hz LI-rTMS with custom rodent coils or were sham controls. We assessed changes to c-Fos positive cell densities and c-Fos/parvalbumin co-expression. Peak c-Fos expression corresponded with activity during rTMS. We also assessed functional connectivity changes using brain-wide c-Fos-based network analysis. Results: LI-rTMS modulated c-Fos expression in cortical and subcortical regions. c-Fos density changes were most prevalent with acute stimulation, however chronic stimulation decreased parvalbumin interneuron activity, most prominently in the amygdala and striatum. LI-rTMS also increased anti-correlated functional connectivity, with the most prominent effects also in the amygdala and striatum following chronic stimulation. Conclusion: LI-rTMS induces changes in c-Fos expression that suggest modulation of neuronal activity and functional connectivity throughout the brain. Our results suggest that LI-rTMS promotes anticorrelated functional connectivity, possibly due to decreased parvalbumin interneuron activation induced by chronic stimulation. These changes may underpin therapeutic rTMS effects, therefore modulation of subcortical activity supports rTMS for treatment of disorders involving subcortical dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endocannabinoid-dependent persistent decrease of GABAergic transmission on dopaminergic neurons underlies gene-environment interaction-induced susceptibility to cocaine sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Vulnerability to develop cocaine use disorder depends upon an unpredictable combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Early life adversity and adolescence are critical non-genetic risk factors, and haplotypes of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) genes are among genetic variations increasing the risk of drug-related problems. However, data on the interactions between inheritable risk factors and early life stress (ES) with respect to predisposition to cocaine abuse are limited. Here, we show that a mouse model containing both genetic (low-activity alleles of the MAO A gene; MAOANeo) and environmental (i.e., ES) variables displays a long lasting increased sensitivity to repeated in vivo cocaine psychomotor stimulant actions associated with a reduction of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-dependent form of short-term plasticity, also becomes readily expressed by dopamine neurons from MAOANeoES mice treated repeatedly with cocaine. Activation of either dopamine D2 or CB1 receptors is required for cocaine-induced DSI expression, decreased GABA synaptic efficacy, and hyperlocomotion. Next, in vivo pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG signaling during repeated cocaine exposure occludes its actions both in vivo and ex vivo. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by this gene by environment interaction in VTA dopamine neurons of male pre-adolescent mice, contributing to our understanding of neural mechanisms of vulnerability for early onset cocaine use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Structural Connectivity Atlas of Limbic Brainstem Nuclei</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the structural connectivity of key brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical regions is essential to the development of therapeutic neuromodulation for depression, chronic pain, addiction, anxiety and movement disorders. Several brainstem nuclei have been identified as the primary central nervous system (CNS) source of important monoaminergic ascending fibers including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. However, due to practical challenges to their study, there is limited data regarding their in vivo anatomic connectivity in humans. To evaluate the structural connectivity of the following brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical areas: locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, to develop a group average atlas of these limbic brainstem structures to facilitate future analyses. Each nucleus was manually masked from 197 Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural MRI images using FSL software. Probabilistic tractography was performed using FSL's FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Connectivity with limbic cortical regions was calculated and compared between brainstem nuclei. Results were aggregated to produce a freely available MNI structural atlas of limbic brainstem structures. A general trend was observed for a high probability of connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus and DLPFC with relatively lower connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and insula. The locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius demonstrated significantly greater connectivity to the DLPFC than amygdala while the periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area did not demonstrate a significant difference between these two structures. Monoaminergic and other modulatory nuclei in the brainstem project widely to cortical limbic regions. We describe the structural connectivity across the several key brainstem nuclei theorized to influence emotion, reward, and cognitive functions. An increased understanding of the anatomic basis of the brainstem's role in emotion and other reward-related processing will support targeted neuromodulatary therapies aimed at alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical integration of multi-omics data identifies potential therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are characterized by aggregation of the alpha-synuclein protein in the brain. The causes and consequences of this aggregation are currently unclear, hampering the development of an effective therapy against these synucleinopathies. To gain understanding in the neurobiological events underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation, LUHMES cell lines have been utilized to measure transcriptomics and proteomics data and perform differential regulation analyses. The LUHMES cells have also been used to screen 1600 FDA-approved drugs for their ability to reduce alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. We implemented a probabilistic data integration method, POPLS-DA, to model alpha-synuclein overexpression in terms of the transcriptomics and proteomics data jointly. Using POPLS-DA, we selected 200 relevant genes and proteins and integrated this gene list with the FDA drugs that were validated to be protective against alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity. Using interactome and functional enrichment analyses, we identified clusters of synaptic and lysosome-related genes and proteins that were targeted by the protective drugs. We found that HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, was one of the most targeted genes by the validated drugs. Our integrative approach results provide new directions for therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG signature of breaks in embodiment in VR</a></h4>

              
                The brain mechanism of embodiment in a virtual body has grown a scientific interest recently, with a particular focus on providing optimal virtual reality (VR) experiences. Disruptions from an embodied state to a less- or non-embodied state, denominated Breaks in Embodiment (BiE), are however rarely studied despite their importance for designing interactions in VR. Here we use electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the brain's reaction to a BiE, and investigate how this reaction depends on previous embodiment conditions. The experimental protocol consisted of two sequential steps; an induction step where participants were either embodied or non-embodied in an avatar, and a monitoring step where, in some cases, participants saw the avatar's hand move while their hand remained still. Our results show the occurrence of error-related potentials linked to observation of the BiE event in the monitoring step. Importantly, this EEG signature shows amplified potentials following the non-embodied condition, which is indicative of an accumulation of errors across steps. These results provide neurophysiological indications on how progressive disruptions impact the expectation of embodiment for a virtual body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRPM3 as novel target to alleviate acute oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP) is an adverse effect observed in up to 80% of cancer patients upon treatment with cytostatic drugs including paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. CIPNP can be so severe that it limits dose and choice of chemotherapy, and has a significant negative consequences on the quality of life of survivors. Current treatments for CIPNP are limited and unsatisfactory. TRPM3 is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel functionally expressed in peripheral sensory neurons involved in the detection of thermal stimuli. Here, we focus on the possible involvement of TRPM3 in acute oxaliplatin induced mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity. In vitro calcium microfluorimetry and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that TRPM3 is functionally upregulated in both heterologous and homologous expression systems after acute (24h) oxaliplatin treatment, while direct application of oxaliplatin was without effect. In vivo behavioral studies using an acute oxaliplatin model for CIPNP showed the development of cold and mechano-hypersensitivity in control mice, which was lacking in TRPM3 deficient mice. In addition, the levels of pERK, a marker for neuronal activity, were significantly lower in DRG neurons derived from TRPM3 deficient mice compared to control after oxaliplatin administration. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of a TRPM3 antagonist, isosakuranetin, effectively reduced the oxaliplatin-induced pain behavior in response to cold and mechanical stimulation in mice with an acute form of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. In summary, TRPM3 thus represents a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local brain oscillations and inter-regional connectivity differentially serve sensory and expectation effects on pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain emerges from the integration of sensory information about threats and contextual information such as an individual's expectations. However, how sensory and contextual effects on pain are served by the brain is not fully understood so far. To address this question, we applied brief painful stimuli to 40 healthy human participants and independently varied stimulus intensity and expectations. Concurrently, we recorded electroencephalography. We assessed local oscillatory brain activity and inter-regional functional connectivity in a network of six brain regions playing key roles in the processing of pain. We found that sensory information predominantly influenced local brain oscillations. In contrast, expectations exclusively influenced inter-regional connectivity. Specifically, expectations altered connectivity at alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies from prefrontal to somatosensory cortex. Moreover, discrepancies between sensory information and expectations, i.e., prediction errors, influenced connectivity at gamma (60-100 Hz) frequencies. These findings reveal how fundamentally different brain mechanisms serve sensory and contextual effects on pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical distribution of neurofilaments associates with pathological hallmarks and MRI measures of atrophy and diffusivity in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Increased neurofilament levels in biofluids, commonly used as a proxy for axonal degeneration in the brain, have been found in Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and to correlate with MRI biomarkers. The aim of the current study was to unravel the regional distribution of cortical neurofilaments and their association with pathology load and MRI measures of atrophy and diffusivity in the post-mortem brain. Using a within-subject post-mortem MRI-pathology approach, we included 9 PD, 12 PDD/DLB and 18 age-matched control donors. Cortical thickness and mean diffusivity (MD) metrics were extracted respectively from 3DT1 and DTI at 3T in-situ MRI. After autopsy, pSer129 alpha-synuclein (pSer129-Syn), p-tau, and amyloid-beta, together with neurofilament light-chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament medium- and heavy-chain (p-NfM/H) immunoreactivity were quantified in 7 cortical regions, and studied in detail with confocal-laser scanning microscopy. The correlations between MRI and pathological measures were studied using linear mixed models. Compared to controls, p-NfM/H immunoreactivity was increased in all cortical regions in PD and PDD/DLB, whereas NfL immunoreactivity was mainly increased in the parahippocampal and entorhinal cortex in PDD/DLB. NfL-positive neurons showed degenerative morphological features and axonal fragmentation. Increased p-NfM/H correlated with p-tau load, and NfL correlated with pSer129-Syn but more strongly with p-tau load in PDD/DLB. Lastly, neurofilament immunoreactivity correlated with cortical thinning in PD and with increased cortical MD in PDD/DLB. Taken together, increased neurofilament immunoreactivity suggests underlying axonal injury and neurofilament accumulation in morphologically altered neurons with increasing pathological burden. Importantly, we demonstrate that such neurofilament markers at least partly explain MRI measures that are associated with the neurodegenerative process.

	<p>Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common postoperative complication, particularly in older patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, a non-invasive technique with a high spatial&amp;amp;ndash;temporal resolution, can accurately characterize the dynamic changes in brain function during the perioperative period. Current clinical studies have confirmed that the power density of alpha oscillation during general anesthesia decreased with age, which was considered to be associated with increased susceptibility to PND in the elderly. However, evidence on whether general anesthesia under EEG guidance results in a lower morbidity of PND is still contradictory. This is one of the reasons that common indicators of the depth of anesthesia were limitedly derived from EEG signals in the frontal lobe. The variation of multi-channel EEG features during the perioperative period has the potential to highlight the occult structural and functional abnormalities of the subcortical&amp;amp;ndash;cortical neurocircuit. Therefore, we present a review of the application of multi-channel EEG monitoring to predict the incidence of PND in older patients. The data confirmed that the abnormal variation in EEG power and functional connectivity between distant brain regions was closely related to the incidence and long-term poor outcomes of PND in older adults.</p>

	<p>Flow diverters (FD) have become the mainstay for the endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Most FD procedures are performed under general anesthesia, and the influence of local anesthesia (LA) on outcomes remains unknown. This study evaluated the results of FD placement under LA. Data of patients treated for FD under LA between August 2016 and January 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0&amp;amp;ndash;2. Major stroke, steno-occlusive events of FD, mortality, and satisfactory aneurysm occlusion were also evaluated. In total, 169 patients undertook 182 treatments (139 [82%) female, mean age 61 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years). The median maximum aneurysm size was 9.5 mm (interquartile range 6.1-14 mm). A flow re-directed endoluminal device and pipeline embolization device were used in 103 (57%) and 78 (43%) treatments. One patient (0.59%) experienced major stroke, and steno-occlusive events were observed in four patients (2.4%). A good outcome at 90 days was obtained in 164 patients (98%), and one patient died (0.59% mortality). During the median follow-up period of 345 days (interquartile range 176&amp;amp;ndash;366 days), satisfactory aneurysm occlusion was observed in 126 of 160 aneurysms (79%). Our results suggest that FD placement under LA is a safe and effective treatment for UIA.</p>

	<p>The main objective of this study was to examine whether increased levels of inattentive (INA) and hyperactive/impulsive (H/I) behaviours were associated with lower scores on standardized tests of achievement in basic reading, spelling, and math skills, after accounting for certain known background risk factors and cognitive processes. Clinical assessment data from a rigorously diagnosed, stimulant-medication-na&amp;amp;iuml;ve sample of 354 elementary school-aged children experiencing academic difficulties and behavioural symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity were analyzed. Although higher scores of INA were significantly associated with lower scores in reading, spelling, and math, these associations did not persist when cognitive variables were added to the models. H/I was associated with math achievement, along with cognitive and background variables. Overall, cognitive variables accounted for the majority of the variance across basic reading, spelling, and math skills. Additionally, the only background demographic variables associated with academic achievement were age and sex for spelling and math. This finding highlights the importance of looking beyond observable INA and H/I behaviours to determine the underlying factors influencing academic achievement. Accurate identification of deficits in specific academic skills and the underlying factors influencing achievement in these skills are essential components in determining appropriate recommendations and targeted interventions.</p>

In the present study we investigated the ability to flexibly adjust CC as a function of implicit stimulus-response temporal regularities in preterm (PT; N = 21; mean age 8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years; gestational age 30 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.5 weeks) and full-term (FT; N = 20; mean age 8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) school-age children. All children underwent an HD-EEG recording while undergoing the Dynamic Temporal Prediction (DTP) task, a simple S1&amp;amp;ndash;S2 detection task purposely designed to generate local-global temporal predictability of imperative stimuli. The Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) was administered to measure explicit CC. The PT group showed more premature and slower (DTP) as well as perseverative (WCST) responses than the FT group. Moreover, pre-terms showed poor adaptive CC as revealed by less efficient global response-speed adjustment. This behavioral pattern was mirrored by a reduced and less sensitive to global manipulation anticipatory Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) and by different cortical source recruitment. These findings suggest that implicit CC may be a reliable endophenotypic marker of atypical cognitive development associated with preterm birth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mathematical model analysis and numerical simulation of intervention strategies to reduce transmission and re-activation of hepatitis B disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because of its asymptomatic nature, the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) has become the most lethal and silent killer. In this research, we offer HBV virus transmission characteristics in the form of a mathematical model. We suggested and examined a seven-compartment compartmental nonlinear deterministic mathematical model for transmission dynamics with immigration and HBV reactivation after recovery, as well as control measures for Hepatitis B virus disease transmission. By considering the following facts and cases, this work will provide new knowledge. First, re-infection of HBV after liver transplantation, chemotherapy, and other therapies is one of the most essential aspects in HBV transmission, although reactivation of HBV was not taken into account in some compartmental models of HBV transmission. Furthermore, the exposure rate, immigration rate, and level of infectiousness of the chronic infective class were not given enough weight in the numerical assessment of the force of HBV infection. These facts influenced the development of our model.  Methods: We demonstrated that the solution of the dynamical system under consideration is positive and bounded. The effective reproductive number that represents the epidemic indicator is generated from the biggest eigenvalue of the netgeneration matrix, and the model is examined qualitatively using differential equation stability theory. For disease-free and endemic equilibria, both local and global asymptotic stability criteria are determined.  Results: A full explanation of the parameters and their numerical findings is presented and debated well based on the numerical simulation. Conclusions: According to the findings of this study, vaccination and treatment interventions play a critical role in reducing HBV transmission and reproduction. It has also been demonstrated that HBV reactivation contributes significantly to an increase in theinfective population, which boosts virus transmission, and that a combination of vaccination and treatment will be the most effective strategy for controlling HBV infection and reinfection after recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">CYP2C19 polymorphism and coronary in-stent restenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major drawback in coronary stenting. The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. Methods: A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Publication bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I2 was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. Results: A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 40 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. The LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.84 [1.54–5.24], p = 0.0008). A major limitation in our study was the small number of previous studies and small sample sizes. Conclusions: Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher risk of developing ISR after coronary stenting.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of stress and its influencing factors among dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kingdom of Bahrain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is well known that all medical professions are linked to work stress, including dentistry, which is seen as facing high risk due to the nature of the job, especially the working conditions. This study aimed to assess the impact of stress and its influencing factors among dentists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Bahrain. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was designed to assess the impact of stress and its influencing factors among Bahraini dentists. A total of 306 participants were randomly selected from 1489 registered professionals in the NHRA (National Health Regulatory Authority Bahrain). Results: Out of 306 participants invited in the survey, 253 responded. Overall, the participants reported moderate stress. All the variables of the study showed different effects, but the highest stressor with a strong correlation was “fear of social isolation” (FI) at the significance level of 0.01 (β= 0.393, t= 5.090, p < 0.05= (0.000) with f2 = 0.201 above 0.15 and less than 0.35, which was considered as a moderate effect size of approximately (20%), which strongly supported the hypothesis that researchers have proposed. Overall, the total effect for all stressors was 30 % which was considered as a moderate effect size. All hypotheses were supported except Burden of caring for patients → OUTCOME due to insufficient evidence. R² values of independent variables were above 95% for the variance of dentists’ outcomes, which is considered an excellent fit to the data as evidenced by the squared multiple correlations (R2 ) values for the dependent variables. Conclusions: The study is unique based on its findings that reveal the impact of stress among dentists. Moreover, the results of this study may serve as guidance for future monitoring of dental practitioners’ burnout, anxiety, and workload.

                Background: This quasi-experimental study aimed to determine the effects of the ‘Our Love, Our Control’ online program on sexual health literacy and behaviors during the COVID-19 situation in Thailand from February 2020 to September 2021. Methods: Multistage sampling resulted in 37 and 34 participants in the experimental and control groups, respectively. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Fisher’s exact test/Chi-square test, and independent t-test/Mann-Whitney test were used to determine differences in sociodemographic variables between the experimental and control groups. Repeated measures of ANCOVA were used to compare the mean and 95% confidence intervals of the adjusted variables. Results: From the results, adolescents who had sexual intercourse experience had statistically significant differences at the eighth week of score for behaviors (23.92; 95% CI: 16.56; 31.29), and at the eighth and at the twentieth week of score for sexual health literacy (43.55; 95% CI: 28.10; 59.00; and 19.35; 95% CI: 0.23; 38.48, respectively). However, adolescents who had no sexual intercourse experience had statistically significant differences only at the eighth week of score for sexual health literacy. (11.20; 95% CI: 3.79; 18.61). Conclusions: These findings present a useful practical program to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, especially in sexually active adolescents.

                Background: Examining the prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy and understanding what motivates students to accept or reject a newly promoted vaccine has the potential in preventing rapid spread of infection and optimizing country-wide mass vaccination programs. This systematic review aimed to examine global COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among students, and to identify an up-to-date and concise assessment of most common factors influencing vaccine acceptance and hesitancy around the world. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed literatures indexed in reputable databases was performed. After obtaining the results via screening using PRISMA flow diagram, a total of 35 articles met the inclusion criteria and formed the basic structure of the study objectives. Results: The results revealed that, the worldwide pooled COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate was (x̅%)=29.8% (95% CI 23.37–36.23) among students. According to the country count assessment, the pooled vaccine hesitancy has been found to be ups and downs across the countries around the world such as  (x̅%)=32% (95% CI 20.04–43.97) in Asia, (x̅%)=(28.11%, 95% CI 18.83–37.40) in the United States, (x̅%)=15.59% (95% CI 8.23–22.95) in Europe, (x̅%)=55.93% (95% CI 40.31–71.55) in Africa, (x̅%)=20.4% in North America, and (x̅%)=22.5% in multi-ethnic areas in the reported student’s COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In total, 10 key factors were identified. “Side effect” 45.41% (95% CI 29.68–61.14), “safety” 42.27% (95% CI 27.50–57.04), and “trust” 44.95%, (95% CI 26.51–63.39) were the overarching concerns in making students' vaccination decisions. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied among the students; however, vaccine acceptance or refusal relies on several socio-psychological, societal, and vaccine related factors. This study helps the vaccine policy-makers and health stakeholders gain a better understanding of COVID-19 vaccination drive and design the vaccine promotion strategies. Health educational interventions could be the most preferred approach to improve student’s adherence and knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccination consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">De novo spatiotemporal modelling of cell-type signatures in the developmental human heart using graph convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sergio Marco Salas, Xiao Yuan, Christer Sylven, Mats Nilsson, Carolina Wählby, Gabriele Partel</p>

With the emergence of high throughput single cell techniques, the understanding of the molecular and cellular diversity of mammalian organs have rapidly increased. In order to understand the spatial organization of this diversity, single cell data is often integrated with spatial data to create probabilistic cell maps. However, targeted cell typing approaches relying on existing single cell data achieve incomplete and biased maps that could mask the true diversity present in a tissue slide. Here we applied a <i>de novo</i> technique to spatially resolve and characterize cellular diversity of in situ sequencing data during human heart development. We obtained and made accessible well defined spatial cell-type maps of fetal hearts from 4.5 to 9 post conception weeks, not biased by probabilistic cell typing approaches. With our analysis, we could characterize previously unreported molecular diversity within cardiomyocytes and epicardial cells and identified their characteristic expression signatures, comparing them with specific subpopulations found in single cell RNA sequencing datasets. We further characterized the differentiation trajectories of epicardial cells, identifying a clear spatial component on it. All in all, our study provides a novel technique for conducting de novo spatial-temporal analyses in developmental tissue samples and a useful resource for online exploration of cell-type differentiation during heart development at sub-cellular image resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Brain signal predictions from multi-scale networks using a linearized framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Espen Hagen, Steinn H. Magnusson, Torbjørn V. Ness, Geir Halnes, Pooja N. Babu, Charl Linssen, Abigail Morrison, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

Simulations of neural activity at different levels of detail are ubiquitous in modern neurosciences, aiding the interpretation of experimental data and underlying neural mechanisms at the level of cells and circuits. Extracellular measurements of brain signals reflecting transmembrane currents throughout the neural tissue remain commonplace. The lower frequencies (≲ 300Hz) of measured signals generally stem from synaptic activity driven by recurrent interactions among neural populations and computational models should also incorporate accurate predictions of such signals. Due to limited computational resources, large-scale neuronal network models (≳ 10<sup>6</sup> neurons or so) often require reducing the level of biophysical detail and account mainly for times of action potentials (‘spikes’) or spike rates. Corresponding extracellular signal predictions have thus poorly accounted for their biophysical origin.
Here we propose a computational framework for predicting spatiotemporal filter kernels for such extracellular signals stemming from synaptic activity, accounting for the biophysics of neurons, populations, and recurrent connections. Signals are obtained by convolving population spike rates by appropriate kernels for each connection pathway and summing the contributions. Our main results are that kernels derived via linearized synapse and membrane dynamics, distributions of cells, conduction delay, and volume conductor model allow for accurately capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ground truth extracellular signals from conductance-based multicompartment neuron networks. One particular observation is that changes in the effective membrane time constants caused by persistent synapse activation must be accounted for.
The work also constitutes a major advance in computational efficacy of accurate, biophysics-based signal predictions from large-scale spike and rate-based neuron network models drastically reducing signal prediction times compared to biophysically detailed network models. This work also provides insight into how experimentally recorded low-frequency extracellular signals of neuronal activity may be approximately linearly dependent on spiking activity. A new software tool LFPykernels serves as a reference implementation of the framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The changing influence of host genetics on the leaf fungal microbiome throughout plant development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Talia L. Karasov, Derek S. Lundberg</p>

Host genetics and the environment influence which fungal microbes colonize a plant. A new study in PLOS Biology finds that the relative influence of these factors changes throughout the development of the biofuel crop switchgrass growing in field settings.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐Duration Progressive Supranuclear Palsy: Clinical Course and Pathological Underpinnings</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration; to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy with ≥10 years and shorter survival times.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 45 cases (24.2%) had a disease duration of ≥10 years. The absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first 3 years from disease onset was the only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, whereas the tufted astrocytes displayed anatomically an opposite severity pattern. Most interestingly, we found significantly less coiled bodies in those who survive longer, in contrast to patients with less favorable course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A considerable proportion of patients had a more ”benign” disease course with ≥10 years survival. They had a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with short survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications of these cell types in trans-cellular propagation. The tempo of disease progression appeared to be determined mostly by oligodendroglial tau, where the high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology might affect neuronal integrity and function on top of neuronal tau pathology. The relative contribution of glial tau should be further explored in cellular and animal models. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning to predict target location with turbulent odor plumes</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior and neural recordings show that the brain is able to measure both the intensity and the timing of odor encounters. However, whether intensity or timing of odor detections is more informative for olfactory-driven behavior is not understood. To tackle this question, we consider the problem of locating a target using the odor it releases. We ask whether the position of a target is best predicted by measures of timing <i>vs</i> intensity of its odor, sampled for a short period of time. To answer this question, we feed data from accurate numerical simulations of odor transport to machine learning algorithms that learn how to connect odor to target location. We find that both intensity and timing can separately predict target location even from a distance of several meters; however, their efficacy varies with the dilution of the odor in space. Thus, organisms that use olfaction from different ranges may have to switch among different modalities. This has implications on how the brain should represent odors as the target is approached. We demonstrate simple strategies to improve accuracy and robustness of the prediction by modifying odor sampling and appropriately combining distinct measures together. To test the predictions, animal behavior and odor representation should be monitored as the animal moves relative to the target, or in virtual conditions that mimic concentrated <i>vs</i> dilute environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-step recognition of potential 5' splice sites by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae U1 snRNP</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, splice sites define the introns of pre-mRNAs and must be recognized and excised with nucleotide precision by the spliceosome to make the correct mRNA product. In one of the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognizes the 5' splice site (5' SS) through a combination of base pairing, protein-RNA contacts, and interactions with other splicing factors. Previous studies investigating the mechanisms of 5' SS recognition have largely been done <i>in vivo</i> or in cellular extracts where the U1/5' SS interaction is difficult to deconvolute from the effects of <i>trans</i>-acting factors or RNA structure. In this work we used co-localization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to elucidate the pathway of 5' SS selection by purified yeast U1 snRNP. We determined that U1 reversibly selects 5' SS in a sequence-dependent, two-step mechanism. A kinetic selection scheme enforces pairing at particular positions rather than overall duplex stability to achieve long-lived U1 binding. Our results provide a kinetic basis for how U1 may rapidly surveil nascent transcripts for 5' SS and preferentially accumulate at these sequences rather than on close cognates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation of functional hepatocytes by forward programming with nuclear receptors</a></h4>

              
                Production of large quantities of hepatocytes remains a major challenge for a number of clinical applications in the biomedical field. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) provides an advantageous solution and a number of protocols have been developed for this purpose. However, these methods usually follow different steps of liver development in vitro, which is time consuming and requires complex culture conditions. In addition, HLCs lack the full repertoire of functionalities characterising primary hepatocytes. Here, we explore the interest of forward programming to generate hepatocytes from hPSCs and to bypass these limitations. This approach relies on the overexpression of three hepatocyte nuclear factors (<i>HNF1A</i>, <i>HNF6,</i> and <i>FOXA3</i>) in combination with different nuclear receptors expressed in the adult liver using the OPTi-OX platform. Forward programming allows for the rapid production of hepatocytes (FoP-Heps) with functional characteristics using a simplified process. We also uncovered that the overexpression of nuclear receptors such as RORc can enhance specific functionalities of FoP-Heps thereby validating its role in lipid/glucose metabolism. Together, our results show that forward programming could offer a versatile alternative to direct differentiation for generating hepatocytes in vitro.

                The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing, but its targeting scope is limited by the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). To expand the target scope, it is crucial to develop a CRISPR toolbox capable of recognizing multiple PAMs. Here, using a GFP-activation assay, we tested the activities of 29 type II-C orthologs closely related to Nme1Cas9, 25 of which are active in human cells. These orthologs recognize diverse PAMs with variable length and nucleotide preference, including purine-rich, pyrimidine-rich, and mixed purine and pyrimidine PAMs. We characterized in depth the activity and specificity of Nsp2Cas9. We also generated a chimeric Cas9 nuclease that recognizes a simple N<sub>4</sub>C PAM, representing the most relaxed PAM preference for compact Cas9s to date. These Cas9 nucleases significantly enhance our ability to perform allele-specific genome editing.

                The maintenance of items in working memory (WM) relies on a widespread network of cortical areas and hippocampus where synchronization between electrophysiological recordings reflects functional coupling. We investigated the direction of information flow between auditory cortex and hippocampus while participants heard and then mentally replayed strings of letters in WM by activating their phonological loop. We recorded local field potentials from the hippocampus, reconstructed beamforming sources of scalp EEG<i>,</i> and – additionally in four participants – recorded from subdural cortical electrodes. When analyzing Granger causality, the information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a peak in the [4 8] Hz range while participants heard the letters. This flow was subsequently reversed during maintenance while participants maintained the letters in memory. The functional interaction between hippocampus and the cortex and the reversal of information flow provide a physiological basis for the encoding of memory items and their active replay during maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STAG2 promotes the myelination transcriptional programin oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin folds chromosomes via DNA loop extrusion. Cohesin-mediated chromosome loops regulate transcription by shaping long-range enhancer-promoter interactions, among other mechanisms. Mutations of cohesin subunits and regulators cause human developmental diseases termed cohesinopathy. Vertebrate cohesin consists of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2. To probe the physiological functions of cohesin, we created conditional knockout (cKO) mice with <i>Stag2</i> deleted in the nervous system. <i>Stag2</i> cKO mice exhibit growth retardation, neurological defects, and premature death, in part due to insufficient myelination of nerve fibers. <i>Stag2</i> cKO oligodendrocytes exhibit delayed maturation and downregulation of myelination-related genes. <i>Stag2</i> loss reduces promoter-anchored loops at downregulated genes in oligodendrocytes. Thus, STAG2-cohesin generates promoter-anchored loops at myelination-promoting genes to facilitate their transcription. Our study implicates defective myelination as a contributing factor to cohesinopathy and establishes oligodendrocytes as a relevant cell type to explore the mechanisms by which cohesin regulates transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammatory stress signaling via NF-kB alters accessible cholesterol to upregulate SREBP2 transcriptional activity in endothelial cells</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing appreciation that a tight relationship exists between cholesterol homeostasis and immunity in leukocytes, however, this relationship has not been deeply explored in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells (ECs) rapidly respond to extrinsic signals, such as tissue damage or microbial infection, by upregulating factors to activate and recruit circulating leukocytes to the site of injury and aberrant activation of ECs leads to inflammatory based diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol and a key transcription regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, SREBP2, in the EC responses to inflammatory stress. Treatment of primary human ECs with pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SREBP2 cleavage and cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression within the late phase of the acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, SREBP2 activation was dependent on NF-kB DNA binding and canonical SCAP-SREBP2 processing. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of SREBP was mediated by a reduction in accessible cholesterol, leading to heightened sterol sensing and downstream SREBP2 cleavage. Detailed analysis of NF-kB inducible genes that may impact sterol sensing resulted in the identification of a novel <i>RELA</i>-inducible target, <i>STARD10</i>, that mediates accessible cholesterol homeostasis in ECs. Thus, this study provides an in-depth characterization of the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and the acute inflammatory response in EC.

                Amygdala circuitry encodes associations between conditioned stimuli and aversive unconditioned stimuli, and also controls fear expression (Pape and Pare, 2010). However, whether and how irrelevant information for unpaired conditioned stimuli (CS-) is discretely processed, and how it was influenced by stress remain unknown. CS- memory is retrievable immediately after fear conditioning, but then becomes silent after memory consolidation in mice. Synaptic pathway from the lateral to the anterior basal amygdala gates the expression of CS- memory, depending upon Npas4-mediated Drd4 synthesis. The upregulation of Npas4-Drd4 axis, which is precluded by corticosterone, shifts functional states of neural engrams for CS- memory toward silent states and limits its retrievability. In here, we demonstrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the functional states of neural engrams, which can be switched or maintained, supporting discriminative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic demands of the posteromedial default mode network are shaped by dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks</a></h4>

              
                Although BOLD signal decreases in the default mode network (DMN) are commonly observed during attention-demanding tasks, their neurobiological underpinnings are not fully understood. Previous work has shown decreases but also increases in glucose metabolism that match with or dissociate from these BOLD signal decreases, respectively. To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed functional PET/MRI data from 50 healthy subjects during the performance of the visuo-spatial processing game Tetris(R) and combined this with previously published data sets of working memory as well as visual and motor stimulation. Our findings show that the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN is dependent on the metabolic demands of the correspondingly engaged task-positive brain networks. Specifically, the dorsal attention (involved in Tetris(R)) and frontoparietal networks (engaged during working memory) shape the glucose metabolism of the posteromedial DMN in opposing directions. External attention-demanding tasks lead to a downregulation of the posteromedial DMN with consistent decreases in the BOLD signal and glucose metabolism, whereas working memory is subject to metabolically expensive mechanisms of BOLD signal suppression. We suggest that the former finding is mediated by decreased glutamate signaling, while the latter results from active GABAergic inhibition, regulating the competition between self-generated and task-driven internal demands. The results demonstrate that the DMN relates to cognitive processing in a flexible manner and does not always act as a cohesive task-negative network in isolation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Within Cells: Temporal Resolution in Cytoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Membrane</a></h4>

              
                Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder (MDD). The therapeutic mechanisms that take place before, during, or after SSRIs bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) are poorly understood, partially because no studies exist of the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of SSRIs in living cells. We studied escitalopram and fluoxetine using new intensity- based drug-sensing fluorescent reporters ("iDrugSnFRs") targeted to the plasma membrane (PM), cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured neurons and mammalian cell lines. We also employed chemical detection of drug within cells and phospholipid membranes. The drugs attain equilibrium in neuronal cytoplasm and ER, at approximately the same concentration as the externally applied solution, with time constants of a few s (escitalopram) or 200-300 s (fluoxetine). Simultaneously, the drugs accumulate within lipid membranes by [&ge;] 18-fold (escitalopram) or 180-fold (fluoxetine), and possibly by much larger factors. Both drugs leave cytoplasm, lumen, and membranes just as quickly during washout. We synthesized membrane-impermeant quaternary amine derivatives of the two SSRIs. The quaternary derivatives are substantially excluded from membrane, cytoplasm, and ER for > 2.4 h. They inhibit SERT transport-associated currents 6- or 11-fold less potently than the SSRIs (escitalopram or fluoxetine derivative, respectively), providing useful probes for distinguishing compartmentalized SSRI effects. Although our measurements are orders of magnitude faster than the "therapeutic lag" of SSRIs, these data suggest that SSRI-SERT interactions within organelles or membranes may play roles during either the therapeutic effects or the "antidepressant discontinuation syndrome".

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors stabilize mood in several disorders. In general, these drugs bind to the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter (SERT), which clears serotonin from CNS and peripheral tissues. SERT ligands are effective and relatively safe; primary care practitioners often prescribe them. However, they have several side effects and require 2 to 6 weeks of continuous administration until they act effectively. How they work remains perplexing, contrasting with earlier assumptions that the therapeutic mechanism involves SERT inhibition followed by increased extracellular serotonin levels. This study establishes that two SERT ligands, fluoxetine and escitalopram, enter neurons within minutes, while simultaneously accumulating in many membranes. Such knowledge will motivate future research, hopefully revealing where and how SERT ligands "engage" their therapeutic target(s).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network is selective and distinct from other cognition in both function and connectivity in early childhood</a></h4>

              
                Is language distinct from other cognition? Does the neural machinery for language emerge from general-purpose neural mechanisms early in development, becoming tuned for language only after years of experience and maturation? In adults, language is supported by a frontotemporal network that is functionally and connectionally dissociated from adjacent domain-general cortex supporting other, more general cognitive functions. We scanned young children (2-9 years of age) on an auditory language localizer, spatial working memory localizer (engaging the domain-general multiple demand (MD) network), and a resting state scan. Subject-specific functional regions of interest (fROIs) defined with the language task showed consistent selectivity to auditory sentences in key left hemisphere regions, and were not engaged for spatial working memory, showing similar domain-specificity as reported in adults; and despite known prolonged development of frontal cortices, the left inferior frontal cortex ("Brocas area") showed some of the most robust specificity for linguistic content. Thus, despite immature language skills, young children already have left-lateralized brain regions dedicated to linguistic content. Children also showed higher within-network (language-language) connectivity than between-network connectivity (language-to-MD fROIs defined with the working memory task), in both hemispheres, but with higher within-network connectivity on the left. Language-selectivity increased with age (replicated in a subset of children scanned longitudinally) while specificity of language connectivity did not change with age (again replicated longitudinally), suggesting that connectivity is more static than, and may perhaps earmark, functional specificity. By age 2, the language network is specialized for linguistic processing (domain-specific) function, is distinct from adjacent cortex, and is not engaged in other higher-order cognitive processing.

	<p>Objective: We explored a novel model based on deep learning radiomics (DLR) to differentiate Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal control (NC) subjects. This model was validated in an exploratory study using tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) scans. Methods: In this study, we selected tau-PET scans from the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI), which included a total of 211 NC, 197 MCI, and 117 AD subjects. The dataset was divided into one training/validation group and one separate external group for testing. The proposed DLR model contained the following three steps: (1) pre-training of candidate deep learning models; (2) extraction and selection of DLR features; (3) classification based on support vector machine (SVM). In the comparative experiments, we compared the DLR model with three traditional models, including the SUVR model, traditional radiomics model, and a clinical model. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out 200 times in the experiments. Results: Compared with other models, the DLR model achieved the best classification performance, with an accuracy of 90.76% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.15% in NC vs. MCI, 88.43% &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.32% in MCI vs. AD, and 99.92% &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.51% in NC vs. AD. Conclusions: Our proposed DLR model had the potential clinical value to discriminate AD, MCI and NC.</p>

	<p>EEG-based human identification has gained a wide range of attention due to the further increase in demand for security. How to improve the accuracy of the human identification system is an issue worthy of attention. Using more features in the human identification system is a potential solution. However, too many features may cause overfitting, resulting in the decline of system accuracy. In this work, the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was adopted for classification. Multiple features were combined and utilized as the structure matrix of the GCN. Because of the constant signal matrix, the training parameters would not increase as the structure matrix grows. We evaluated the classification accuracy on a classic public dataset. The results showed that utilizing multiple features of functional connectivity (FC) can improve the accuracy of the identity authentication system, the best results of which are at 98.56%. In addition, our methods showed less sensitivity to channel reduction. The method proposed in this paper combines different FCs and reaches high classification accuracy for unpreprocessed data, which inspires reducing the system cost in the actual human identification system.</p>

	<p>Exercise modes can be categorized based on the skills required (open vs. closed skills), which implicates various demands on cognitive skills, especially executive functions (EFs). Thus, their practice may have varying effects on EFs. There is a lack of detailed analysis of cognitive requirements and suitable classification of sports. It is hypothesized that the amount and type of cognitive requirements of sports lead to small effect sizes when comparing open-skill exercising (OSE) and closed-skill exercising (CSE) athletes. The current meta-analysis evaluates the variances in EFs skills caused by particular sport modes. Four research databases (Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO) were searched for cross-sectional studies in which the authors compare the performance in EF tasks of OSE and CSE athletes. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using funnel plots and two reviewer selection process (overall and subgroup analysis; low risk of publication and selection bias). A total of 19 studies were included, revealing an overall effect size of Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.174 (p = 0.157), favoring OSE for the development of EFs. The subgroup analysis revealed the effects for the subdomains of EFs (cognitive flexibility: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.210 &amp;amp;gt; inhibitory control: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.191 &amp;amp;gt; working memory: Hedge&amp;amp;rsquo;s g = 0.138; p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), which could be characterized as low to moderate. The hypothesis that studies with the smallest effect sizes compare sport modes with similar cognitive demands was rejected. The paper discusses the differentiation of sports into OSE and CSE and presents new approaches for their categorization.</p>

	<p>Background: (1) Sleep disorders are prevalent in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and predict cardiac events and prognosis. While increased oxidative stress (OS) has been associated with sleep disorders, less is known about its relationship with sleep quality. Similarly, little is known of how this relationship might change with exercise, which can improve sleep quality. Factors of sleep quality, such as sleep duration and disturbances, are also important as they predict cardiovascular diseases better than a global score alone. This study investigated whether OS was associated with self-rated sleep quality and its factors before and after completing a 24-week exercise intervention. (2) Methods: CAD patients undergoing an exercise program were recruited. OS was measured at baseline by the concentrations of early- (lipid hydroperoxides, LPH) and late-stage (8-isoprostane, 8-ISO) lipid peroxidation products and their ratio. Sleep quality was measured by the self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument at baseline and termination. Three sleep factors - perceived sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and daily disturbances - were derived from the PSQI. (3) Results: Among CAD patients (n = 113, 85.0% male, age = 63.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.4 years, global PSQI = 5.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.0), those with poor sleep (PSQI &amp;amp;ge; 5) had higher baseline 8-ISO levels (F(1,111) = 6.212, p = 0.014, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.053) compared to those with normal sleep. Concentrations of LPH (F(1,105) = 0.569, p = 0.453, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.005) and 8-ISO/LPH ratios (F(1,105) = 2.173, p = 0.143, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.020) did not differ between those with poor sleep and normal sleep. Among factors, perceived sleep quality was associated with 8-ISO and 8-ISO/LPH, and daily disturbances were associated with 8-ISO. (4) Conclusions: A marker of late-stage lipid peroxidation is elevated in CAD patients with poor sleep and associated with daily disturbances, but not with other factors or with sleep quality and its factors after exercise intervention.</p>

	<p>This study analyzes the profile of executive functions (EF) in high-functioning adults with autism (HFA), both in terms of performance on four computer-based tasks, as well as how these functions are perceived by the individuals through self-reporting measures. The study included 64 participants: 32 individuals with HFA, and 32 typically developing controls. Four CANTAB tasks were used (assessing spatial working memory, planning, visual memory, and inhibition), as well as a self-reported measure of executive functions (BDEFS) and a scale for the severity of autism symptoms (RAADS-R). The participants in the ASD group performed significantly lower than the control group on all four computer-based tasks, as measured by the total number of errors made (for the spatial working memory, visual memory, and inhibition tasks) and the number of problems solved at the first choice (for the planning task). No correlation was found in the ASD group between the severity of autism symptoms and the computer-based measures. These findings provide evidence that HFA adults may have various executive functioning impairments, and subsequent daily life problems, but these deficits do not necessarily correlate with the severity of core ASD symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Novel Axon Regeneration Role for Noncanonical Wnt Signaling in the Adult Retina after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways are essential for development and maintenance of the CNS. Whereas the roles of canonical Wnt pathways in neuronal survival and axonal regeneration in adult CNS have been described, the functions of noncanonical Wnt pathways are not well understood. Furthermore, the role of noncanonical Wnt ligands in the adult retina has not been investigated. Noncanonical Wnt signaling shares receptors with canonical Wnt ligands but functions through calcium and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Noncanonical ligands, such as the prototypic ligand Wnt5a, have varying effects in the developing CNS, including inhibiting or promoting axonal growth. To identify a role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in the developed retina after injury, we characterized the effect of Wnt5a on neurite outgrowth in cultured retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and on axonal regeneration in the injured optic nerve in the mouse. Endogenous Wnt5a was upregulated after injury and exogenous Wnt5a significantly enhanced neurite growth of primary RGCs and led to extensive axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Wnt5a also significantly increased RGC survival. Furthermore, Wnt5a induced phosphorylation of CamKII and JNK and induced expression of their downstream pathway components. Therefore, these results demonstrate for the first time that Wnt5a promotes axonal growth and protects RGCs in the adult retina.</p>

                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac events rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep learning prediction of chemical-induced dose-dependent and context-specific multiplex phenotype responses and its application to personalized alzheimer’s disease drug repurposing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by You Wu, Qiao Liu, Yue Qiu, Lei Xie</p>

Predictive modeling of drug-induced gene expressions is a powerful tool for phenotype-based compound screening and drug repurposing. State-of-the-art machine learning methods use a small number of fixed cell lines as a surrogate for predicting actual expressions in a new cell type or tissue, although it is well known that drug responses depend on a cellular context. Thus, the existing approach has limitations when applied to personalized medicine, especially for many understudied diseases whose molecular profiles are dramatically different from those characterized in the training data. Besides the gene expression, dose-dependent cell viability is another important phenotype readout and is more informative than conventional summary statistics (e.g., IC50) for characterizing clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. However, few computational methods can reliably predict the dose-dependent cell viability. To address the challenges mentioned above, we designed a new deep learning model, MultiDCP, to predict cellular context-dependent gene expressions and cell viability on a specific dosage. The novelties of MultiDCP include a knowledge-driven gene expression profile transformer that enables context-specific phenotypic response predictions of novel cells or tissues, integration of multiple diverse labeled and unlabeled omics data, the joint training of the multiple prediction tasks, and a teacher-student training procedure that allows us to utilize unreliable data effectively. Comprehensive benchmark studies suggest that MultiDCP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with unseen cell lines that are dissimilar from the cell lines in the supervised training in terms of gene expressions. The predicted drug-induced gene expressions demonstrate a stronger predictive power than noisy experimental data for downstream tasks. Thus, MultiDCP is a useful tool for transcriptomics-based drug repurposing and compound screening that currently rely on noisy high-throughput experimental data. We applied MultiDCP to repurpose individualized drugs for Alzheimer’s disease in terms of efficacy and toxicity, suggesting that MultiDCP is a potentially powerful tool for personalized drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nine quick tips for pathway enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Agapito</p>

Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven modelling captures dynamics of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amit Singh, Congxin Li, Axel C. R. Diernfellner, Thomas Höfer, Michael Brunner</p>

Eukaryotic circadian clocks are based on self-sustaining, cell-autonomous oscillatory feedback loops that can synchronize with the environment via recurrent stimuli (zeitgebers) such as light. The components of biological clocks and their network interactions are becoming increasingly known, calling for a quantitative understanding of their role for clock function. However, the development of data-driven mathematical clock models has remained limited by the lack of sufficiently accurate data. Here we present a comprehensive model of the circadian clock of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> that describe free-running oscillations in constant darkness and entrainment in light-dark cycles. To parameterize the model, we measured high-resolution time courses of luciferase reporters of morning and evening specific clock genes in WT and a mutant strain. Fitting the model to such comprehensive data allowed estimating parameters governing circadian phase, period length and amplitude, and the response of genes to light cues. Our model suggests that functional maturation of the core clock protein Frequency causes a delay in negative feedback that is critical for generating circadian rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatiotemporal spread of Plasmodium falciparum mutations for resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine across Africa, 1990–2020</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer A. Flegg, Georgina S. Humphreys, Brenda Montanez, Taryn Strickland, Zaira J. Jacome-Meza, Karen I. Barnes, Jaishree Raman, Philippe J. Guerin, Carol Hopkins Sibley, Sabina Dahlström Otienoburu</p>
Background <p>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended in Africa in several antimalarial preventive regimens including Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnant women (IPTp), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) and Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC). The effectiveness of SP-based preventive treatments are threatened in areas where <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> resistance to SP is high. The prevalence of mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase gene (<i>pfdhps</i>) can be used to monitor SP effectiveness. IPTi-SP is recommended only in areas where the prevalence of the <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation is below 50%. It has also been suggested that IPTp-SP does not have a protective effect in areas where the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation, exceeds 10%. However, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data in Africa are extremely heterogenous and scattered, with data completely missing from many areas.</p> Methods and findings <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database was designed to summarize dihydrofolate reductase (<i>pfdhfr)</i> and <i>pfdhps</i> gene mutation prevalence data. In this paper, <i>pfdhps</i> mutation prevalence data was used to generate continuous spatiotemporal surface maps of the estimated prevalence of the SP resistance markers <i>pfdhps</i>437G, <i>pfdhps</i>540E, and <i>pfdhps</i>581G in Africa from 1990 to 2020 using a geostatistical model, with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate uncertainty. The maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the <i>pfdhps</i>437G mutations across the entire continent over the last three decades. The <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation emerged from limited foci in East Africa to currently exceeding 50% estimated prevalence in most of East and South East Africa. <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding at low or moderate prevalence in central Africa and a predicted focus in West Africa. Although the <i>pfdhps</i>581G mutation spread from one focus in East Africa in 2000, to exceeding 10% estimated prevalence in several foci in 2010, the predicted distribution of the marker did not expand in 2020, however our analysis indicated high uncertainty in areas where <i>pfdhps</i>581G is present. Uncertainty was higher in spatial regions where the prevalence of a marker is intermediate or where prevalence is changing over time.</p> Conclusions <p>The WWARN SP Molecular Surveyor database and a set of continuous spatiotemporal surface maps were built to provide users with standardized, current information on resistance marker distribution and prevalence estimates. According to the maps, the high prevalence of <i>pfdhps</i>540E mutation was to date restricted to East and South East Africa, which is reassuring for continued use of IPTi and SMC in West Africa, but continuous monitoring is needed as the <i>pfdhps</i>540E distribution is expanding. Several foci where <i>pfdhps</i>581G prevalence exceeded 10% were identified. More data on the <i>pfdhps</i>581G distribution in these areas needs to be collected to guide IPTp-SP recommendations. Prevalence and uncertainty maps can be utilized together to strategically identify sites where increased surveillance can be most informative. This study combines a molecular marker database and predictive modelling to highlight areas of concern, which can be used to support decisions in public health, highlight knowledge gaps in certain regions, and guide future research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Scelestial: Fast and accurate single-cell lineage tree inference based on a Steiner tree approximation algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad-Hadi Foroughmand-Araabi, Sama Goliaei, Alice C. McHardy</p>

Single-cell genome sequencing provides a highly granular view of biological systems but is affected by high error rates, allelic amplification bias, and uneven genome coverage. This creates a need for data-specific computational methods, for purposes such as for cell lineage tree inference. The objective of cell lineage tree reconstruction is to infer the evolutionary process that generated a set of observed cell genomes. Lineage trees may enable a better understanding of tumor formation and growth, as well as of organ development for healthy body cells. We describe a method, Scelestial, for lineage tree reconstruction from single-cell data, which is based on an approximation algorithm for the Steiner tree problem and is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method. We adapt the algorithm to efficiently select a limited subset of potential sequences as internal nodes, in the presence of missing values, and to minimize cost by lineage tree-based missing value imputation. In a comparison against seven state-of-the-art single-cell lineage tree reconstruction algorithms—BitPhylogeny, OncoNEM, SCITE, SiFit, SASC, SCIPhI, and SiCloneFit—on simulated and real single-cell tumor samples, Scelestial performed best at reconstructing trees in terms of accuracy and run time. Scelestial has been implemented in C++. It is also available as an R package named RScelestial.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host genotype controls ecological change in the leaf fungal microbiome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Acer VanWallendael, Gian Maria Niccolo Benucci, Pedro Beschoren da Costa, Linnea Fraser, Avinash Sreedasyam, Felix Fritschi, Thomas E. Juenger, John T. Lovell, Gregory Bonito, David B. Lowry</p>

Leaf fungal microbiomes can be fundamental drivers of host plant success, as they contain pathogens that devastate crop plants and taxa that enhance nutrient uptake, discourage herbivory, and antagonize pathogens. We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.
