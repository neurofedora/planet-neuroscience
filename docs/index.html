              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-56/v1?src=rss">The Effect of Corporate Governance and Transformational Leadership on Business Strategy and Business Performance Moderated by Government Policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The performance of regional-owned multi-business enterprises (BUMD Aneka Usaha) in Indonesia is crucial for regional economic development, yet many still face challenges related to weak corporate governance, leadership, and business strategy. Methods Data were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 176 directors of regional-owned multi-business enterprises across Indonesia. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), with higher-order constructs estimated in SmartPLS. Results The findings show that corporate governance, transformational leadership, and business strategy each have positive and significant effects on business performance, and that business strategy mediates the effects of governance and leadership on performance. Government policy also significantly moderates the relationships between corporate governance, transformational leadership, business strategy, and business performance, strengthening their positive impact. Conclusions These results highlight the need to reinforce internal capabilities through stronger governance practices, transformational leadership, and flexible, innovation-oriented strategies, while ensuring a supportive government policy environment so that regional-owned enterprises can improve their sustainable performance and public value creation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-55/v1?src=rss">Enhancing Quality Assurance Monitoring and Evaluation and the Promotion of Competence-Based Education in Uganda: A Case of Kampala International University [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Competence-Based Education (CBE) has become a central reform in higher education, emphasizing mastery of practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge. Kampala International University (KIU) recognizes the importance of aligning its programs with labour market expectations. However, challenges remain in staff understanding, curriculum adaptation, and identification of essential competencies. Quality assurance monitoring and evaluation frameworks are critical in guiding institutions through this transition. Methods The study adopted a cross-sectional design and employed a concurrent mixed-methods approach. A sample of 357 participants was drawn from a population of 5,400, including 328 students, 28 lecturers, and the Director of Quality Assurance. Data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis. Results The findings revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between institutional quality assurance monitoring and evaluation and the promotion of CBE. Student responses showed a weak but significant correlation (r (304) = 0.17, p = 0.003), whereas lecturer responses showed a moderate correlation (r (23) = 0.62, p = 0.001). Lecturers perceived their institution as having a well-defined monitoring and evaluation framework, which influenced their professional conduct more strongly than students’ daily learning experiences. Conclusion The study concludes that robust quality assurance mechanisms are essential for advancing CBE implementation. Effective governance structures, organized data management, continuous staff training, and stakeholder participation strengthen institutional readiness and compliance with national standards. These mechanisms ensure that CBE reforms at KIU contribute to sustainable educational transformation and improved workforce preparedness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-54/v1?src=rss">Anger, Aggression and Hostility Assessment Among Medical Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Anger, aggression, and hostility are interconnected and are difficult to evaluate. Aggression, in particular, may be a negative behavior and should be minimized. This study aimed to obtain the perceptions of anger, hostility, and aggression among medical students by comparing self-rating detailed assessment tool scores with students’ self, social and academic factors. Methods This cross-sectional study measured the anger, aggression, and hostility of medical students using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AGQ). AGQ scores were compared with age, body mass index (BMI), sex, physical activity, academic level, college grade point average (GPA), study duration, gaming, and social media time using t-test, ANOVA, and Spearman’s correlation. Results A total of 138 medical students were included in this study: 109 males (79.0%) and 29 females (21.0%), with ages ranging from 18 to 27 years. The median Total AGQ was 71.5 with an IQR of 43.3. Insignificant results were found comparing total aggression scores (AGQ) with sex or educational levels, with p-value of 0.93 and 0.243, respectively, with the exception of hostility scores (AGQ_Host), which showed a significant association with educational level, with a p-value of 0.023. A significant inverse association was found between physical activity level and both the AGQ and AGQ-Host, with p-values of 0.047 and 0.002, respectively. Finally, GPA had a significant positive correlation with the AGQ-Host, with a p-value of 0.021. Conclusion Physical activity level, educational levels, and GPA were found to be the most influential factors in affecting the AGQ scores among other factors in this study. The use of better coping mechanisms, encouraging physical activity, improving sleep quality, and maintaining proper studying techniques may help reduce the AGQ scores.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-53/v1?src=rss">MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized morphology, generating massive 3D datasets such as microCT scans. While open-source platforms like 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph have democratized access to advanced visualization and analysis software, a significant “compute gap” persists. Processing high-resolution 3D data requires high-end GPUs and substantial RAM, resources that are frequently unavailable at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and other educational settings. This “digital divide” prevents many researchers and students from utilizing the very data and software that have been made open to them. Methods We present MorphoCloud, a platform designed to bridge this hardware barrier by providing on-demand, research-grade computing environments via a web browser. MorphoCloud utilizes an “IssuesOps” architecture, where users manage their remote workstations entirely through GitHub Issues using natural-language commands (e.g., /create, /unshelve). The technology stack leverages GitHub Issues and Actions for front-end and orchestration respectively, JetStream2 for backend compute, and Apache Guacamole to deliver a high-performance, GPU-accelerated desktop experience to any modern browser. Results The platform enables a streamlined lifecycle for remote instances, which come pre-configured with the SlicerMorph ecosystem, R/RStudio, and AI-assisted segmentation tools like NNInteractive and MEMOs. Users have access to a persistent storage volume that is decoupled from the instance. For educational purposes, MorphoCloud supports “Workshop” instances that allow for bulk provisioning and stay online continuously for short-term events. This identical environment ensures that instructors can conduct complex 3D workflows without the typical troubleshooting delays caused by heterogeneous student hardware. Conclusion MorphoCloud demonstrates that true scientific accessibility requires not just open data and software, but also open infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of cloud administration into a simple, command-driven interface, MorphoCloud empowers researchers at under-resourced institutions to engage in high-performance morphological analysis and AI-assisted segmentation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08056">The embodied brain: Bridging the brain, body, and behavior with neuromechanical digital twins</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal behavior reflects interactions between the nervous system, body, and environment. Therefore, biomechanics and environmental context must be considered to dissect algorithms for behavioral control. This is enabled by leveraging neuromechanical digital twins: computational models that embed artificial neural controllers within realistic body models in simulated environments. Here we review advances in the creation and use of neuromechanical digital twins while also highlighting emerging opportunities for the future. First, we illustrate how neuromechanical models allow researchers to infer hidden biophysical variables that may be difficult to measure experimentally. Additionally, by perturbing these models, one can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses. Next, we explore how neuromechanical twins have been used to foster a deeper exchange between neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Finally, we show how neuromechanical twins can advance healthcare. We envision that coupling studies on animals with active probing of their neuromechanical twins will greatly accelerate neuroscientific discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08285">Training Under Attentional Competition Produces Persistent Biases in Visual Appearance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective attention can momentarily alter visual appearance, but can such effects be learned? We tested whether training attention under sensory competition produces lasting changes in perceived contrast. Across seven days, participants trained on an orientation task with a fixed target location, with or without a salient distractor. Before and after training, we measured the point of subjective equality (PSE). Training under competition produced a reliable push-pull shift. Stimuli at the trained location appeared higher in contrast, whereas stimuli at the untrained location appeared lower. Conversely, training without distractors improved performance but did not alter appearance. Crucially, these opponent shifts were robust to task variations, persisting even in equality judgments designed to minimize response bias. Furthermore, the effect generalized to stimuli with novel orientation and contrast levels. These findings demonstrate that resolving sensory competition does not merely improve discrimination, but durably recalibrates the subjective appearance of the visual world.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08818">Gyral-Sulcal-Net: An Integrated Network Representation of Brain Folding Patterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)

                arXiv:2601.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the "two-hit vascular hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08685">Stable Filtering for Efficient Dimensionality Reduction of Streaming Manifold Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.

Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a 6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway to account the conceptualized roles of self-control on procrastination, and potentially offers a validated, theory-driven strategy for interventions.

                arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

                arXiv:2510.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals into physiological activity, pathological (epileptic) activity, power-line noise, and other non-cerebral artifacts. Traditional methods for iEEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of iEEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,231 samples using a 70/20/10 split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous non-specialized CNN- and LSTM-based approaches and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model achieves high discrimination of noise and artifact classes, with precisions of 0.98 and approximately 1, respectively. Classification between physiological and pathological signals exhibits a modest but clinically interpretable overlap, with F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.90 and 175 and 272 cross-class false positives, respectively, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well-suited for iEEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling the capture of both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The study also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning, the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, and normalization steps that support high model performance. While the results demonstrate strong in-distribution performance, generalizability across datasets and clinical settings has yet to be established.

                arXiv:2601.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) provides a biologically-plausible learning mechanism for spiking neural networks (SNNs); however, Hebbian weight updates in architectures with recurrent connections suffer from pathological weight dynamics: unbounded growth, catastrophic forgetting, and loss of representational diversity. We propose a neuromorphic regularization scheme inspired by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis: periodic offline phases during which external inputs are suppressed, synaptic weights undergo stochastic decay toward a homeostatic baseline, and spontaneous activity enables memory consolidation. We demonstrate that this sleep-wake cycle prevents weight saturation while preserving learned structure. Empirically, we find that low to intermediate sleep durations (10-20\% of training) improve stability on MNIST-like benchmarks in our STDP-SNN model, without any data-specific hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, the same sleep intervention yields no measurable benefit for the surrogate-gradient spiking neural network (SG-SNN). Taken together, these results suggest that periodic, sleep-based renormalization may represent a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing local Hebbian learning in neuromorphic systems, while also indicating that special care is required when integrating such protocols with existing gradient-based optimization methods.

                arXiv:2601.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) provides a biologically grounded learning rule for spiking neural networks (SNNs), but its reliance on precise spike timing and pairwise updates limits fast learning of weights. We introduce a supervised extension of Spike Agreement-Dependent Plasticity (SADP), which replaces pairwise spike-timing comparisons with population-level agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The proposed learning rule preserves strict synaptic locality, admits linear-time complexity, and enables efficient supervised learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing.
  We integrate supervised SADP within hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders provide compact feature representations that are converted into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning in the SNN. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical image classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance and fast convergence. Additional analyses show stable performance across broad hyperparameter ranges and compatibility with device-inspired synaptic update dynamics. Together, these results establish supervised SADP as a scalable, biologically grounded, and hardware-aligned learning paradigm for spiking neural networks.

                arXiv:2601.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving neural network architectures is a computationally demanding process. Traditional methods often require an extensive search through large architectural spaces and offer limited understanding of how structural modifications influence model behavior. This paper introduces \gls{ngspt}, a novel Neuroevolution algorithm based on two key innovations. First, we adapt geometric semantic operators~(GSOs) from genetic programming to neural network evolution, ensuring that architectural changes produce predictable effects on network semantics within a unimodal error surface. Second, we introduce a novel operator (DGSM) that enables controlled reduction of network size, while maintaining the semantic properties of~GSOs. Unlike traditional approaches, \gls{ngspt}'s efficient evaluation mechanism, which only requires computing the semantics of newly added components, allows for efficient population-based training, resulting in a comprehensive exploration of the search space at a fraction of the computational cost. Experimental results on four regression benchmarks show that \gls{ngspt} consistently evolves compact neural networks that achieve performance comparable to or better than established methods in the literature, such as standard neural networks, SLIM-GSGP, TensorNEAT, and SLM.

                arXiv:2601.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has mostly focused on learning policies, typically neural networks, that operate on a single candidate solution at a time, either by constructing one from scratch or iteratively improving it. In contrast, decades of work in metaheuristics have shown that maintaining and evolving populations of solutions improves robustness and exploration, and often leads to stronger performance. To close this gap, we study how to make NCO explicitly population-based by learning policies that act on sets of candidate solutions. We first propose a simple taxonomy of population awareness levels and use it to highlight two key design challenges: (i) how to represent a whole population inside a neural network, and (ii) how to learn population dynamics that balance intensification (generating good solutions) and diversification (maintaining variety). We make these ideas concrete with two complementary tools: one that improves existing solutions using information shared across the whole population, and the other generates new candidate solutions that explicitly balance being high-quality with diversity. Experimental results on Maximum Cut and Maximum Independent Set indicate that incorporating population structure is advantageous for learned optimization methods and opens new connections between NCO and classical population-based search.

Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning systems have centred on developing of specialised hardware for neural networks. These systems typically feature architectures that go beyond the von Neumann model employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs, offering potential efficiency and performance gains. However, neural networks developed for specialised hardware must consider its specific characteristics. This requires novel training algorithms and accurate hardware models, since they cannot be abstracted as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to training neural networks for hardware-based spiking neurons and synapses, built using ferroelectric capacitors (FeCAPs) and resistive random-access memories (RRAMs), respectively. Unlike the common approach of designing hardware to fit abstract neuron or synapse models, we start with compact models of the physical device to model the computational primitives. Based on these models, we have developed a training algorithm (BRUNO) that can reliably train the networks, even when applying hardware limitations, such as stochasticity or low bit precision. We analyse and compare BRUNO with Backpropagation Through Time. We test it on different spatio-temporal datasets. First on a music prediction dataset, where a network composed of ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF) neurons is used to predict at each time step the next musical note that should be played. The second dataset consists on the classification of the Braille letters using a network composed of quantised RRAM synapses and FeLIF neurons. The performance of this network is then compared with that of networks composed of LIF neurons. Experimental results show the potential advantages of using BRUNO by reducing the time and memory required to detect spatio-temporal patterns with quantised synapses.

Abstract: Designing scientific instrumentation often requires exploring large, highly constrained design spaces using computationally expensive physics simulations. These simulators pose substantial challenges for integrating evolutionary computation (EC) into scientific design workflows. Evolutionary computation typically requires numerous design evaluations, making the integration of slow, low-throughput simulators particularly challenging, as they are optimized for accuracy and ease of use rather than throughput. We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges. ECLIPSE enables interdisciplinary teams of physicists, engineers, and EC researchers to collaboratively explore unconventional designs for scientific hardware while leveraging existing domain-specific simulation software.

                arXiv:2601.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.

                Background Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint experienced by pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, which can interfere with daily activities, sleep quality, and readiness for labor. Nonpharmacological approaches such as music therapy and hypnobirthing are developing as alternatives that are considered safe, inexpensive, and minimal in side effects, but the effectiveness of the combination of the two methods has not been widely studied in the context of pregnancy in Indonesia Methods This quasi-experimental study aimed to examine the effectiveness of hypnobirthing, music therapy, and their combination in alleviating LBP among third-trimester pregnant women. A total of 200 participants were divided into four groups: hypnobirthing (n=50), music therapy (n=50), a combination group (n=50), and a control group receiving standard antenatal care (n=50). The study was conducted at four Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) in Palembang City, South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. Pain levels were assessed before and after the intervention using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The statistical analyses used included the Paired Sample t-test, One-Way ANOVA, and Post hoc comparisons using Tukey HSD test for mean pain scores between the groups. Results The study showed a statistically significant reduction in LBP intensity in all the intervention groups compared to that in the control group (p < 0.001), with the combined intervention group demonstrating the greatest improvement. These findings suggest that both hypnobirthing and music therapy are effective in managing pregnancy-related LBP, and their combination may offer enhanced benefits for managing pregnancy-related LBP. Conclusions Music therapy and hypnobirthing have been proven effective in reducing lower back pain intensity in pregnant women in their third trimester, with the combination of both therapies providing the most significant effect. This study supports the inclusion of non-pharmacological approaches in routine antenatal care to improve maternal comfort and well-being.

                Background This study addresses the limited awareness of local history, low sense of patriotism, and weak participation in national activities among elementary school students. These issues are linked to conventional learning methods and the lack of innovative, technology-based media in social studies education. Methods The research aimed to develop an immersive and contextual learning medium using Augmented Reality (AR) to foster students’ nationalism through the local history of the Rawa Gede Monument in Karawang, Indonesia. A Research and Development (R&D) design was applied using the ADDIE model, which includes five stages: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. Participants consisted of 126 fifth-grade students from five public elementary schools in four subdistricts of Karawang Regency. Data were collected through classroom observations, nationalism attitude scales, questionnaires, and interviews with students and teachers. Results The AR-based media, titled Rawa Gede History AR, was developed to integrate local historical content with interactive 3D visualizations. Expert validation indicated that the media was valid, practical, and feasible for classroom use. The implementation phase involved limited and broader field testing to evaluate effectiveness. Statistical analysis of pre-test and post-test results yielded a significance value of 0.001 (p < 0.05), showing a significant improvement in students’ nationalism after using the AR media. Observations and interviews further confirmed increased engagement, enthusiasm, and understanding of local history. Conclusions The findings suggest that integrating AR technology with local historical content enhances learning engagement and contextual understanding while strengthening students’ sense of national identity. Overall, Rawa Gede History AR serves as a validated, effective, and practical innovation for promoting nationalism and meaningful social studies learning in elementary schools.

                The web of power in the struggle for forest resources arose as a response to forest resource conflicts between the state and local communities. In Foucault’s concept, power was not held solely by the state but existed in social relations involving various parties. This study aimed to map the web of power in the struggle for access rights to forest resources. It used a qualitative approach and a comparative case study method. The informants for this study were local governments, forest managers, local communities, and NGOs. Ten informants were selected purposively in each location. Data collection techniques were observation, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. Data analysis was carried out using thematic analysis. The study results showed that in Mount Halimun Salak National Park (TNGHS), conflict occurred due to the policy of expanding the national park, resulting in the loss of local community access to the forest area. Meanwhile, in Sungai Utik, the conflict was triggered by a state policy that issued a business permit to use forest products (IUPHHK) in the customary forest area. Although the IUPHHK has never been revoked, the power relations have shown a more egalitarian pattern based on the state’s recognition and the community’s solidarity. The findings indicated that contestation over access rights to forest resources in two different forests had resulted in two distinct webs of power models. Power relations were not static, but constantly changed depending on the configuration of local communities’ political power, legal support, advocacy networks, and social capital.

                Introductıon The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of apocynin in a selenite-induced cataract model, and to evaluate its impact on cataract severity and antioxidant enzyme activities. Methods Thirty-five rats were randomly separated into five groups (n = 7 per group). The control group received only saline. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were administered sodium selenite at a dose of 30 nmol/g. In addition, Group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Group 3 received 10 mg/kg apocynin, and Group 4 received 20 mg/kg apocynin. The apocynin treatment was administered intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Results Low-dose apocynin was seen to enhance antioxidant defence by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels (p = 0.003, p = 0.002) without altering malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p = 0.04). High-dose apocynin (20 mg/kg) led to an increase in MDA, suggesting a possible dose-related pro-oxidant effect. Conclusion This study suggests that apocynin, particularly at a low dose (10 mg/kg), may prevent selenite-induced cataract formation. Low-dose apocynin effectively delayed cataract progression by enhancing antioxidant defence and limiting oxidative stress. In contrast, high-dose exposure revealed a possible pro-oxidant effect, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization.

                Financial networks, and neural architectures—generate nonstationary, heavy-tailed, and highly irregular time series that are poorly captured by classical statistical summaries. Conventional performance metrics like mean latency and throughput often fail to reveal early-warning signatures of systemic stress or impending failure. There is a growing need for scale-aware analytical tools that can capture hidden structure in consensus dynamics and network perturbations. We develop an end-to-end statistical framework that treats consensus protocols as high-dimensional discrete-time dynamical systems subject to stochastic latency and failure processes. Using a Python-based discrete-event simulator implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, we generate time series of consensus latency, message complexity, and network latency under multiple operational regimes (normal load, high load, denial-of-service–type attacks, and partial node failures). We then apply Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to these time series, deriving generalized Hurst exponents, singularity spectra f(α), and spectrum width Δα as multifractal descriptors. Synthetic results are complemented with an analysis of block chain-style data based on block inter-arrival and propagation times. Across all simulated regimes, consensus latency exhibits nontrivial multifractal structure with finite spectrum width Δα. Stress scenarios driven by heavy-tailed latency and node failures produce substantially broader and more left-skewed spectra than baseline conditions, indicating richer intermittency and clustered extremes. We find a strong positive association between Δα and mean consensus latency, and a moderate association between Δα and failure incidence. Comparative analysis of Raft-like traces and proof-of-work–style traces shows that multifractal spectra retain algorithm-specific signatures while sharing common stress-induced broadening. The findings support the view that multifractal descriptors offer a sensitive, scale-aware complement to traditional performance metrics for distributed consensus systems. Spectrum width Δα acts as a quantitative indicator of systemic complexity and can serve as an early-warning marker for performance degradation and partial instability. The proposed framework bridges chaos theory, multifractal analysis, and consensus protocols and suggests practical pathways for integrating multifractal monitoring into the design, diagnosis, and control of big-data, block chain, and cyber-physical infrastructures.

                Background There is urgent need for comprehensive climate change policies to mitigate impacts and protect the interests of those most vulnerable to its worst effects. The Labour Government has rejected its own 2021 £28bn annual investment in climate change policies on account of commitment to economic restraint and public opinion. Not only does this pose real risks to the UK’s ability to respond to climate change, it may also reduce a range of social and economic benefits. Methods We report findings of innovative mixed-methods survey analysis of public perceptions of an illustrative Green New Deal within three surveys (1) n=693; 2) n=10; 3) n=2,200) of adult UK residents conducted between November 2023-January 2024. Results We analyse the findings of survey 3 to show that levels of support for a Green New Deal are high across parties and demographic groups, and increase further when voters are presented with narrative justifications adversarially co-produced with opponents – termed ‘haters’ – of the policy. We find clear associations between risk of destitution and various other socioeconomic characteristics, health status and levels of support. We present innovative Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) of these associations and find moderately strong positive correlations with levels of support for key infrastructural policies. Conclusions This article presents further evidence in support of the notion that exposure to risk of destitution, which varies by age, is a key determinant of policy preference at a time in which political affiliation is increasingly fluid and the prima facie need for a Green New Deal is considerable. This suggests that, in order to understand preferences and to present responses to challenges, there is good reason to focus on material outcomes. Given the importance of a Green New Deal to enhancing financial security, progressive politicians have every reason to commit to substantive reform.

                Background Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for financial stability, and sector-specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) models have proven superior in performance. However, a significant gap exists, as most models are designed for advanced economies, leaving their efficacy in emerging markets like India unexplored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the applicability of these advanced models to predict bankruptcy within India’s dynamic trade services sector. Methods The research utilized a substantial sample of 5,527 Indian companies. To counter the challenge of having far fewer bankrupt firms than solvent ones, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. The study then leveraged a comprehensive suite of eight popular AI-ML models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, with performance rigorously evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and guard against overfitting. To add practical context, business rules based on key financial metrics—liquidity, profitability, and asset size—were integrated. Results The findings robustly demonstrate that AI-ML models can accurately predict bankruptcy in Indian trade services firms. A critical discovery was the variation in early warning signals between an analysis of the entire dataset (aggregate) and segmented groups of companies. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach obscures important, segment-specific risk factors. The segmented analysis successfully uncovered hidden risks that were not apparent at the aggregate level. Conclusions The study concludes that AI-ML models are highly effective for bankruptcy prediction in India’s trade services sector. For stakeholders like investors and creditors, the key takeaway is the superior value of a segmented analytical approach. This strategy maintains high predictive accuracy while revealing nuanced, specific risks. Ultimately, it provides a powerful, tailored tool for safeguarding financial interests in an emerging market context.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-49/v1?src=rss">Forecasting Pepper and Turmeric Prices in India: A Machine Learning Analysis of Macroeconomic Drivers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Accurate forecasting of agricultural commodity prices is crucial for maintaining economic stability and informing data-driven policy interventions in emerging economies, such as India. Price volatility in key spices, such as pepper and turmeric, can significantly impact producers, consumers, and market stakeholders, underscoring the need for robust predictive models that capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies. Methods This study develops an integrated forecasting framework that combines Machine Learning (Random Forest), Deep Learning (LSTM), and Econometric (VECM) approaches to analyse the dynamic behaviour of Indian pepper and turmeric prices. The models incorporate major macroeconomic determinants, including GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rate, gold price, interest rate, trade volume, and foreign institutional investments (FII), to capture both non-linear and long-term relationships. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) metrics, alongside SHAP-based feature explainability analysis. Results The findings reveal that Random Forest delivers the most robust predictive accuracy overall, especially for Turmeric, while LSTM achieves slightly lower forecast errors for Pepper. Both machine-learning models substantially outperform the VECM in short-term price forecasts. Feature importance and SHAP analyses identified NIFTY50, GDP, CPI, exchange rate, interest rate and gold prices as key drivers of spice price movements. Conclusions Integrating machine learning, deep learning, and econometric models enhances the robustness and interpretability of commodity price forecasting. The study provides empirical evidence that macroeconomic variables significantly influence spice price dynamics, offering a hybrid framework that can support policymakers, traders, and researchers in mitigating market risks and designing more effective agricultural price stabilisation strategies.

                Habits of mind have increasingly been recognized as foundational dispositions for developing 21st-century skills and supporting sustainability-oriented education. This study presents a systematic literature review combined with bibliometric analysis to map the intellectual structure, research trends, and thematic evolution of habits of mind in educational research, with particular attention to sustainability and Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). A Scopus-based dataset of peer-reviewed publications published between 2010 and 2025 was analyzed using co-authorship, co-citation, and keyword co-occurrence techniques implemented in VOSviewer. The analysis identifies dominant research clusters related to critical thinking, STEM education, teacher education, and sustainability-oriented learning, as well as leading authors, journals, and countries contributing to the field. While sustainability-related themes are increasingly visible, explicit connections between habits of mind and SDG 6 related educational issues remain limited and unevenly distributed, particularly in the Indonesian context. The findings highlight underexplored research areas and reveal opportunities for strengthening the integration of cognitive dispositions, sustainability education, and water sanitation awareness through culturally responsive educational strategies. This study contributes by providing a structured overview of the field and clarifying research gaps to guide future educational research and policy aligned with SDG 6.

                Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for understanding species trends and their responses to anthropogenic change. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a scalable, non-invasive approach to capture ecological information across large spatial and temporal scales. However, it generates vast amounts of audio recordings, whose management and analysis present technical challenges. To support diverse user needs in ecoacoustic research, a growing number of software tools have emerged, but the landscape remains fragmented and difficult to navigate. We provide a systematic overview of software tools used for soundscape assessment across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. We screened peer-reviewed literature and complemented it with database cross-checking to identify and categorize tools according to four PAM data workflow components: data management, signal pre-processing, visualisation and navigation, and acoustic analysis. We found 221 available tools of which 174 were explicitly designed for PAM. Most tools were freely accessible (83%) with only a smaller fraction being commercial (12%) or limited access (5%). Terrestrial research accounted for most software mentions (476 studies), followed by aquatic (319) and cross-realm (64) studies. Nearly half (45%) were package-based frameworks within R, Python, or MATLAB. Acoustic analysis was the most represented workflow component, while only 40 tools covered all four of them. This diversity illustrates the field’s rapid technical growth but also its redundancy and methodological fragmentation: to date, many tools target only a subset of workflow components and replicate similar functionalities. Despite this, the prevalence of PAM-dedicated software indicates increasing specialization and technical maturity within ecoacoustics. Our structured inventory underscores the need for greater collaboration and continuity in software development, promoting the improvement and accessibility of existing tools rather than further proliferation. This living systematic review, provides a practical, biannually updated reference for tool selection and fosters transparency, comparability, and cooperation across bioacoustic and ecoacoustic research communities.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to descriptively characterize and explore the differences in the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20-40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the descriptive relationship between the relative abundance of periodontopathogens and nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was isolated and pooled in equimolar quantities from all individuals within each group to create three pooled libraries: type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3). Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity were measured using bioinformatic methods, and all analyses of sequencing data were strictly descriptive and exploratory. Salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured on individual, un-pooled samples. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (G2; G3) was observed to have greater bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to descriptive alpha-diversity analysis. The G3 group exhibited the largest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontopathogen. Descriptive analysis also suggested that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different community structures across the groups. Furthermore, comparison of individual salivary samples showed that nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the G3 group compared to the G1 group (p< 0.05). Results reveal that the inverse interaction between increased P. gingivalis and decreased nitrate-reducing bacteria serves as a descriptive hallmark for periodontal disease progression in the T2DM population. Conclusion Results of this exploratory study suggest that the relationship between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These distinct microbial features observed may be microbiological characteristics associated with the progression of periodontal disease in this population, warranting further validation as potential indicators for early management.

                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1114/v2?src=rss">Validation of the Arabic version of the smoking cessation motivation questionnaire among Tunisian student smokers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Smoking remains a major public health problem, particularly among Tunisian health students, with a prevalence of 26%. Assessing motivation to quit smoking requires tools that have been validated in the local language. This study aimed to translate and validate the psychometric properties of the Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire (Q-MAT) into Arabic. Method A cross-sectional methodological study was conducted among 203 smoking health science students in March 2022. The cross-cultural validation process followed Vallerand’s seven steps, including translation/back-translation, expert panel review, pre-testing, and psychometric analyses. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and temporal stability (test-retest). Content validity was measured by the CVI index, and construct validity by exploratory factor analysis. Results The sample included 197 students (mean age: 18.95±1.07 years, sex ratio: 0.89). The Arabic Q-MAT demonstrated excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.840, a test-retest correlation of 0.831, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.886. Content validity was satisfactory (CVI = 0.89). Principal component analysis revealed that two factors explained 89.148% of the total variance. Conclusions This initial validation of the Q-MAT in literary Arabic provides a reliable and valid tool for assessing motivation to quit smoking among Arabic-speaking populations, facilitating the development of targeted public health interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-415/v5?src=rss">Knowledge of research misconduct amid North-African post-graduate dental students: A cross sectional study [version 5; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of research misconduct (KoRM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoRM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoRM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoRM. Results The mean±SD KoRM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoRM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoRM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoRM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoRM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoRM in this population.

                Background Every day we are faced with different treatment claims, in the news, in social media, and by our family and friends. Some of these claims are true, but many are unsubstantiated. Without being supported by reliable evidence such guidance can lead to waste and harmful health choices. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Network facilitates development of interventions for teaching children and adults the ability to assess treatment claims (informedhealthchoices.org). Our objective was to develop and evaluate a new assessment tool developed from the item bank for use in an upcoming trial of lower secondary school resources in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluating a questionnaire including two item-sets was used. The first evaluated ability using multiple-choice questions (scored dichotomously) and the other evaluated intended behaviour and self-efficacy (measured using Likert scales). This study was conducted in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda in 2021. We recruited children (over 12 years old) and adults through schools and our networks. We entered 1,671 responses into our analysis. Summary and individual fit to the Rasch model (including Cronbach’s Alpha) were assessed using the RUMM2030 software. Results Both item-sets were found to have good fit to the Rasch model and were acceptable to our target audience. The reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha >0.7). Observations of the individual item and person fit provided us with guidance on how we could improve the design, scoring, and administration of the two item-sets. There was no local dependency in either of the item-sets, and both item-sets were found to have acceptable unidimensionality. Conclusion Overall, the two item-sets were found to have satisfactory measurement properties. Based on our analysis, we consider these instruments to be suitable for our target audiences in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda.

                Background Food safety is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries where inadequate hygiene practices among street food vendors contribute to foodborne illnesses. In Ghana, street-vended foods remain a common source of meals for many households, necessitating regular assessment of vendors’ food hygiene and safety practices. Objective This study assessed food hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors in the Bibiani–Anhwiaso–Bekwai Municipality of the Western North Region of Ghana. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed involving 152 street food vendors selected through purposive and simple random sampling techniques. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and observational checklists. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 15. Descriptive statistics summarized socio-demographic characteristics and hygiene practices. Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between socio-demographic factors and hygiene practices, while binary logistic regression identified predictors of good food hygiene and safety practices. Results Most vendors were female (93.4%) and married (61.8%). Awareness of food hygiene was high (92.1%). Only 56.6% of vendors had undergone medical screening, 53.3% had received food hygiene training, and 53.9% had been inspected within the past six months. Observational findings indicated that while most vendors washed foodstuffs before cooking (86.2%) and maintained clean surroundings (84.2%), some did not use aprons or hair coverings (17.8%), operated in unhygienic environments (21.7%), or lacked valid medical certificates (27.0%). Significant associations were found between hygiene practices and educational level, prior food hygiene training, and municipal health inspections (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that food hygiene training and regular inspections significantly increased the likelihood of practicing safe food handling. Conclusion Despite high awareness of food hygiene, adherence to recommended hygiene and safety practices among street food vendors remains suboptimal. Strengthening food hygiene training, enhancing regulatory enforcement, and improving environmental sanitation are essential to improve food safety and protect public health. Recommendation The government of Ghana and MMDAs should establish the pre-requisite standard operating procedures for all institutions undertaking hospitality regarding food safety and hygiene.

                Animals respond to environmental cues to time phenological events, but the intrinsic mechanism of circannual timing remains elusive. We used transcriptomic sequencing and frequent sampling of multiple hypothalamic nuclei in Djungarian hamsters to examine the neural and molecular architecture of circannual interval timing. Our study identified three distinct phases of transcript changes, with deiodinase type-3 (<i>Dio3</i>) expression activated during the early induction phase. Subsequent work demonstrated that targeted mutation of <i>Dio3</i> using CRISPR–Cas resulted in a shorter period for circannual interval timing. Hamsters that are non-responsive to short photoperiods and fail to show any winter adaptations do not display changes in <i>Dio3</i> expression and do not show any change in body mass or pelage. Our work demonstrates that changes in <i>Dio3</i> induction are essential for setting the period of circannual interval timing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98254">Establishing synthetic ribbon-type active zones in a heterologous expression system</a></h4>

              
                Encoding of several sensory modalities into neural signals is mediated by ribbon synapses. The synaptic ribbon tethers synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone (AZ) and may act as a super-scaffold organizing AZ topography. Here, we employed a synthetic biology approach to reconstitute structures mimicking ribbon-type AZs in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells for probing minimal molecular requirements and studying presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering. Co-expressing a membrane-targeted version of the AZ protein Bassoon and the ribbon core protein RIBEYE, we observed structures recapitulating basic aspects of ribbon-type AZs, which we call <i>synthetic</i> ribbons or <i>SyRibbons</i>. Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and cryo-correlative electron tomography revealed <i>SyRibbons</i> were similar to native ribbons at AZs of cochlear inner hair cells in shape and size. <i>SyRibbons</i> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters formed upon additional expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and RIM-binding protein 2 (RBP2). Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters associated with <i>SyRibbons</i> were larger than ribbonless Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters, and functional analysis by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in combination with patch clamp showed partial confinement of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at <i>SyRibbons</i>. In summary, we identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, RBP, membrane-anchored Bassoon, and RIBEYE as minimal components for reconstituting a basic ribbon-type AZ. <i>SyRibbons</i> might complement animal studies on molecular interactions of AZ proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97106">Brain-derived estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen receptor signaling in medaka</a></h4>

              
                In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates, including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here, we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens in facilitating male-typical behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100851">Between-species variation in neocortical sulcal anatomy of the carnivoran brain</a></h4>

              
                Carnivorans are an important study object for comparative neuroscience, as they exhibit a wide range of behaviours, ecological adaptations, and social structures. Previous studies have mainly examined relative brain size, but a comprehensive understanding of brain diversity requires the investigation of other aspects of their neuroanatomy. Here, we obtained primarily post-mortem brain scans from 26 species of the order Carnivora, spanning across eight families with diverse representatives and including additional individuals for selected species, to create the largest carnivoran brain collection to date. We reconstructed their cortical surfaces and examined neocortical sulcal anatomy to establish a framework for systematic interspecies comparisons, revealing distinct regional variations in sulcal anatomy, potentially related to the species’ behaviour and ecology. Arctoidea species with pronounced forepaw dexterity exhibited complex sulcal configurations in the presumed somatosensory cortex but low sulcal complexity in the presumed visual and auditory occipitotemporal cortex. Canidae had the largest number of unique major sulci, including one in the occipital cortex and highly social canids featuring an additional frontal cortex sulcus. We also observed differentially complex occipitotemporal sulcal patterns in Felidae and Canidae, indicative of changes in auditory and visual areas that may be related to foraging strategies and social behaviour. In conclusion, this study presents an inventory of the sulcal anatomy of a number of rarely studied carnivoran brains including detailed digital atlases and establishes a framework and novel avenues for further investigations employing a variety of neuroimaging modalities to reveal more about carnivoran brain diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99656">ATP burst is the dominant driver of antibiotic lethality in Mycobacterium smegmatis</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, due to their unique physiology, are refractory to antimicrobial killing and pose challenges for infection control. Incomplete knowledge of how bactericidal antibiotics work limits our understanding of partial resistance due to phenotypic tolerance in mycobacteria, a driver for developing genetic resistance. Using proteomics, <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis, genetic and biochemical assays, we investigated the physiological response of <i>M. smegmatis</i> challenged with aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Two distinct classes of antibiotics elicited remarkably similar responses and increased flux through the TCA cycle, causing enhanced respiration, ROS generation, and ATP burst. We observed that excessive ATP levels and not ROS dominantly contribute to cidality, which may in part be conferred by sequestration of divalent metal ions by ATP. Consequently, <sup>13</sup>C isotope tracing indicated TCA cycle flux deviation from its oxidative arm as a bacterial adaptive mechanism, which also included activated intrinsic resistance and a higher propensity to develop antibiotic resistance. Our study provides a new understanding of the intricate mechanisms of antibiotic-induced cell death and expands the current paradigm for antibiotic action.

">Non-invasive tracking of hippocampal theta oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal theta oscillations play a crucial role in the formation of episodic memories by binding multisensory information into coherent episodes. Brain stimulation studies suggest that memory performance can be modulated by targeting these oscillations, offering a potential way of treating memory disorders. However, to effectively engage these rhythms, precise knowledge about their presence, frequency, phase and location is required, which has been a challenge, particularly for non-invasive methods such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Here, we first asked if hippocampal signals are detectable in MEG recordings. Using simultaneous MEG-intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, we show that invasively recorded hippocampal activity is reflected in MEG sensor signals, demonstrating the feasibility of detecting deep-brain activity non-invasively. Building on this, we introduce a MEG-based analysis pipeline to track hippocampal theta frequency over time. Applied across three independent datasets, the pipeline captured characteristic hippocampal theta frequency patterns in both rodents and humans, and MEG-derived hippocampal frequencies were consistent with those observed simultaneously in intracranial EEG. These findings provide evidence that MEG can reliably track individual hippocampal oscillatory dynamics, paving the way for future non-invasive closed-loop interventions that adapt stimulation frequency and timing to ongoing oscillations.

">fNIRS Characterization of Temporal Potentiation During Optimized Nerve Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Restoring stable somatosensory feedback through transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) represents a significant challenge in neural engineering; however, the cortical dynamics underlying sensory habituation are not yet well characterized. This study utilizes a multi-method functional near-infrared spectroscopy framework to quantify the temporal evolution of cortical engagement during optimized TNS. It was hypothesized that stimulation parameters fundamentally constrain the spatiotemporal profile of the hemodynamic response function. A General Linear Model with temporal and dispersion derivatives was used to analyze hemodynamic responses in 10 participants across three phases: validation, duration optimization (2, 5, or 10 seconds), and sustained engagement (45 minutes). During the optimization phase, 5-second stimulation produced the highest canonical amplitude with optimal dispersion characteristics, while 10-second trains resulted in significant temporal delays. During the sustained phase, parametric modeling indicated no linear decay in cortical response. Instead, the cortex demonstrated temporal potentiation, characterized by a transition from sparse early-phase activation to widespread late-phase recruitment across the sensorimotor network. The left posterior parietal cortex (BA5) served as a continuous integration hub, whereas primary somatosensory regions exhibited dynamic late-onset engagement. These findings quantify a nonlinear adaptation mechanism whereby engineered temporal spacing prevents neural saturation. The observed intersubject heterogeneity highlights the necessity for adaptive, closed-loop TNS controllers guided by real-time hemodynamic biomarkers.

">Molecular, cellular and network mapping of brain structural deviations in patients with Post-COVID19 syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Post-COVID-19 syndrome encompasses persistent cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, profoundly affecting global quality of life. Clarifying the neurobiological basis of these symptoms is vital for effective therapeutic interventions. This study utilized normative modelling of brain structure ("CentileBrain") to quantify individualized deviations in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes among 20 patients experiencing persistent fatigue following mild COVID-19, compared to 20 matched healthy controls. Group-level analyses on deviation scores revealed subtle yet distinct regional alterations in cortical thickness, specifically decreased thickness within orbitofrontal cortices and increased thickness in occipital/sensory cortices. Although at the individual regional level, the proportion of patients exhibiting infranormal or supranormal thickness values was relatively low (<35%) and comparable to controls, deviations frequently clustered within structurally connected circuits, affecting up to 50% more of patients. Spatial analysis of regional cortical thickness alterations correlated significantly with the constitutive expression patterns of TMPRSS2, an essential protein facilitating SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Canonical correlation analyses further identified specific cell-type distributions and neuroreceptor densities predictive of regional thickness changes, highlighting neurons and molecular targets associated with serotoninergic, cannabinoid, cholinergic, and glutamatergic signalling pathways. Network-diffusion modelling constrained by a canonical structural connectome significantly outperformed null models based on permuted connectomes and Euclidean distance metrics, identifying posterior-parietal regions as probable initiation points ("seeds") for network-wide structural changes. Seed likelihood correlated positively with TMPRSS2 expression levels, suggesting that these posterior-parietal regions may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights a plausible mechanism where structural alterations could propagate through connected neural networks, although direct evidence of such propagation requires further investigation. These findings provide novel insights into potential mechanisms underlying neural circuit disruptions in post-COVID-19 fatigue and suggest avenues for therapeutic neuromodulation.

">A hypothalamo-septo-hippocampal circuit for REM sleep-dependent consolidation of social memory</a></h4>

              
                REM sleep constitutes a critical window for memory consolidation, yet the brain circuits orchestrating this process remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify a lateral supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-medial septum (MS) projection as a REM sleep-specialized pathway essential for hippocampal memory consolidation. Fiber photometry and optrode recordings revealed that lateral SuM-MS projecting neurons were selectively active during REM sleep. REM-specific optogenetic silencing of this projection impaired consolidation of both social and contextual fear memories. Crucially, silencing of its downstream target, the MS-CA2 pathway, during REM sleep selectively disrupted social memory while sparing contextual fear memory. This functional dissection establishes a hypothalamo-septo-hippocampal circuit (lateral SuM-MS-CA2) dedicated to social memory processing, in parallel to the recently-described direct SuM-CA2 pathway. These results also position the SuM as a REM sleep-hub that routes information via parallel septal pathways to consolidate distinct memory modalities.

">Transplantation of Human IPSC-derived Microglia Ameliorates Neuropathology and Circuit Dysfunction in Progranulin-Deficient Mice</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a major cause of early-onset neurodegeneration characterized by progressive behavioral, emotional, and cognitive decline. Progranulin haploinsufficiency, a leading genetic cause of familial FTD, disrupts lysosomal function, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and neuroimmune signaling across multiple cell types. Increasing evidence indicates that microglia are particularly sensitive to progranulin loss, exhibiting elevated complement activation that contributes to TDP-43 proteinopathy and neuronal dysfunction. Here, we investigate the biological role of restoring progranulin exclusively within microglia by transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) into progranulin (Grn)-deficient mice. We find that wild-type, but not Grn-deficient, human iMG restore brain-wide progranulin levels, normalize microglial transcriptional states, and ameliorate pathological, functional, and behavioral phenotypes associated with progranulin loss. Because microglia are the only source of progranulin in this system, these findings demonstrate that microglial progranulin is sufficient to restore key aspects of cellular, circuit, and behavioral homeostasis in a progranulin-deficient FTD model. More broadly, this work highlights a central, microglia-intrinsic role for progranulin in maintaining brain function and provides a framework for dissecting microglia-specific mechanisms across FTD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

">Microglia Piezo1 aggravates cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury by chemotactic recruitment of T lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a complex pathophysiological process involving multiple mechanisms. Piezo1, a stretch-activated ion channel, has recently emerged as a potential regulator of cellular responses to ischemic conditions. However, its role in specific cells during ischemic events is not well elucidated. Here, we showed that after experimentally induced CIRI, Piezo1 channel was highly expressed in peri-infarct area, where is upregulated and activated mainly in microglia. Behavioral tests, and infarct volume measurements demonstrated that conditional Piezo1 deficient in microglia markedly ameliorated the neurological deficits and reduced the infarct volumes. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining showed decreased peripheral immune cells, especially T lymphocytes infiltration into the brain in microglia Piezo1 deficient mice after stroke. Multiplex chemokine immunoassay and T cell migration assays screened that Piezo1 deficient microglia blocked the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) release from astrocyte, which lead to the inhibited T cell recruitment in transwell co-cultured system. Furthermore, RNA-Sequencing analysis showed that defective Piezo1 in microglia lead to its polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to cerebral ischemia and reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}). Collectively, Piezo1 deficiency inhibited the secretion of TNF-? and IFN-? in microglia. The reduction of these inflammatory cytokines further blocked the CXCL10 release from astrocyte, and ultimately ameliorated the infiltration of peripheral T lymphocytes after stroke. Our results therefore highlight the critical role of Piezo1 in microglia-orchestrated neuroinflammation and suggest a potential means for reducing stroke-induced neurological injury.

">Multimodal imaging suggests potential immune-vascular contributions to altered regional brain perfusion and oxygen metabolism in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS) frequently presents with persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and emotional symptoms. Although structural brain changes remain subtle, growing evidence implicates functional and metabolic disruptions in ongoing symptomatology. We used multimodal MRI to investigate cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism in PCS and examined their associations with cognitive function and peripheral biomarkers. We enrolled 40 individuals with prior mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 20 with persistent fatigue and 20 recovered controls matched for age, sex, BMI, and acute COVID-19 severity. Participants underwent structural MRI, arterial spin labelling (ASL) to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), and asymmetric spin echo imaging to estimate oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). We assessed cognition using an online battery and measured serum levels of TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IFN-{gamma}, GFAP, and S100{beta}, alongside blood routine tests. We performed ANCOVAs on predefined regions of interest (hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], insula, amygdala, striatum), followed by Bayesian inference and exploratory whole-brain analyses. PCS participants showed increased CMRO2 in the hippocampus and decreased CMRO2 in the ACC. Subfield analysis revealed elevated OEF and CMRO2 across most hippocampal regions, excluding the entorhinal cortex. Whole-brain analyses identified increased perfusion in salience-related regions (insula, ACC, thalamus) and decreased perfusion in posterior cortical and cerebellar areas, in the absence of grey matter volume differences. Higher hippocampal metabolism positively correlated with cognitive performance, suggesting compensatory adaptation to sustain function. In contrast, lower ACC CMRO2 correlated with depressive symptoms, reduced motivation, and elevated TNF- and GFAP, consistent with neurovascular uncoupling possibly driven by immune-glial activation. These findings reveal distinct physiological disruptions in PCS, with potential implications for stratified, metabolism-focused interventions.

">Anterior insula activity during alcohol and social reward self-administration and choice in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the prioritization of alcohol over healthier non-alcohol rewards, posing significant challenges for addiction treatment. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving this maladaptive preference is crucial for effective intervention. We previously showed that rats will choose alcohol over social reward in a discrete-choice task. Here, we used fiber photometry to investigate how anterior insula cortex (aIC) activity relates to choice and employed Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) modelling to dissect the underlying decision processes. Male and female rats, transfected with calcium indicator jGCaMP7f in aIC, were trained to lever-press for either social reward or alcohol (20% ethanol) in alternating sessions, followed by discrete-choice sessions, and then punishment of alcohol choices. Rats developed a preference for alcohol over social reward, which was reversed when alcohol choices were punished. Model output successfully described this behaviour with the model-derived 'decision bias' tracking preference across all phases. Photometry recordings showed that, as alcohol preference emerged, increased aIC activity during the cue period preceding alcohol choices (relative to social choices) was significantly correlated with decision bias towards alcohol. During punishment, aIC activity bias was no longer related to decision bias, despite the preference shift. These results demonstrate that aIC activity is linked to alcohol reward and choice and suggest that aIC contributes to alcohol preference by encoding a bias in the evidence accumulation process. This highlights a specific role of aIC in the cognitive mechanisms of alcohol-seeking, and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

">Brain dynamics of attentional, default-mode and limbic networks are disrupted at rest in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Background Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is characterised by persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and affective symptoms, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Although resting-state neuroimaging studies have reported alterations in static functional connectivity, such approaches fail to capture the brain's intrinsically dynamic organisation. Cognitive and emotional functions depend on the flexible reconfiguration of large-scale brain networks over time; disruptions in the exploration of, and transitions between, functional brain states may therefore play a key role in PCS pathophysiology. Methods Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 20 individuals with PCS (mean age = 41.8 +/- 9.4 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age = 40.6 +/- 8.1 years) using a multi-echo acquisition. Following denoising with multi-echo independent component analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA) was applied to identify recurrent patterns of whole-brain phase synchrony. The optimal number of dynamic brain states was determined using the Dunn index. For each state, probability of occurrence, lifetime, and transition probabilities were quantified, and spatial topographies were mapped onto canonical functional networks. Group differences were assessed using ANCOVAs controlling for age, sex, and handedness. Exploratory associations with clinical symptoms, cognitive performance, and peripheral inflammatory markers were examined using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Results Five recurrent dynamic brain states were identified. Compared with controls, individuals with PCS showed a reduced probability of occurrence and shorter lifetime of a visual/dorsal attention state, alongside an increased probability of a limbic/default mode network (DMN) state. PCS was further characterised by reduced transitions between visual/dorsal attention and frontoparietal/DMN states, and increased transitions from somatomotor/visual states toward the limbic/DMN configuration. Exploratory analyses revealed that greater expression of the limbic/DMN state was associated with poorer global cognitive performance (MoCA) and higher serum interleukin-1 beta levels. Conclusions PCS is associated with a reorganisation of intrinsic brain dynamics, marked by a shift from externally oriented attentional states toward limbic/DMN configurations. This pattern suggests reduced cognitive flexibility and increased weighting of interoceptive or affective signals. The observed associations between dynamic brain-state expression, cognitive dysfunction, and peripheral inflammation support a systems-level mechanism through which immune signalling may influence large-scale neural dynamics in PCS. Dynamic functional connectivity provides a sensitive framework for characterising post-viral brain dysfunction and may inform future mechanistic models and therapeutic strategies.

">Cocaine and caffeine elicit different dopamine receptor-mediated locomotor activity profiles: insights from a new model.</a></h4>

              
                Background: The locomotor activity elicited by cocaine and caffeine can be distinguished via their underlying mechanisms and via differential responses to neuropharmacological manipulations. However, both cocaine- and caffeine-induced locomotor activity can be blocked by non-selective dopamine receptor antagonists, implying that we may not be able to distinguish their locomotor activity at the level of the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism. With the rationale that this limitation may be due to a lack of sensitivity of current methods, we have developed a new Quantitative Structure of Curve Analytical (QSCAn) model. We hypothesized that QSCAn will be more effective, relative to the current model, in differentiating the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism of cocaine versus caffeine-induced locomotor activity. Methods: We assessed locomotor activity (quantified as distance traveled in cm over time) due to injections of saline (n = 6), cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p, n = 8) and caffeine (20 mg/kg i.p, n = 6) in male Sprague Dawley rats with and without pretreatment with vehicle and cis-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg i.p, non-selective dopamine receptor blocker)(current model). Because distance traveled over time follows an inverted u-shaped time-response curve, we employed gaussian fit of this structure to obtain several behavioral variables (QSCAn model). We compared both models. Results: The current model could not distinguish the locomotor activity profile of cocaine versus caffeine following vehicle and cis-flupenthixol pretreatments. QSCAn model could distinguish cocaine versus caffeine in the presence and absence of non-selective dopamine receptor blockade. Conclusions: The new QSCAn model may be a promising tool to distinguish/characterize different psychostimulant-related effects.

                Progressive increases in cocaine craving or seeking during abstinence from cocaine are thought to contribute to relapse. Recent observations suggest that sleep disruptions during abstinence from cocaine may have a significant influence on cocaine seeking. While the neural mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disruptions and increases in cocaine seeking during abstinence continue to be investigated, alterations in mesolimbic dopamine transmission may be a common factor. In these studies, we assessed whether sleep disruptions during abstinence are associated with incubation of cocaine seeking and dopamine terminal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens core of female and male rats. We observed that intermittent access to cocaine followed by abstinence reduced rapid-eye movement sleep, intensified cue-induced cocaine seeking, and enhanced dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Notably, a sleep restoration procedure that restricted sleep to the light phase (active period) restored rapid-eye movement sleep, prevented incubation of cocaine seeking, and normalized baseline dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. These findings indicate that rapid-eye movement sleep disruptions during abstinence contribute to exaggerated cocaine seeking and that dopamine transporter adaptations are a potential molecular substrate through which these changes occur. Thus, interventions that restore sleep during cocaine abstinence may serve as effective behavioral therapies for reducing cocaine craving and preventing subsequent relapse.

">Repeated Mild Head Injury Establishes a Senescent Cranial Bone Marrow Niche that Impairs Brain Metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severity is associated with long-term systemic inflammation and increased risk of peripheral comorbidities, yet the mechanisms driving immune dysregulation and accelerated aging after repeated mild head impacts remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of repeated mild TBI (rmTBI) on distal and proximal bone marrow compartments in the femur and calvaria, respectively. Using a modified weight-drop mouse model delivering rotational and acceleration/deceleration forces (3 hits/week for up to 16 weeks), rmTBI produced no mortality, skull fracture, hemorrhage, or brain leukocyte infiltration. One day after three consecutive impacts, rmTBI induced robust proliferation of LSK stem/progenitor cells in both femoral and calvarial marrow, evidenced by Ki67 expression, BrdU incorporation, and increased monocyte output. By 8 weeks (24 impacts), injury-induced proliferation subsided and LSK cells exhibited increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. At 16 weeks (48 impacts), LSK populations were depleted at both sites, displaying reduced proliferative capacity, telomere shortening, and pancytopenia in otherwise young adult mice. Calvarial bone marrow cells exposed to rmTBI released a distinct cytokine and proteomic secretome marked by elevated IL-6, suppressed mitochondrial and metabolic signaling, and enhanced DNA repair pathways. Notably, skull-derived secretome factors impaired cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced microglial mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings identify replicative senescence of the brain-adjacent bone marrow niche as an early and progressive consequence of repeated mild head injury, linking rmTBI to long-lasting metabolic dysfunction, impaired immunity, and accelerated aging.

">A Drosophila screen identifies domino as a link between chromatin regulation and synaptic organization</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with diverse genetic risk factors. To identify conserved mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes, we conducted a targeted screen in Drosophila using MiMIC insertion mutants of high-confidence genes from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database. Behavioral assays identified 52 heterozygous lines with significant changes in sleep, activity, or social behavior in one or both sexes. Among these, the chromatin remodeler domino (dom), the ortholog of human SRCAP, emerged as a particularly compelling candidate. Heterozygous dom mutants exhibited altered social spacing and male-biased sleep and activity dysregulation, phenotypes that were replicated in an additional allele. RNA-sequencing of adult brains showed that reduced dom expression affected genes involved in signaling and structural pathways in both sexes, offering potential molecular links to the behavioral outcomes. In addition, dom disruption caused widespread splicing dysregulation, with differentially spliced genes enriched for pathways related to synaptic signaling, further implicating synaptic communication as a convergent mechanism. Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence revealed increased synaptic architecture in the antennal lobe, a brain region associated with sleep and sensory processing. Together, these findings highlight the utility of Drosophila for modeling conserved ASD risk genes and implicate domino in the regulation of synaptic communication and behavior through transcriptional and splicing regulation.

">Drowsiness alters the neural dynamics but not the core computations of multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                Fluctuations in alertness shape perception and behaviour, yet how they affect the brain's ability to integrate information across senses remains poorly understood. Here we investigated whether multisensory integration is preserved as humans transition from wakefulness to drowsiness. Participants performed an audio-tactile detection task while electroencephalography tracked spontaneous declines in alertness. Behaviourally, multisensory stimulation continued to facilitate responses during drowsiness, despite slowing and increased omissions. However, reaction-time distributions revealed reduced violations of race-model predictions, indicating weakened computational evidence for multisensory integration. Neurally, event-related signatures of multisensory interactions were delayed and attenuated during drowsiness. By contrast, multivariate decoding showed that multisensory neural representations remained detectable, although less temporally stable. Crucially, early cross-state generalization revealed shared representational structure across alertness states, indicating preserved core multisensory computations. These findings show that multisensory integration remains functional but is dynamically altered as alertness declines, revealing how the brain maintains adaptive behaviour during the wake-to-sleep transition.

">The impact of homeostatic inhibitory plasticity in a generative biophysical model</a></h4>

              
                A main characteristic of biological systems is their capacity to dynamically adapt to environmental changes. In the brain, synaptic plasticity enables the strengthening or weakening of connections between neurons, allowing neural circuits to adapt based on experience, learning, and environmental changes. Yet, it is homeostatically regulated such that it avoids excessive proliferation of synaptic contacts. These mechanisms can be studied with large-scale models of brain activity. Here, we embed a biologically grounded inhibitor homeostatic-plasticity rule into the Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) model, creating a Homeostatic Dynamic Mean Field (HDMF) model that dynamically tunes local excitation-inhibition balance. Convergence of excitatory firing rates is reached by mapping a large range of coupling strength to parameters of inhibitory synapses. The HDMF reproduces statistical observables of brain activity as well as the original DMF, and can sustain neuromodulatory perturbations without overhead computations. The HDMF can generate unprecedented sleep-like slow-wave activity, which can also coexist with wake-like asynchronous dynamics, permitting to model dissociated states of consciousness such as parasomnias. Together, these results show that a single homeostatic rule broadens the stability and expressiveness of the DMF, providing a unified platform for studying how local adaptive processes shape the diverse global dynamics of the human brain.

">Lipid metabolic suppression accompanies an immunometabolic signature in the spinal cord during chronic neuropathic pain.</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuropathic pain is maintained by persistent spinal cord adaptations, yet the chronic-phase spinal metabolic state and its cross-model reproducibility remain insufficiently defined. Here, we performed GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics of ipsilateral spinal cord tissue at day 7 after spinal nerve transection (SNT) and integrated these findings with pathway analyses of four independent spinal cord RNA-seq datasets from distinct neuropathic pain models. Metabolomic profiling robustly separated SNT from sham samples and revealed an immune-associated metabolic signature characterized by increased lactic acid, itaconic acid, and glycine, accompanied by broad depletion of GC-MS-detectable free fatty-acid pools. Pathway-level analyses supported coordinated remodeling consistent with inflammatory metabolism alongside reduced lipid-related programs. Across independent RNA-seq datasets, Hallmark GSEA and KEGG pathway analyses (WebGestalt) consistently showed upregulation of immune/inflammatory programs with concomitant downregulation of fatty acid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Together, these multi-omics results define a reproducible chronic-phase spinal signature in which an immunometabolic state accompanies lipid metabolic suppression, providing a cross-model framework for biomarker identification and hypothesis generation in neuropathic pain.

">Modeling predicts a biochemical feedback mechanism underlying astrocyte calcium refractory periods</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes exhibit intracellular calcium fluctuations in response to neuronal activity. Repeated receptor stimulation can induce a transient suppression of calcium signaling--a refractory period--yet the underlying mechanisms and timescales of this phenomenon during behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we present a biophysically grounded computational model of astrocytic calcium signaling that incorporates a novel feedback mechanism mediated by conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) and predicts the refractory phenomenon. Unlike previous models developed in vitro, our model is directly validated using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging data from behaving mice. It closely recapitulates astrocytic calcium dynamics across both time and frequency domains, including the emergence of refractory periods and their negative correlation with inter-stimulus intervals. Simulations further predict the timing of recovery from refractory states, consistent with experimental observations. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for astrocytic refractory behavior and establishes a framework for integrating computational modeling with in vivo functional imaging.

">Dopamine Accumulation Dynamics Control Time Perception</a></h4>

              
                Accurate timing is fundamental to perception and behavior, and the dopaminergic system plays a key role. According to the dopamine clock hypothesis, elevated dopamine accelerates the interval clock, while reduced levels slow it. However, optogenetic activation of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons paradoxically disrupts this model, suggesting greater complexity. To resolve this paradox, we monitored ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine activity in mice performing a time perception task. We observed a ramping-to-threshold pattern, where slower ramping corresponded to longer durations. Optogenetic activation accelerated time estimation, whereas inhibition prolonged it. Systemic dopamine elevation had no effect, but reuptake inhibition accelerated timing. Strikingly, prolonged high dopamine levels slowed time estimation, correlating with slower accumulation due to increased reuptake. Our findings challenge the dopamine clock hypothesis, demonstrating that time perception depends not on absolute dopamine levels but on their temporal accumulation dynamics. This revised framework reconciles previous contradictions and highlights the role of dopamine accumulation rates in temporal cognition.

                Reliable and reproducible measurement of spatial resolution is essential for validating and comparing the performance of two-photon microscopy systems. We present fluorescent nanodiamonds as robust, photostable, reusable, and biocompatible probes for benchmarking spatial resolution. Owing to their nanoscale dimensions and stable fluorescence, nanodiamonds act as near-ideal point-like emitters, enabling accurate characterisation of the point spread function across varying imaging conditions. We demonstrate that nanodiamond-based phantoms serve as a reliable alternative to conventional fluorescent beads embedded in agarose, while at the same time offering advantages in stability and optical properties. Our results position nanodiamond phantoms as a next-generation calibration material that bridges ease of use and reproducibility, advancing quantitative imaging and cross-platform comparability in modern fluorescence microscopy.

">Tilted striatofugal balance and beneficial effects of facilitating mGlu4 receptor activity in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, no approved pharmacological treatment alleviates social impairments in patients with FXS. Since D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (SPNs) were shown to regulate ASD-sensitive behaviors, we explored whether the balance of activity between D1- and D2-SPNs would be biased in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of FXS. We evaluated striatal function in Fmr1-/- and Fmr1+/+ mice under pharmacological challenge and performed RNAscope(R) in situ hybridization following social interaction to assess the activity of SPNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS). We evidenced a decrease in D1-SPN activity, biasing the D1/D2-SPN balance towards an excessive weight of D2-SPN outputs. We then evaluated the effects of compounds that repress D2-SPN activity on behavioral impairments in Fmr1-/- mice. Systemically facilitating mGlu4 or blocking A2A receptor activity relieved behavioral deficits in this model. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that a tilt of the D1/D2-SPN balance in Fmr1-/- mice may contribute to their social deficit by facilitating mGlu4 activity directly in the projection site of NAc D2-SPNs. Social interaction in Fmr1-/- mice was fully rescued by photopharmacological activation of mGlu4 in the ventral pallidum (VP), where NAc D2-SPNs project. This result supports our hypothesis of excessive D2-SPN outputs and highlights the contribution of the VP in controlling social behavior. In conclusion, pharmacological compounds that repress D2-SPN activity demonstrate a promising therapeutic potential to relieve ASD-like deficits in FXS.

">LRRK2 regulates ArfGAP1 membrane localization, activity and neuronal toxicity via phosphorylation within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing a Roc GTPase domain and a serine/threonine-directed protein kinase domain, with PD-linked mutations known to enhance LRRK2 kinase activity and neuronal toxicity. Our previous studies identified the Golgi protein, ADP-Ribosylation Factor GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (ArfGAP1), as a novel modifier of LRRK2-induced cellular toxicity, where it can serve as a GAP-like protein and a robust kinase substrate of LRRK2. Here, we further explore the phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 by LRRK2 and its functional consequences. LRRK2 mediates the robust phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif at residues Ser284, Thr291 and Thr292. We mutated these three phosphorylation sites, either alone or combined, to create hydrophobic phospho-null or charged phospho-mimicking versions of ArfGAP1. We find that modulating ArfGAP1 phosphorylation impairs its normal capacity to induce Golgi fragmentation upon overexpression in neural cells. Blocking phosphorylation impairs ArfGAP1-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition in primary neurons and protects against the neurotoxic effects of PD-linked G2019S LRRK2. ArfGAP1 interactome analysis in neural cells identifies 114 putative interacting proteins with a proportion of these unexpectedly localized to mitochondria, including the outer membrane proteins Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) 1-3. An ArfGAP1 triple phospho-mimic displays an increased interaction with mitochondrial VDACs owing to the redistribution of ArfGAP1 from the cis-Golgi to the cytoplasm. Promoting ArfGAP1 phosphorylation also blocks the formation of Golgi-derived vesicles following mild ER stress. Our data provides evidence for a complex functional interaction between LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 that serves to regulate ArfGAP1 subcellular localization, protein interactions, activity and neuronal toxicity via LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of its membrane-binding ALPS2 motif. Our findings support additional validation of ArfGAP1 as a putative therapeutic target for modulating LRRK2-linked PD.

">Odor Sampling Bags Enable Reliable Delivery of Controlled Odor Concentrations</a></h4>

              
                Precise control of odorant concentration is essential for reliable olfactory research, yet existing odorant delivery methods often suffer from solvent interactions and dilution from ambient air, limiting stimulus consistency in olfactory research. We developed an odor sampling bag system using Nalophan plastic to create a closed headspace with air as the carrier medium, eliminating solvent-related variability and ambient air dilution. In two independent experiments, 15 trained panelists each rated the perceived intensity of seven concentrations of benzaldehyde and 2-heptanone using both gas-sampling bags and glass jars. Bags produced higher maximum perceptual intensities (p < 0.001) and greater test-retest reliability than jars (Experiment 1: r = 0.89 vs. 0.81, p < 0.001; Experiment 2: r = 0.86 vs. 0.72, p < 0.001). Notably, the two tested odorants showed different maximum intensities in bags (p < 0.001) but not jars (p = 0.85), suggesting bags better preserve odorant-specific concentration differences. Photoionization detector measurements confirmed stable headspace concentrations over time, comparable to industry-standard Tedlar bags. This cost-effective approach offers improved stimulus control for olfactory psychophysics research.

">ACPC-MAP: A protocol for manually aligning structural T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images to the Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure plane according to clinical standards.</a></h4>

              
                Realigning structural MR images to stereotactic AC-PC space is a standard procedure that enhances anatomical consistency both within and across neuroimaging studies, allowing for precise spatial localization and reliable cross-subject comparisons in both clinical and research contexts. However, different versions of AC-PC spaces, stemming from varying definitions of the AC-PC axis as outlined in common stereotactic atlases like Talairach and Schaltenbrand, often lead to discrepancies between the neurosurgical and neuroimaging communities. Manual realignment of structural MR images to the clinically used version of the AC-PC plane is often necessary to validate the results of automated methods or to realign the image when these methods fail. Furthermore, manual realignment provides a critical ground truth for the development of new automated tools. However, such manual interventions are typically performed in a non-standardised manner by domain experts who possess the specialized knowledge of neuroanatomy and neuroimaging required to ensure accurate alignment. To address these challenges, we have developed and validated a standardized protocol for manually realigning structural MR images to the clinically used Schaltenbrand AC-PC plane, using a set of visual criteria to ensure accurate realignment. This protocol can be used to manually align images, verify results, validate existing automated methods, or generate ground truth data for developing new automated techniques.

">Locomotor savings relies on attentional control of walking in older, but not younger adults</a></h4>

              
                The ability to recall learned movements and rapidly adapt to environmental changes, known as locomotor savings, is crucial for mobility in community-dwelling older adults. However, the influence of aging on locomotor savings and the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. Attentional compensation is a particularly relevant mechanism because the control of automatic motor behaviors like walking tend to recruit more attentional/executive resources with aging. We hypothesize that locomotor savings is diminished with age and relies on attentional rather than automatic control of walking. To test this, we compared savings of a novel walking pattern learned on a split-belt treadmill, where each leg moves at a different speed, across multiple days in 21 older and 21 younger adults. Attentional control of walking was assessed by overground dual-task walking while prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that older adults exhibited less locomotor savings than younger adults after practice. Older adults also relied more on attentional resources during dual-task walking. Importantly, greater locomotor savings was associated with higher attentional control of walking in older adults, suggesting that the use of attentional resources during challenging walking facilitates the recall of previously learned movements. These results indicate that cognitive compensation strategies utilizing attentional resources are important neural mechanisms modulating locomotor savings. Understanding the role of cognitive compensation in locomotor savings may inform rehabilitation design to enhance mobility in older adults ensuring movement corrections practiced in clinical settings are saved for long-term benefit in daily life.

">Stimulated human cortical waves: spatiotemporal dynamics across development</a></h4>

              
                Traveling waves of neural activity are fundamental to cortical function, yet their spatiotemporal dynamics and structural constraints remain less understood in human brain. Conventional analyses focus on network topology and spatial geometry of neural signals, with limited emphasis on wave dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we applied a manifold-based optical flow algorithm to an open-access intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset from the single-pulse stimulation cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) paradigm, enabling direct construction of high-temporal-resolution cortical neural activity velocity fields. Spatiotemporal mode decomposition revealed a hierarchical organization: large-scale plane waves (mediating global propagation) dominate, complemented by local patterns for local computation. Dominant plane wave directions correlate with underlying white matter fibre tract orientations, indicating anatomical guidance of cortical dynamics. Velocity field singularities (sources, sinks, spirals and saddles) are non-randomly distributed, associating with default mode network (DMN) hubs. We further identified a nonlinear relationship between cortical wave speed and age, with developmental phases paralleling white matter maturation and aging. Our findings link cortical wave dynamics to anatomy, functional networks, and neurodevelopment, establishing wave speed as a potential yet important biomarker for brain function and health.

">CA inhibitor 1 treatment has only transient effects on estrous cyclicity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 45% of new HIV infections worldwide occur in women and girls and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection is limited. Long-acting PrEP such as lenacapavir may improve adherence. One barrier to PrEP usage in women and girls is impact on the menstrual cycle, though impacts of long-acting PrEP are unclear. To model the effect of lenacapavir administration on cyclicity, adult female C57Bl/6J mice were injected with CA inhibitor 1 and assessed for estrous cyclicity. Ca inhibitor 1 transiently delayed the start of the next cycle. However, Ca inhibitor 1 was associated with a higher proportion of normal length estrous cycles. Ca inhibitor 1 did not impact astrocyte immunoreactivity or chronic cellular activity in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a major regulator of the estrous cycle. These findings suggest that lenacapavir may be a viable PrEP alternative for those concerned with PrEP impacts on menstrual cycle.

">Tau-induced ribosomal collisions impair memory through the activation of the integrated stress response</a></h4>

              
                The formation of new long-term memories is reliant upon the spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA translation. Translational control has been demonstrated to be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, which exhibit impairments in both homeostatic translation and memory formation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the precise mechanisms by which this dysregulation occurs, as well as the pathogenic consequences of this dysregulation have yet to be described. Here we establish that FTD-associated tau mutations impair protein synthesis prior to the onset of memory impairments by slowing ribosomal elongation speed, causing ribosomes to collide upon mRNAs. We reveal that this tau-induced ribosomal collision ultimately impairs memory-associated translation through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) via GCN2. Pharmacological prevention of this ISR activation not only rescues memory formation in the PS19 mouse model of FTD, but also attenuates neuronal death, decreases tau phosphorylation and accumulation, and improves survival. Collectively, our data elucidates a novel mechanism by which mRNA translation is impaired early in neurodegeneration, identifies several pathological phenotypes which are traceable to impairments in mRNA translation, and highlights the therapeutic potential of rescuing these translational impairments.

">A neural moonshine conjecture. The representation of error-correcting codes in 3D symmetries invites the prospect of a Golay in the machine.</a></h4>

              
                Conant-Ashby's ("good regulator") theorem states that a simple regulator of a system must behave as an image of it. Notably, evolutionary features present in living beings often mirror natural processes, yielding symmetries between biological structures and the external environment. For instance, nervous cells can represent abstract entities through coordinated activities of neural networks. Central pattern generators (CPGs) used in locomotion display cyclic group symmetries (e.g. Zn ), while the visual cortex and hyperbolic geometries in the hippocampus are respectively connected with Euclidean (SE(2), SE(3)) and Special linear (SL(2, R)) groups. This study renders conceivable a very efficient instance of the perfect error-correcting Golay code, whose automorphism group is the Mathieu sporadic simple group M24 . We demonstrate that a set of 24 neurons is naturally organizable in a fully symmetric 3D polygonal network that embodies corruption-resistant dynamics. The existence of this configuration in biological systems is yet to be observed.

">Modeling Time to Visual Insight in Mooney Image Recognition with a Chaotic Recurrent Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                Insight is often described as a sudden shift in or formation of a conceptual representation, enabling humans to restructure existing knowledge and solve problems beyond conventional analytical approaches. Although prior computational studies have modeled aspects of insight using deep neural networks (DNNs) or reinforcement learning, few have captured the dynamic emergence of insight through autonomous neural computation. Here, we present a neural network model that simulates the time required to reach visual insight in the Mooney image recognition task, a widely used paradigm for studying visual insight and perceptual reorganization. The model couples a DNN module for perceptual feature extraction with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that implements a chaotic search process for recognition. The RNN is formulated as a continuous-time dynamical system, autonomously explores internal states, and stabilizes when the missing visual features required for recognition are internally reconstructed. Using the same image set as in human psychophysical experiments, the model reproduces key statistical properties of human search times (STs), including (i) lognormal-like ST distributions across participants for each image, (ii) a proportional relationship between the log-scale mean and standard deviation estimated from lognormal fits across images, and (iii) discrete levels of the fitted log-scale mean across images (a proxy for image difficulty). Importantly, these properties emerge without assuming any lognormal distribution for participant-to-participant variability, whereas previous models reproduced similar signatures by positing lognormal-distributed individual differences. We further show that lognormal-like signatures can arise from exponential search dynamics when combined with both standard experimental preprocessing and finite observation windows, highlighting the need to distinguish generative mechanisms from measurement and analysis effects. Together, these results motivate a mechanistic link between chaotic neural dynamics and insight-related search and provide a computational framework for implementing insight in artificial systems.

">TMS-EEG Indices to Define Local Cortical Excitability Thresholds</a></h4>

              
                Introduction - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely employed to treat various psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, TMS protocols typically rely on generalizations, particularly in selecting stimulation intensities, leading to suboptimal and variable outcomes. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) offers a potential solution by allowing direct monitoring of stimulation effects. In this study, we investigate how features of the TMS-EEG signal change with intensity to identify thresholds implying qualitative shifts in the brain response. Methods - We stimulated eight subjects at both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with navigated TMS at 15 closely spaced intensities and measured TMS-evoked EEG responses (TMS-evoked potential, TEP) with 60 trials per intensity. TEP thresholds were identified with three methods: by selecting the intensity where the TEP peak-to-peak exceeds 6 V, or by fitting either piecewise-linear or sigmoid curves into the power spectral density (PSD) frequency components to identify nonlinear intensity behavior. Results - The identified TEP thresholds varied depending on subject, target, and identification method. In M1, the thresholds attained with the fixed-amplitude and piecewise PSD fit methods averaged around the motor threshold, and in pre-SMA around 120% of the motor threshold. The TEP thresholds yielded by the sigmoid fit method were higher in intensity, and least consistent between subjects. Conclusions - Our findings support the hypothesis that detectable changes in EEG patterns occur at specific TMS intensities. These results provide a basis for individualized stimulation dosing, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reliability. Future research should focus on refining these methods and validating their clinical applicability across diverse conditions and patient populations.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Prior EEG research has shown that during working memory, alpha (8 to 14 Hz) and theta (4 to 8 Hz) oscillations tend to form a 2:1 frequency ratio. According to the Binary Hierarchy Brain Body Oscillation Theory (BHBBOT), a recent model grounded in mathematical analysis, this cross-frequency configuration reflects enhanced connectivity between brain regions generating these rhythms. However, this prediction has not yet been empirically tested. In this study, we leveraged high density EEG, source localization and connectivity metrics derived from Information Theory (IT) and the Theory of Weakly Coupled Oscillators (TWCO) to examine whether the previously observed alpha-theta cross-frequency dynamics during working memory are accompanied by changes in connectivity. Our results show that a significant increase in the proportion of 2:1 ratios between regions generating frontal theta and parietal alpha rhythms was accompanied by relative decreases in connectivity, as revealed by both IT and TWCO metrics. Furthermore, phase synchrony between these two regions was significantly reduced during working memory and correlated negatively with behavioral performance. In conclusion, our results show that the increased occurrence of 2:1 alpha:theta cross-frequency ratios during working memory reflects functional segregation (rather than integration) and therefore directly challenges some of the predictions of the BHBBOT.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Context is crucial for interpreting emotional expressions. Behavioral work has consistently demonstrated the powerful impact of emotional context on disambiguating affective expressions within and across modalities. A theoretical framework suggests that context affects vocal emotion perception at all stages of the neural processing hierarchy, including primary auditory cortex. Using functional neuroimaging, we explored how emotional context images influence the perception of subsequently presented vocal emotional morphs taken from fear to pleasure continua. Morphs were embedded in a balanced sequence to enable the investigation of repetition suppression effects, while context images were blocked by emotion. Results revealed that emotionally congruent context-morph pairings enhanced activation in bilateral superior temporal gyri, including bilateral primary auditory cortex. In contrast, emotional incongruence activated bilateral inferior frontal gyri, regions typically associated with domain-general conflict resolution. To determine whether the activation in primary auditory cortex reflects feedforward or feedback processing, we analyzed the effects of context on adaptation to the morphs. Adaptation to vocal emotion was not differentially modulated by context type. Our findings suggest that context information is initially processed independently of the auditory signal and integrated after the adaptation stage, with contextual influences on sensory cortex mediated via feedback mechanisms.</span>

                <p>An exciting aspect of neuroscience is developing and testing hypotheses via experimentation. However, due to logistical and financial hurdles, the experiment and discovery component of neuroscience is generally lacking in classroom and outreach settings. To address this issue, here we introduce RetINaBox: a low-cost open&ndash;source electronic visual system simulator that provides users with a hands-on tool to discover how the visual system builds feature detectors. RetINaBox includes an LED array for generating visual stimuli and photodiodes that act as an array of model photoreceptors. Custom software on a Raspberry Pi computer reads out responses from model photoreceptors and allows users to control the polarity and delay of the signal transfer from model photoreceptors to model retinal ganglion cells. Interactive lesson plans are provided, guiding users to discover different types of visual feature detectors&mdash;including ON/OFF, center-surround, orientation-selective, and direction-selective receptive fields&mdash;as well as their underlying circuit computations.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are neuropsychiatric conditions that manifest early in life with a wide range of phenotypes, including repetitive behavior, agitation, and anxiety (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">American Psychological Association, 2013</cross-ref>). While the etiology of these disorders is incompletely understood, recent data implicate a role for mitochondrial dysfunction (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B38">Norkett et al., 2017</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Khaliulin et al., 2025</cross-ref>). Mitochondria translocate to intracellular compartments to support energetics and free-radical buffering; failure to achieve this localization results in cellular dysfunction (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Picard et al., 2016</cross-ref>). Mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (<I>Miro1</I>) resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates microtubule-mediated mitochondrial motility (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Fransson et al., 2003</cross-ref>). The loss of <I>MIRO1</I> is reported to contribute to the onset/progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Kay et al., 2018</cross-ref>). We have hypothesized that MIRO1 also has a role in nervous system development (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Lin-Hendel et al., 2016</cross-ref>). To test this, we ablated <I>Miro1</I> from cortical excitatory progenitors by crossing floxed <I>Miro1</I> mice with <I>Emx1-Cre</I> mice and studied mice of both sex. We found that mitochondrial mislocalization in migrating excitatory neurons was associated with reduced brain weight, decreased cortical volume, and subtle cortical disorganization. Adult <I>Miro1</I> conditional mutants exhibit agitative-like behaviors, including decreased nesting and abnormal home cage activity. The mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior and avoided confined spaces, features that have been linked to several human behavioral disorders. Our data link MIRO1 function with mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders and implicate intracellular mitochondrial dynamics to several anxiety-like behaviors.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Focal hand dystonia (FHD) severely impairs task-specific motor control, yet the optimal surgical target for stereotactic intervention remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the precise thalamic lesion site associated with symptomatic improvement and to clarify its network connectivity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 164 patients with FHD (mean age = 42.0 years, 26.2% women) who underwent stereotactic thalamotomy of the ventral lateral thalamus. Voxel-wise probabilistic lesion mapping was applied to relate lesion locations to clinical outcomes. Structural connectivity analyses assessed fiber tracts linked to the optimal lesion site. Model performance was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation, validation in an out-of-sample cohort, and testing in reoperation cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified that lesioning the border zone between the ventralis oralis posterior (Vop) and ventralis intermedius (Vim) nuclei was associated with improvement of FHD. The predictive model achieved high accuracy in cross-validation (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.836) and performed robustly in independent validation. Connectivity analyses showed that the Vop-Vim border zone was linked to cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic afferents as well as thalamocortical projections to the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex. In contrast, lesions extending into the ventralis oralis anterior nucleus were associated with an increased risk of motor complications.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precise targeting of the Vop-Vim border maximizes clinical benefit while minimizing adverse effects in FHD thalamotomy. These findings establish the first evidence-based thalamic target for FHD, offering practical guidance for stereotactic interventions and advancing understanding of dystonia pathophysiology.

                This paper investigates the Single-Machine Scheduling Problem under a multi-criteria optimization framework with due-window constraints, a class of NP-hard problems. The research introduces a mathematical formulation that integrates three performance measures—maximum earliness, maximum tardiness, and maximum late work—into a unified scheduling model. The due date of each job is represented as a flexible time interval bounded by minimum and maximum limits, providing a more realistic representation of production and service systems. To address the complexity of the problem, several special cases are analyzed, and a set of dominance rules is proposed to identify efficient sequences that minimize computational effort while maintaining optimality. These rules extend classical sequencing principles such as the Minimum Slack Time and Earliest Due Date rules to multi-objective contexts. So, in Results and Discussion the comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed dominance-based approach provides reliable and efficient solutions consistent with those obtained by the Complete Enumeration Method (CEM), but with significantly reduced computational complexity. The theoretical contributions of this study offer a solid foundation for understanding trade-offs between different scheduling criteria within due-window environments. Practical implications arise in Just-in-Time (JIT) systems, where minimizing both early and late job completions directly impacts cost efficiency and workflow stability. Although the analysis is restricted to a deterministic single-machine setup, the proposed framework can be extended to multi-machine, stochastic, or dynamic scheduling environments. Future research may focus on developing heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to solve larger instances efficiently. Overall, the study contributes to the advancement of multi-criteria scheduling theory by combining mathematical rigor with practical relevance for real-world manufacturing and service operations.

                Sinha and Goulian demonstrate that the phosphatase SixA is critical for E. coli to survive the starvation stress of long-term stationary phase. Genetic and biochemical analyses show that this survival advantage depends on SixA-mediated dephosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, revealing a new mechanism for regulating this enzyme in bacteria.

                Graf et al. optogenetically mapped 24 inhibitory circuits formed between interneurons and postsynaptic targets within the claustrum. A computational model predicts that the spatial structure of local circuits filters claustral input, and experimental tests confirm model predictions. Claustrum filtering precisely transforms excitatory input into output to cortical and subcortical targets.

                Lee et al. show that endothelial ANGPT2 promotes blood-brain barrier breakdown and neuroinflammation in AD. In 5xFAD mice, endothelial ANGPT2 deletion reduced β-amyloid deposition and improved cognition, whereas its overexpression increased plaque burden and impaired memory, highlighting ANGPT2-TIE2 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105948">Linking complex microbial interactions and dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka–Volterra model</a></h4>

              
                The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community’s organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, that is, joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka–Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108892">Overexpression of Ssd1 and calorie restriction extend yeast replicative lifespan by preventing deleterious age-dependent iron uptake</a></h4>

              
                Overexpression of the mRNA binding protein Ssd1 extends the yeast replicative lifespan. Using microfluidics to trap and image single cells throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. The age-dependent Ssd1 foci are condensates that appear dynamically in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and their failure to resolve during mitosis coincided with the end of lifespan. Ssd1 overexpression was epistatic with calorie restriction (CR) for lifespan extension, and yeast overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR were resistant to iron supplementation-induced lifespan shortening, while their lifespans were reduced by iron chelation. The nuclear translocation of the Aft1 transcriptional regulator of the iron regulon occurred during aging in a manner that predicted remaining lifespan but was prevented by CR. Accordingly, age-dependent induction of the Fit2 and Arn1 high-affinity iron transporters within the iron regulon was reduced by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Consistent with age-dependent activation of the iron regulon, intracellular iron accumulated during aging but was prevented by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Moreover, lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression or CR was epistatic to inactivation of the iron regulon. These studies reveal that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend the yeast replicative lifespan by blocking deleterious age-dependent iron uptake, identifying novel therapeutic targets for lifespan extension and providing insight into how CR may extend the lifespan and healthspan in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104374">Chemotherapy resistance due to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is caused by abnormal lipid metabolic balance</a></h4>

              
                Invasive cancer is defined by the loss of epithelial cell traits resulting from the ectopic expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related transcription factors such as Snail. Although EMT is known to impart chemoresistance to cancer cells, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We found that Snail expression confers chemoresistance by upregulating the cholesterol efflux pump ABCA1 as a countermeasure to the excess of cytotoxic free cholesterol relative to its major interaction partner in cellular membranes, sphingomyelin. This imbalance is introduced by the transcriptional repression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin by Snail. Inhibiting esterification of cholesterol, which renders it inert, selectively suppresses growth of a xenograft model of Snail-positive kidney cancer. Our findings offer a new perspective on lipid-targeting strategies for invasive cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104808">Dilated cardiomyopathy-associated RNA-binding motif protein 20 regulates long pre-mRNAs in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Precise coordination of molecular programs and neuronal growth governs the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of neuronal circuits. RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing nonproductive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106464">A geometric shape regularity effect in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The perception and production of regular geometric shapes, a characteristic trait of human cultures since prehistory, has unknown neural mechanisms. Behavioral studies suggest that humans are attuned to discrete regularities such as symmetries and parallelism and rely on their combinations to encode regular geometric shapes in a compressed form. To identify the brain systems underlying this ability, as well as their dynamics, we collected functional MRI in both adults and 6-year-olds, and magnetoencephalography data in adults, during the perception of simple shapes such as hexagons, triangles, and quadrilaterals. The results revealed that geometric shapes, relative to other visual categories, induce a hypoactivation of ventral visual areas and an overactivation of the intraparietal and inferior temporal regions also involved in mathematical processing, whose activation is modulated by geometric regularity. While convolutional neural networks captured the early visual activity evoked by geometric shapes, they failed to account for subsequent dorsal parietal and prefrontal signals, which could only be captured by discrete geometric features or by bigger deep-learning models of vision. We propose that the perception of abstract geometric regularities engages an additional symbolic mode of visual perception.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92991">Predicting the effect of CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenome editing</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic regulation orchestrates mammalian transcription, but functional links between them remain elusive. To tackle this problem, we use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ∼0.70−0.79 for most cell types. Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together, these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, with the timing of exposure critically shaping its neural and behavioral consequences. Here, we investigated how stress during adolescence or adulthood affects neuronal activity and oscillatory dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Animals were exposed to a combined footshock and restraint stress protocol during adolescence (postnatal days [PNDs] 31 to 40) or adulthood (PNDs 65 to 74). In vivo electrophysiological recordings of putative glutamate pyramidal neurons, Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) interneurons, and local field potentials were performed 1 to 2 and 5 to 6 wk post-stress to evaluate both short- and long-term effects. Adolescent stress induced increases in pyramidal neuron firing rates and sustained elevations in interneuron burst activity that persisted into adulthood, accompanied by long-lasting reductions in mPFC gamma oscillations. These alterations point to enduring disruptions in excitatory–inhibitory balance and impaired network coordination. In contrast, adult stress produced no persistent changes in pyramidal neuron activity but caused transient increases in interneuron excitability and selective reductions in theta oscillatory power, suggesting temporary inhibitory dysfunction. These findings highlight adolescence as a critical window during which stress triggers enduring, cell-type-specific changes in cortical circuitry, whereas changes induced by adult stress are transient, potentially reflecting recovery mechanisms. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of developmental timing in determining stress outcomes, providing mechanistic insight into how adolescent stress may contribute to long-lasting cortical dysfunction and psychiatric disease risk, and informing the timing of potential preventive or therapeutic interventions.</span>

Consequently, IRF3 inhibits the transcription factor function of HIF-α and attenuates hypoxia signaling.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal Area CA2, with some exceptions, had long been neglected in in vivo studies, due largely to its small size, and in in vitro studies because of its general similarity to CA3 and CA1. Increasing evidence showing that CA2 was molecularly distinct led to the increased appreciation of CA2 as a separate region, and as such, that it likely had functions that were dissimilar from its neighboring CA subfields that were worth studying. Indeed, it was the molecules that are enriched in CA2 that provided inspiration for many of the functional studies. In this article, I provide a personal account of how I got interested in CA2 and describe how I viewed our discoveries in the context of the others in the field. As it happened, much of my earlier work on synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and visual cortex had everything to do with why I felt compelled to ask the question, “are CA2 synapses resistant to long-term potentiation?.” In fact, we are a product of our training and our environment when we are considering research directions.</p>

     alt="The Mechanosensory Subgenual Organ Complex in the Stick Insect Bacillus rossius (Phasmatodea): Neuroanatomy and Functional Morphology"/>
<p>The subgenual organ complex in orthopteroid insects consists of few mechanosensory organs. In the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i>, the subgenual organ and distal organ include ∼70 sensilla, and both organs are located in the hemolymph channel with several connections to the leg cuticle. The neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the sensory organs resemble that of other stick insects and support a shared vibrosensory function. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The subgenual organ complex is an elaborate mechanosensory complex in the insect leg containing chordotonal organs. In stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea), it includes the subgenual organ and the distal organ. This study documents the neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the subgenual organ complex in the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i> (Bacillidae: Bacillinae) by axonal tracing and micro-computed tomography. It also considers the first report on the subgenual organ complex in stick insects that reported a relatively simple organization of the sensory organ and its nerves on the basis of histological sections. Our findings show the neuroanatomy and nerve pattern of the subgenual organ complex in <i>B. rossius</i> with a subgenual organ and a distal organ. The subgenual organ is placed in the hemolymph channel. The distal organ is also located in the hemolymph channel, and it has several attachment elements, linking it to the cuticle of the tibia, the tibial tracheae, and the subgenual organ. The connections to the tibia may form an input pathway for vibrations transmitted over the cuticle, whereas the position in the hemolymph channel and the connection to the subgenual organ indicate a mechanical activation by vibrations transmitted via the hemolymph. Overall, the axonal tracing preparations document neuroanatomical details for <i>B. rossius</i> and resolve the numbers of sensilla in the sensory organs, the length of the distal organ, and confirm a single nerve branch for the subgenual organ. The data provide support for a consistent organization of the subgenual organ complex within stick insects.</p>

     alt="Changes in Action Potential Properties in the Ferret Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence"/>
<p>Ferrets have been used as a model and contributed to our scientific knowledge in multiple fields of neuroscience such as visual development, sensory processing, executive function and TBI. Here we describe the electrophysiological changes in neuronal intrinsic properties in the prefrontal cortex of the ferret during the adolescence. We described electrophysiological changes, particularly in spike frequency adaptation, in a span of 3 months.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ferrets have a gyrencephalic brain with an organization that resembles more to humans than rodents. This animal model has been used in studies of visual cortex development and plasticity, sensory processing, multisensory integration, traumatic brain injury, and decision making. Surprisingly, there is no convention of what defines adulthood in the ferret. Studies have considered ferret adulthood as early as P90 and as late as 2 years. Adolescence is a period of development characterized by physical maturation, risk-taking behavior, and impulsivity. Although physical maturation, including puberty, co-occurs with adolescence, they do not indicate when adulthood is reached. For instance, although puberty in humans is completed by 16–17 years of age, the human brain continues to mature until approximately 23–25 years of age with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturing latest. Therefore, the functional maturation of the PFC is proposed to act as a marker of the conversion between adolescence and adulthood. We conducted whole-cell patch clamp of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in Layer 5 from acute slices from the prelimbic cortex portion of ferret medial PFC at three different ages after puberty (P120, P180, and P220). Injected current-firing curves indicate that the amount of current needed to elicit the same number of action potentials (APs) increases between P120 and P220. In addition, we observed an increase in sag amplitude that was accompanied by a reduction in rheobase. Our findings show that excitability of PNs in this region changes between the ages investigated, which suggests that ferret PFC does not mature before P220.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Naturally occurring autoantibodies are commonly considered to be causative of autoimmune diseases or epiphenomena with no known biological impact. Although clinically beneficial autoantibodies have been described, there have been no naturally occurring anti-neuronal antibodies that have been found to be neuroprotective. Here, we identify a recombinant human antibody (TGM-010) derived from a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) that binds human and mouse neurons, leading to beneficial effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TGM-010 was examined for its ability to be internalized by human and mouse neurons and protect neurons from death in vitro following a stress event. TGM-010 was also injected systemically into a relapsing–remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to examine its ability to impact disease score, extent of demyelination, and neuron frequency.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TGM-010 demonstrates many novel characteristics including crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and internalizing into neurons. TGM-010 also protects primary mouse neurons from death in vitro. In a mouse model of MS, TGM-010 ameliorates disease severity and is associated with improved neuronal survival.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a patient-derived neuron-binding autoantibody that crosses the BBB in mice and reduces neuron loss in a mouse model of MS. These data suggest that the human derived anti-neuronal antibody, TGM-010, may potentially be used to ameliorate neurodegeneration that underlies disability in neurodegenerative conditions.

[version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among (Study sample 312) undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, inappropriate posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

                Background This article explored the chemical constituents of water and ethanol extracts from the whole body of A. m. jemenitica honeybee drones and workers, investigating their effects on glucose tolerance test (GTT) curves through feeding experiments conducted on Oryctolagus cuniculus male rabbits. Methods Chemical analysis of the extracts was performed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy alongside the spectral database of organic compounds. Results The water extract revealed a richer diversity of natural products (38 compounds) compared to the ethanol extract (12 compounds). Notably, the water extract comprised various bioactive molecules, including sugars and their derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, quinones, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and organometallic compounds. In contrast, the ethanol extract primarily contained sugar derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and pesticides. The water extract decreased the blood glucose level and transformed the GTT curve from a convex to a concave shape. Conclusion The blood glucose-lowering effect of the water extract may be attributed to the anti-diabetic properties of its dipeptides, phenolic compounds and alkaloid contents.

                The development of smart cities through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) has accelerated the growth of Southeast Asia’s capital and important cities. However, a growing concern has been how much the intentions of Southeast Asian cities to achieve ‘smart city status’ consider the basic elements of human rights and the provision of essential public services. The first policy recommendation is to acknowledge the vulnerability of the underprivileged, personal security, and social inclusion in governing smart cities to counter the possible derailment of democratic progress in the region. The second recommendation is to have fellow ASEAN member states assist in providing essential public services to avoid a ‘development’ model imposed by external funding stakeholders. The policy brief uses secondary data from 2018 to 2024 on the ASEAN Smart Cities Network projects and identifies civic and social concerns that arose during this period.

                Background Deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) constitute an emerging category of bioherbicides with the capacity to inhibit weed germination through phytotoxic metabolites. Aim This study aimed to isolate and screen rhizobacteria for deleterious potentials. Bacterial isolation was carried out using the standard pour plating method. Methods Five agricultural crops (cucumber, soybean, sorghum, cowpea and maize) were assayed for phytotoxic screening against the DRB. In addition, antimicrobial potential of the DRB against test pathogens and indole acetic acid (IAA) were also investigated. Polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing of the isolates revealed three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one each of P. fluorescens and E. hormaechei. Results The antimicrobial outcomes of the test DRB revealed broad-spectrum inhibition against the test pathogens. In terms of culture age, younger cultures (≤48 h) mostly stimulated or matched control germination and vigor indices with toxicity increasing progressively with age beyond 120 h for most of the seeds. In the case of steeping duration, short steeping durations (1–2 h) typically maintained germination and vigor near control levels. Progressive extension of steeping time increased inhibition across all isolates. At different inoculum concentrations, higher inoculum concentrations produced stronger inhibitory effects than diluted suspensions. Full-strength inoculum (100%) suppressed vigor drastically, whereas 20–40% dilutions produced diminished or reversible effects. Also, all isolates produced measurable IAA in tryptophan-supplemented media with output increasing with incubation age, correlating with suppression of vigor at later time points. Conclusion The indigenous origin of the DRB evaluated in this study enhances environmental compatibility and reduces ecological disturbance risks.

                Background Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB/PAS), and Giemsa stains are routinely used in the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. However, comparative data on their diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in detecting Helicobacter pylori are limited. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using H&E and AB/PAS as alternatives to Giemsa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 816 gastric biopsy cases collected between 2019 and 2021. Three slides (H&E, Giemsa, and AB/PAS) were previously prepared from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample and blindly evaluated by three independent examiners. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. Results >H&E yielded a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 74.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 66.4% when compared to Giemsa as the reference standard. In comparison, AB/PAS exhibited a sensitivity of 45.9%, specificity of 73.2%, and an accuracy of 63.7%. When evaluating operational factors, H&E emerged as the most cost-effective and fastest method, while AB/PAS was associated with higher costs and longer processing times. Overall, Giemsa consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic performance across the assessed metrics, positioning it as the more reliable choice for H. pylori detection within this comparative framework. Conclusions H&E shows potential for initial screening but its limited sensitivity prevents definitive diagnosis. AB/PAS proved less effective and economical. Giemsa maintained superior diagnostic performance. This study provides a comparative methodological assessment, suggesting H&E and Giemsa combinations could enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. Further prospective validation is needed before clinical implementation.

                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open-fire system that consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased from a neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients and appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, modified stove, and a combination of modified stove and double-pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring its refractive index and specific gravity. The sensory evaluation of areke samples was conducted by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The highest ethanol concentration in areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double-pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored as excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All judges agreed that traditional and double-pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double-pipe distillation with a modified stove had better performance than traditional areke distillation.

                <p>Bimanual coordination, fundamental to human motor control, typically involves the execution of different functions by the two limbs (e.g., opening a jar). Previous research has largely investigated bimanual control through simple coordination tasks in which the limbs perform similar movements (e.g., finger tapping); however, few studies have specifically examined coordination when the two limbs perform different yet complementary functions. In the current study, participants performed point-to-point movements of a rectangular cursor, where one limb controlled cursor trajectory and the other rotated a knob to match a target orientation. Participants (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female, 1 nonbinary; 92% right-handed) were divided into four groups and completed the task with a visual feedback gain perturbation (an increase or decrease) applied either to the cursor trajectory or orientation. Our results showed rapid adaptation to perturbations of visual feedback of the movement trajectory, affecting both the perturbed limb controlling the trajectory and the unperturbed limb controlling the orientation. Conversely, perturbation to the visual orientation feedback primarily only influenced the perturbed limb controlling orientation, with minimal impact on movement trajectory metrics. Importantly, these results were independent of reaching amplitude, duration, and limb dominance. In addition, we assessed the temporal coordination between the two limbs and found that perturbations in visual trajectory feedback led to significant changes in limb coordination, whereas no notable difference was observed for perturbations of orientation. These findings indicate asymmetries in bimanual motor recalibration dependent on the perturbed aspect of visual feedback (orientation vs trajectory), suggesting differences in underlying neural mechanisms and interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Alpha peak frequency (APF) is defined as a prominent spectral peak within the 8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz frequency range. Typically, an individual's alpha frequency is regarded as a stable neurophysiological marker. A wealth of recent evidence, however, indicates that APF shifts within short timescales in relation to task demands and even spontaneously so. Further, brain stimulation studies often report shifts in APF both within and between experimental sessions, directly contradicting the idea of a stable APF. To characterize the nonstationarities in spectral parameters, we estimated APFs from 1&nbsp;s epochs of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from healthy adults of either sex. To enhance signal-to-noise ratio, without compromising on temporal resolution, we averaged power spectra within parcelled regions. Our findings indicate that variation in APFs exacerbates along the posterior-to-anterior cortical plane, i.e., from the occipital to the frontal cortices. Further, by comparisons with amplitude-matched simulated signals, we demonstrated that the observed gradient is not attributable to measurement noise. Across the cortex, APFs showed poor temporal reliability, raising the question of whether APFs are more like a transient state than a trait. In general, our study elucidates the dynamic characteristics of alpha oscillations and reveals systematic regional differences which are, in part, shaped by underlying signal-to-noise ratio inherent to MEG recordings.</p>

     alt="The Subcellular Localization of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator in the Chicken Retina Suggests Multiple Roles in Retinal Function"/>
<p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has widespread expression in the avian retina. Immuno-electron microscopy reveals its localization to synapses in the inner plexiform layer. In vitro pharmacological inhibition of CFTR increases spontaneous quantal event frequency. Thus, CFTR activity is linked to synaptic transmission in retinal neurons.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Protein function is influenced by multiple factors including cell type and subcellular localization. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is well investigated in epithelial tissues, where life threatening symptoms stem from its dysfunction. A postsynaptic neuronal role was previously established by the Gleason lab where CFTR regulation of cytosolic Cl<sup>–</sup> in retinal amacrine cells was shown. Other work from our lab showed that disruption of the synaptic vesicle cycle reduced action of CFTR, suggesting CFTR associates with synaptic vesicles. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that CFTR localizes to the synapse with possible presynaptic function. To address this, the cellular and subcellular CFTR localization in mature chicken retina was examined using fluorescence light microscopy and immunogold-labeled transmission electron microscopy. CFTR labeling was detected throughout the retina, including photoreceptor outer segments and in the mitochondria rich region of the photoreceptor inner segment termed the ellipsoid. Synaptic labeling was found in both synaptic plexiform layers, pre-and post-synaptically. A subset of amacrine cells were strongly labeled and labeling was also found in Müller cells and in axons of the nerve fiber layer. Addressing whether the activity of CFTR plays a role in presynaptic function, amacrine cells were recorded using the whole cell voltage clamp method. Spontaneous postsynaptic quantal currents were recorded and found to increase in frequency upon pharmacological inhibition of CFTR suggesting that under normal circumstances, CFTR serves to limit the rate of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion. This work provides evidence CFTR might have multiple functions in the retina including synaptic transmission regulation.</p>

     alt="Myelitis-Predominant Aggressive Phenotype: Unveiling Unique Patterns of Late-Onset Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare clinical features and prognosis of late-onset neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (LO-NMOSD, onset age ≥60 years) with adult-onset NMOSD (AO-NMOSD, onset age 18–59 years), and to provide insights for individualized management in elderly patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 748 patients with NMOSD (diagnosed according to the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria) in the China National Registry of Neuro-Inflammatory Diseases (CNRID) were analyzed. Patients were stratified into AO-NMOSD (18–59 years, n = 617) and LO-NMOSD (≥ 60 years, n = 131). Demographics, clinical manifestations, imaging, treatments, and outcomes were compared using appropriate statistical methods including Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD showed distinct traits: a lower female predominance (76.34% vs 86.55%), higher transverse myelitis (TM) incidence at onset (57.36% vs 40.17%), elevated annualized relapse rate (ARR; 0.52 ± 0.03 vs 0.38 ± 0.01), and accelerated disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 4.75 vs 3.0). TM-predominant relapses (39 of 45, 86.67% in LO vs 96 of 148, 64.86% in AO) contributed significantly to disability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed LO-NMOSD had a higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.932, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.427–2.615), disability (HR = 3.192, 95% CI = 1.932–5.274) and reaching visual acuity (VA) ≤20 of 30 (HR = 3.523, 95% CI = 1.585–7.828). Cox regression confirmed that onset age ≥60 years was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.60–2.59), disability (HR = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.14–4.62), and reaching VA ≤20 of 30 (HR 3.26, 95% CI = 1.83–5.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD is characterized by myelitis-predominance with recurrent spinal cord involvement, high risk of relapses, and severe disability. It thus underscores the need for heightened clinical attention, with rigorous monitoring that balance safety and efficacy for elderly patients with NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo mutations in the syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1), encoded by <i>STXBP1</i>, are among the most prevalent causes of variable neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, and movement disorders. Although STXBP1 has been proposed as a critical presynaptic protein controlling synaptic vesicle exocytosis, clinical phenotypes also suggest that its biological function could be more diverse.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The expression pattern of STXBP1 was studied using immunostaining <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Synaptosome isolation was performed to investigate the synaptic and non-synaptic localization of STXBP1 in the brain. STXBP1 immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS) was conducted to identify protein complexes interacting with STXBP1. Cre-in utero electroporation (IUE) was done on <i>Stxbp1</i>
<sup>F/F</sup> mice to generate an <i>in vivo</i> knockout (KO) cellular model for studying the <i>in vivo</i> function of STXBP1.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that STXBP1 expression in the cerebral cortex was developmentally regulated and was detected in neuronal soma and processes. STXBP1 was in both the synaptic and cytosolic fractions, interacting with neuronal cytoskeleton and membrane periodic structures. Interestingly, sparse <i>Stxbp1</i> KO in the mouse forebrain led to cell-autonomous cell death, which was rescued by either wild-type STXBP1 or pathogenic mutants. However, <i>Stxbp1</i> KO neurons rescued by pathogenic mutants exhibited impaired dendritic growth. Our results also showed that STXBP1 interacted with alpha II Spectrin and ARPC2 and is required for their localization on the neuronal membrane.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest that STXBP1 has diverse functions in the nervous system and regulates the trafficking of membrane cytoskeleton proteins in the brain. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence linking modifiable risk factors to age-related brain diseases, such as dementia, stroke, and depression (DSD), is robust, yet limited regarding long-term change in modifiable risk factors in association with these conditions, particularly in real-world settings. This study aimed to assess whether longitudinal changes in modifiable brain health risk factors were associated with reduced risk of DSD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed UK Biobank data (2006–2019) from 155,469 participants with general practitioner-linked data. The Brain Care Score (BCS) assesses 12 modifiable risk factors across lifestyle, physical, and social–emotional domains. Longitudinal BCS measurements were derived from repeated general practitioner (GP)-recorded measurements. Changes in the BCS were modeled using linear mixed-effects models, and associations with DSD were evaluated using multivariable Cox models, adjusting for baseline BCS and genetic risk (polygenic risk scores for stroke and depression, and <i>APOE</i> genotype for dementia).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 155,469 participants (median age = 51 years, 54.3% women), the median annual BCS change was 0.14 (Q1–Q3 = 0.008–0.30) points over a median follow-up of 12.3 years (Q1–Q3 = 11.5–13.1 years). Over time, 82.1% improved their BCS, 12.9% remained stable, and 5.0% worsened over time. Each 1-point annual increase in the BCS was associated with 4% lower risk of incident age-related brain diseases (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this large real-world cohort, improvements in modifiable risk factor profiles were associated with lower incidence of DSD, regardless of genetic risk or baseline BCS. Our results provide important information for communicating with patients about the brain health benefits of improving risk factor profiles. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background Academic integrity is presented as a complex, multidimensional concept that involves all members of an educational institution. However, non-teaching staff members are often excluded from research on academic integrity. I engaged in professional support alongside academic staff to explore how academic integrity is understood within the Mauritius branch of a UK higher education institution. Methods I adopted a qualitative approach to engage those tasked with implementing academic integrity to examine how they understood and practised it. Data were gathered through face-to-face focus-group interviews, which were translated into themes. Results This article identified the factors that make academic integrity challenging and presents recommendations for practitioners and researchers. Conclusions More energy should be invested in the processes that build cultures of integrity rather than focusing on the opposite, such as cheating, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic integrity is ultimately a positive values-driven approach to learning and a skill that can be developed and strengthened.

                Background The study of algebraic structures through graph-theoretic representations provides a powerful visual and combinatorial framework for analyzing ring-theoretic properties. The ideal-based non-zero divisor graph ∅ I ( Z n ) , constructed from the ring of integers modulo n with respect to a proper ideal I . This graph extends the classical zero-divisor graph framework and serves as a visual and structural invariant for analyzing ideal interactions in finite commutative rings. Methods Using combinatorial graph theory and modular arithmetic, we analyze fundamental properties of ∅ I ( Z n ) . Vertex degrees, connectivity, and cut-sets are characterized using divisibility conditions and the Euler totient function ϕ ( n ) . The analysis distinguishes cases based on the parity and primality of n , as well as the generator of I . Topological indices, including the Zagreb and Randić indices, are formulated to quantify structural complexity. Results We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the connectivity of ∅ I ( Z n ) , proving it is connected for all n ≥ 10 and any non-zero proper ideal I . For prime n ∉ { 2 , 3 } , the graph is shown to be complete. General formulas are provided for calculating vertex degrees based on gcd ( x , d ) where I = < d > . Furthermore, the structure and computation cut-sets are characterized for Z p 2 and composite n = xy . Moreover, the domination number γ ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=1 and girth gr ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=3 is established for n ≥ 10 . General expressions for Zagreb and Randić indices are derived, directly linking graph invariants to n and d . Conclusions The graph ∅ I ( Z n ) serves as an effective combinatorial invariant for studying the interplay between ideals and zero-divisor structure in Z n . These results establish systematic connections between ring-theoretic properties and graph parameters, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis through connectivity, degree distributions, cut-sets, and topological indices.

                Recognizing and appreciating the diversity of people around the world is a necessary step in achieving equality for all. The opening of equitable chances for society as a whole is one of the ways in which libraries contribute to the reduction of the exclusion gap. Despite their expanding relevance, institutions like libraries demonstrate inconsistent patterns of integration and research. This literature analysis aimed to examine the methods employed by public libraries to foster social inclusion across various populations from 2014 to 2024. A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying n = 69 interventions that fulfilled the inclusion criteria according to PRISMA methodological principles. The findings indicate a necessity for collaboration between libraries and other organizations to enhance their effectiveness in promoting social inclusion. The findings underscore the necessity of adopting a comprehensive perspective on inclusion in libraries, which encompasses an examination of infrastructure and participation in physical spaces, as well as additional aspects and dimensions, integrating both physical and digital inclusion.

                Background Female teachers working in conflict and displacement settings are both crisis survivors and crisis responders, nurturing learning, stability, and hope and experiencing trauma, economic insecurity and systemic neglect. Their lived experiences and coping systems remain under-documented and undervalued. This review is a synthesis of multi-regional findings to shed light on the interaction of gender, precarity, and resilience on the development of professional and psychosocial pathways of women teachers during and after conflict. Methods This narrative systematic review was done using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Thirty-four primary studies and several secondary sources in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe were reviewed. Results Female teachers were subjected to the greatest instability and trauma, with post-traumatic stress (22-35%), burnout (40-70%), and acute psychological distress (over 70% under active crises) being the most prominent. The chronic attrition and “brain waste” were caused by structural deprivation in the form of salary arrears, invalidation of credential, and exclusion to continuous professional development (CPD). Relational and spiritual resilience were found to be strong buffers despite these limitations. Burnout was reduced by peer networks, faith-based coping and community support and agency was restored. Online and physical CPD programs in Kakuma, Lebanon and Ukraine assisted displaced women to maintain teaching identity and re-credential after displacement. Teacher Stability Index (TSI) showed that there was universal low interdependence resilience (0.50). Conclusion Women educators in conflict and displacement situations represent paradox: they perpetuate the educational process and survive the trauma and structural marginalization. It would take systematic reform to identify them as professionals in humanitarian work, rather than as a fringe volunteer. Some of the priority interventions are listed as the stabilization of salaries, transnational credential recognition, survivor-focused protection against GBV, and the scaling of culturally grounded and peer-based resilience networks.

                Background Tuberculosis with co-morbid diabetes mellitus presents a substantial public health challenge, necessitating immediate and coordinated interventions. Such interventions should be sustainable and have a high acceptance rate in real-world settings. Applying the principles of implementation science is essential to enhance the existing system. This research study aims to assess the influence of innovation characteristics on the implementation of an Optimised TB-diabetes integrated care package. Objectives The main objectives of this study are to explore the perceptions and experiences of intervention developers; to understand the experiences of health professionals and patients regarding the Opt TBD integrated care package; assess the content validity of the innovation characteristics instrument; and evaluate the influence of intervention characteristics on the implementation process of the Opt TBD integrated care package. Methods The study will be conducted at thirteen selected TB healthcare facilities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab over a period of 18 months, in three phases. Evaluation will involve qualitative exploration of intervention development, followed by feasibility testing, and finally the definitive implementation of the intervention. The participants will include key stakeholders: intervention developers, TB health professionals, and patients. Conclusion This study will generate critical insights for the Opt TBD integrated care package, focusing on enhancing contextual relevance and improving adoption rates in practical, real-world settings. Specifically, this research study seeks to identify key implementation challenges, evaluate the fidelity of the intervention, and validate the causal relationships between the characteristics of the innovation and its implementation success.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories/hostels, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Food habits at campus differ substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize a model and understand university students’ food choices, utilizing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students from technical and health science programs at a private university in Udupi, who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The model illustrated the duration of students’ campus residence, provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, recommendation to display nutritional information in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation offers valuable insights into the role of UDF in providing nutritionally balanced meals to students, which may contribute to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.
