	<p>Scarcity goods have generally been perceived as high in value in real-world and empirical studies. However, few studies have investigated this value over time, such as performance in intertemporal decision making. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s chief objective was to determine how scarcity evaluation changes temporally. We used the electroencephalogram technique and an outcome evaluation task with the valuation of scarcity and ordinary rewards delivered at different times to explore the effect of scarcity on delay discounting. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) results show that ordinary goods were associated with a more negative amplitude than scarcity goods, and that rewards delivered in the future evoked more negative deflection compared to those delivered immediately. The prominent FRN effect was derived mainly from ordinary trials rather than scarcity trials in the immediate condition and in the future rather than only in the immediate condition. The Frontal Asymmetry Index (FAI) results show that the scarcity condition was associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activity than the ordinary condition when delivered immediately. The frontal asymmetry indicated greater approach motivation. Our electrophysiology data indicate that scarcity goods have a perceived high value, particularly when delivered immediately.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conditional Degradation of UNC-31/CAPS Enables Spatiotemporal Analysis of Neuropeptide Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in <I>C. elegans</I> including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs, and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 postembryonically from the hermaphrodite nervous system and revealed defects in egg laying, locomotion, and vesicle release that were comparable to those in <I>unc-31</I> null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal behavior and physiology is controlled by neuropeptides that are released from specific neuronal sources. The ability to dissect discrete neuropeptide functions requires precise manipulation of neuropeptide release. We have developed and validated a tool that enables precise spatiotemporal regulation of neuropeptide release that will enable researchers to examine neuropeptide function at exceptional resolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictable Fluctuations in Excitatory Synaptic Strength Due to Natural Variation in Presynaptic Firing Rate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many controlled <I>in vitro</I> studies have demonstrated how postsynaptic responses to presynaptic spikes are not constant but depend on short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) and the detailed timing of presynaptic spikes. However, the effects of short-term plasticity (depression and facilitation) are not limited to short, subsecond timescales. The effects of STP appear on long timescales as changes in presynaptic firing rates lead to changes in steady-state synaptic transmission. Here, we examine the relationship between natural variations in the presynaptic firing rates and spike transmission <I>in vivo</I>. Using large-scale spike recordings in awake male and female mice from the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset, we first detect putative excitatory synaptic connections based on cross-correlations between the spike trains of millions of pairs of neurons. For the subset of pairs where a transient, excitatory effect was detected, we use a model-based approach to track fluctuations in synaptic efficacy and find that efficacy varies substantially on slow (~1 min) timescales over the course of these recordings. For many connections, the efficacy fluctuations are correlated with fluctuations in the presynaptic firing rate. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, we then model the detailed probability of postsynaptic spiking on a millisecond timescale, including both slow changes in postsynaptic excitability and monosynaptic inputs with short-term plasticity. The detailed model reproduces the slow efficacy fluctuations observed with many putative excitatory connections, suggesting that these fluctuations can be both directly predicted based on the time-varying presynaptic firing rate and, at least partly, explained by the cumulative effects of STP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The firing rates of individual neurons naturally vary because of stimuli, movement, and brain state. Models of synaptic transmission predict that these variations in firing rates should be accompanied by slow fluctuations in synaptic strength because of short-term depression and facilitation. Here, we characterize the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in synaptic strength <I>in vivo</I> using large-scale spike recordings. For putative excitatory connections from a wide range of brain areas, we find that typical synaptic efficacy varies as much as ~70%, and in many cases the fluctuations are well described by models of short-term synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the dynamic nature of <I>in vivo</I> synaptic transmission and the interplay between synaptic strength and firing rates in awake animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nonsynaptic Transmission Mediates Light Context-Dependent Odor Responses in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent connectome analyses of the entire synaptic circuit in the nervous system have provided tremendous insights into how neural processing occurs through the synaptic relay of neural information. Conversely, the extent to which ephaptic transmission which does not depend on the synapses contributes to the relay of neural information, especially beyond a distance between adjacent neurons and to neural processing remains unclear. We show that ephaptic transmission mediated by extracellular potential changes in female <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> can reach &gt;200 &micro;m, equivalent to the depth of its brain. Furthermore, ephaptic transmission driven by retinal photoreceptor cells mediates light-evoked firing rate increases in olfactory sensory neurons. These results indicate that ephaptic transmission contributes to sensory responses that can change momentarily in a context-dependent manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although extracellular field potential activities are commonly observed in many nervous systems, this activity has been generally considered as a side effect of synchronized spiking of neurons. This study, however, shows that field potential changes in retinae evoked by a sensory stimulus can control the excitability of distant neurons <I>in vivo</I> and mediates multimodal sensory integration in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. As such ephaptic transmission is more effective at a short distance, the ephaptic transmission from the retinae may contribute significantly to firing rate changes in downstream neurons of the photoreceptor cells in the optic lobe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Variability of the Surface Area of the V1, V2, and V3 Maps in a Large Sample of Human Observers</a></h4>

              
                <p>How variable is the functionally defined structure of early visual areas in human cortex and how much variability is shared between twins? Here we quantify individual differences in the best understood functionally defined regions of cortex: V1, V2, V3. The Human Connectome Project 7T Retinotopy Dataset includes retinotopic measurements from 181 subjects (109 female, 72 male), including many twins. We trained four "anatomists" to manually define V1-V3 using retinotopic features. These definitions were more accurate than automated anatomical templates and showed that surface areas for these maps varied more than threefold across individuals. This threefold variation was little changed when normalizing visual area size by the surface area of the entire cerebral cortex. In addition to varying in size, we find that visual areas vary in how they sample the visual field. Specifically, the cortical magnification function differed substantially among individuals, with the relative amount of cortex devoted to central vision varying by more than a factor of 2. To complement the variability analysis, we examined the similarity of visual area size and structure across twins. Whereas the twin sample sizes are too small to make precise heritability estimates (50 monozygotic pairs, 34 dizygotic pairs), they nonetheless reveal high correlations, consistent with strong effects of the combination of shared genes and environment on visual area size. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive account of individual variability in visual area structure to date, and provide a robust population benchmark against which new individuals and developmental and clinical populations can be compared.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Areas V1, V2, and V3 are among the best studied functionally defined regions in human cortex. Using the largest retinotopy dataset to date, we characterized the variability of these regions across individuals and the similarity between twin pairs. We find that the size of visual areas varies dramatically (up to 3.5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>) across healthy young adults, far more than the variability of the cerebral cortex size as a whole. Much of this variability appears to arise from inherited factors, as we find very high correlations in visual area size between monozygotic twin pairs, and lower but still substantial correlations between dizygotic twin pairs. These results provide the most comprehensive assessment of how functionally defined visual cortex varies across the population to date.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tunable Action Potential Repolarization Governed by Kv3.4 Channels in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Kv3.4 channel regulates action potential (AP) repolarization in nociceptors and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. We hypothesize that this is a tunable role governed by protein kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv3.4 cytoplasmic N-terminal inactivation domain (NTID) at four nonequivalent sites. However, there is a paucity of causation evidence linking the phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 to the properties of the AP. To establish this link, we used adeno-associated viral vectors to specifically manipulate the expression and the effective phosphorylation status of Kv3.4 in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from mixed-sex rat embryos at embryonic day 18. These vectors encoded GFP (background control), wild-type (WT) Kv3.4, phosphonull (PN) Kv3.4 mutant (PN = S[8,9,15,21]A), phosphomimic (PM) Kv3.4 mutant (PM = S[8,9,15,21]D), and a Kv3.4 nonconducting dominant-negative (DN) pore mutant (DN = W429F). Following viral infection of the DRG neurons, we evaluated transduction efficiency and Kv3.4 expression and function via fluorescence microscopy and patch clamping. All functional Kv3.4 constructs induced current overexpression with similar voltage dependence of activation. However, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN induced fast transient currents, the Kv3.4-PM induced currents exhibiting impaired inactivation. In contrast, the Kv3.4-DN abolished the endogenous Kv3.4 current. Consequently, Kv3.4-DN and Kv3.4-PM produced APs with the longest and shortest durations, respectively, whereas Kv3.4-WT and Kv3.4-PN produced intermediate results. Moreover, the AP widths and maximum rates of AP repolarization from these groups are negatively correlated. We conclude that the expression and effective phosphorylation status of the Kv3.4 NTID confer a tunable mechanism of AP repolarization, which may provide exquisite regulation of pain signaling in DRG neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The AP is an all-or-none millisecond-long electrical impulse that encodes information in the frequency and patterns of repetitive firing. However, signaling may also depend on the plasticity and diversity of the AP waveform. For instance, the shape and duration of the AP may regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission between a primary sensory afferent to a secondary neuron in the spinal cord. Here, we used mutants of the Kv3.4 voltage-gated potassium channel to manipulate its expression and effective phosphorylation status in dorsal root ganglion neurons and directly show how the expression and malleable inactivation properties of Kv3.4 govern the AP duration and repolarization rate. These results elucidate a mechanism of neural AP plasticity that may regulate pain signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Active Licking Shapes Cortical Taste Coding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from &gt;500 single GC neurons in male and female mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing or phase relative to licks. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish among tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons represent information from the outside world via changes in their number of action potentials (spikes) over time. This study examines how neurons in the mouse gustatory cortex (GC) encode taste information when gustatory stimuli are experienced through the active process of licking. We use electrophysiological recordings and data analysis tools to evaluate the ability of GC neurons to distinguish tastants and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing relative to licks. We show that the neuron's ability to distinguish between tastes is higher when spike rate and timing are interpreted relative to the timing of licks, indicating that the lick cycle is a key factor for taste processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Subcellular Distribution and Release Dynamics of Cotransmitted Cholinergic and GABAergic Synaptic Inputs Modify Dopaminergic Neuronal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>We identified three types of monosynaptic cholinergic inputs spatially arranged onto medial substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in male and female mice: cotransmitted acetylcholine (ACh)/GABA, GABA-only, and ACh only. There was a predominant GABA-only conductance along lateral dendrites and soma-centered ACh/GABA cotransmission. In response to repeated stimulation, the GABA conductance found on lateral dendrites decremented less than the proximally located GABA conductance, and was more effective at inhibiting action potentials. While soma-localized ACh/GABA cotransmission showed depression of the GABA component with repeated stimulation, ACh-mediated nicotinic responses were largely maintained. We investigated whether this differential change in inhibitory/excitatory inputs leads to altered neuronal excitability. We found that a depolarizing current or glutamate preceded by cotransmitted ACh/GABA was more effective in eliciting an action potential compared with current, glutamate, or ACh/GABA alone. This enhanced excitability was abolished with nicotinic receptor inhibitors, and modulated by T- and L-type calcium channels, thus establishing that activity of multiple classes of ion channels integrates to shape neuronal excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our laboratory has previously discovered a population of substantia nigra dopaminegic neurons (DA) that receive cotransmitted ACh and GABA. This study used subcellular optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic presynaptic terminals to map the functional ACh and GABA synaptic inputs across the somatodendritic extent of substantia nigra DA neurons. We determined spatially clustered GABA-only inputs on the lateral dendrites while cotransmitted ACh and GABA clustered close to the soma. We have shown that the action of GABA and ACh in cotransmission spatially clustered near the soma play a critical role in enhancing glutamate-mediated neuronal excitability through the activation of T- and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Intraregional and Interregional Heterogeneity between Myenteric Glial Cells of the Colon and Duodenum in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Enteric glia are a unique population of peripheral neuroglia that regulate homeostasis in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and intestinal functions. Despite existing in functionally diverse regions of the gastrointestinal tract, enteric glia have been approached scientifically as a homogeneous group of cells. This assumption is at odds with the functional specializations of gastrointestinal organs and recent data suggesting glial heterogeneity in the brain and ENS. Here, we used calcium imaging in transgenic mice of both sexes expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors in enteric glia and conducted contractility studies to investigate functional diversity among myenteric glia in two functionally distinct intestinal organs: the duodenum and the colon. Our data show that myenteric glia exhibit regionally distinct responses to neuromodulators that require intercellular communication with neurons to differing extents in the duodenum and colon. Glia regulate intestinal contractility in a region-specific and pathway-specific manner, which suggests regionally diverse engagement of enteric glia in local motor patterns through discrete signaling pathways. Further, functional response profiles delineate four unique subpopulations among myenteric glia that are differentially distributed between the colon and duodenum. Our findings support the conclusion that myenteric glia exhibit both intraregional and interregional heterogeneity that contributes to region-specific mechanisms that regulate digestive functions. Glial heterogeneity adds an unexpected layer of complexity in peripheral neurocircuits, and understanding the specific functions of specialized glial subtypes will provide new insight into ENS physiology and pathophysiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Enteric glia modulate gastrointestinal functions through intercellular communication with enteric neurons. Whether heterogeneity exists among neuron&ndash;glia interactions in the digestive tract is not understood. Here, we show that myenteric glia display regional heterogeneity in their responses to neuromodulators in the duodenum and the colon, which are functionally distinct organs. Glial-mediated control of intestinal motility is region and pathway specific. Four myenteric glial subtypes are present within a given gut region that are differently distributed between gut regions. These data provide functional and regional insights into enteric circuit specificity in the adult enteric nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attentional Enhancement of Tracked Stimuli in Early Visual Cortex Has Limited Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Keeping track of the location of multiple moving objects is one of the well documented functions of visual attention. However, the mechanism of attentional selection that supports such continuous tracking is unclear. In particular, it has been proposed that target selection in early visual cortex occurs in parallel, with tracking errors arising because of attentional limitations at later processing stages. Here, we examine whether, instead, total attentional capacity for enhancement of early visual processing of tracked targets is shared between all attended stimuli. If the magnitude of attentional facilitation of multiple tracked targets was a key limiting factor of tracking ability, then one should expect it to drop systematically with increasing set-size of tracked targets. Human observers (male and female) were instructed to track two, four, or six moving objects among a pool of identical distractors. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded during the tracking period revealed that the processing of tracked targets was consistently amplified compared with the processing of the distractors. The magnitude of this amplification decreased with increasing set size, and at lateral occipital electrodes it closely followed inverse proportionality to the number of tracked items, suggesting that limited attentional resources must be shared among the tracked stimuli. Accordingly, the magnitude of attentional facilitation predicted the behavioral outcome at the end of the trial. Together, these findings demonstrate that the limitations of multiple object tracking (MOT) across set-sizes stem from the limitations of top-down selective attention already at the early stages of visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to selectively attend to relevant features or objects is the key to flexibility of perception and action in the continuously changing environment. This ability is demonstrated in the multiple object tracking (MOT) task where observers monitor multiple independently moving objects at different locations in the visual field. The role of early attentional enhancement in tracking was previously acknowledged in the literature, however, the limitations on tracking were thought to arise during later stages of processing. Here, we demonstrate that the strength of attentional facilitation depends on the number of tracked objects and predicts successful tracking performance. Thus, it is the limitations of attentional enhancement at the early stages of visual processing that determine behavioral performance limits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Social Play Behavior Is Critical for the Development of Prefrontal Inhibitory Synapses and Cognitive Flexibility in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory driven activity during early life is critical for setting up the proper connectivity of the sensory cortices. We ask here whether social play behavior, a particular form of social interaction that is highly abundant during postweaning development, is equally important for setting up connections in the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). Young male rats were deprived from social play with peers during the period in life when social play behavior normally peaks [postnatal day 21&ndash;42] (SPD rats), followed by resocialization until adulthood. We recorded synaptic currents in layer 5 cells in slices from medial PFC of adult SPD and control rats and observed that inhibitory synaptic currents were reduced in SPD slices, while excitatory synaptic currents were unaffected. This was associated with a decrease in perisomatic inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin-positive GABAergic cells. In parallel experiments, adult SPD rats achieved more reversals in a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task, which depends on the integrity of the PFC, by using a more simplified cognitive strategy than controls. Interestingly, we observed that one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the behavioral performance in the PRL, but did not prevent the decrease in PFC inhibitory synaptic inputs. Our data demonstrate the importance of unrestricted social play for the development of inhibitory synapses in the PFC and cognitive skills in adulthood and show that specific synaptic alterations in the PFC can result in a complex behavioral outcome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study addressed the question whether social play behavior in juvenile rats contributes to functional development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that rats that had been deprived from juvenile social play (social play deprivation - SPD) showed a reduction in inhibitory synapses in the PFC and a simplified strategy to solve a complex behavioral task in adulthood. Providing one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the cognitive skills in these rats, but did not prevent the reduction in PFC inhibitory synapses. Our results demonstrate a key role for unrestricted juvenile social play in PFC development and emphasize the complex relation between PFC circuit connectivity and cognitive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory Target Detection at Local and Global Timescales Reveals a Hierarchy of Supramodal Dynamics in the Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>To ensure survival in a dynamic environment, the human neocortex monitors input streams from different sensory organs for important sensory events. Which principles govern whether different senses share common or modality-specific brain networks for sensory target detection? We examined whether complex targets evoke sustained supramodal activity while simple targets rely on modality-specific networks with short-lived supramodal contributions. In a series of hierarchical multisensory target detection studies (<I>n</I> = 77, of either sex) using EEG, we applied a temporal cross-decoding approach to dissociate supramodal and modality-specific cortical dynamics elicited by rule-based global and feature-based local sensory deviations within and between the visual, somatosensory, and auditory modality. Our data show that each sense implements a cortical hierarchy orchestrating supramodal target detection responses, which operate at local and global timescales in successive processing stages. Across different sensory modalities, simple feature-based sensory deviations presented in temporal vicinity to a monotonous input stream triggered a mismatch negativity-like local signal which decayed quickly and early, whereas complex rule-based targets tracked across time evoked a P3b-like global neural response which generalized across a late time window. Converging results from temporal cross-modality decoding analyses across different datasets, we reveal that global neural responses are sustained in a supramodal higher-order network, whereas local neural responses canonically thought to rely on modality-specific regions evolve into short-lived supramodal activity. Together, our findings demonstrate that cortical organization largely follows a gradient in which short-lived modality-specific as well as supramodal processes dominate local responses, whereas higher-order processes encode temporally extended abstract supramodal information fed forward from modality-specific cortices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Each sense supports a cortical hierarchy of processes tracking deviant sensory events at multiple timescales. Conflicting evidence produced a lively debate around which of these processes are supramodal. Here, we manipulated the temporal complexity of auditory, tactile, and visual targets to determine whether cortical local and global ERP responses to sensory targets share cortical dynamics between the senses. Using temporal cross-decoding, we found that temporally complex targets elicit a supramodal sustained response. Conversely, local responses to temporally confined targets typically considered modality-specific rely on early short-lived supramodal activation. Our finding provides evidence for a supramodal gradient supporting sensory target detection in the cortex, with implications for multiple fields in which these responses are studied (e.g., predictive coding, consciousness, and attention).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit Integrity Is Related to Mnemonic Discrimination and Amyloid-{beta} Pathology in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mnemonic discrimination, a cognitive process that relies on hippocampal pattern separation, is one of the first memory domains to decline in aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We tested whether functional connectivity (FC) within the entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit, measured with high-resolution resting state fMRI, is associated with mnemonic discrimination and amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) pathology in a sample of 64 cognitively normal human older adults (mean age, 71.3 &plusmn; 6.4 years; 67% female). FC was measured between entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit nodes with known anatomical connectivity, as well as within cortical memory networks. A&beta; pathology was measured with <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir-PET, and neurodegeneration was assessed with subregional volume from structural MRI. Participants performed both object and spatial versions of a mnemonic discrimination task outside of the scanner and were classified into low-performing and high-performing groups on each task using a median split. Low object mnemonic discrimination performance was specifically associated with increased FC between anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alEC) and dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3, supporting the importance of this connection to object memory. This hyperconnectivity between alEC and DG/CA3 was related to A&beta; pathology and decreased entorhinal cortex volume. In contrast, spatial mnemonic discrimination was not associated with altered FC. A&beta; was further associated with dysfunction within hippocampal subfields, particularly with decreased FC between CA1 and subiculum as well as reduced volume in these regions. Our findings suggest that A&beta; may indirectly lead to memory impairment through entorhinal&ndash;hippocampal circuit dysfunction and neurodegeneration and provide a mechanism for increased vulnerability of object mnemonic discrimination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mnemonic discrimination is a critical episodic memory process that is performed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, relying on input from entorhinal cortex. Mnemonic discrimination is particularly vulnerable to decline in older adults; however, the mechanisms behind this vulnerability are still unknown. We demonstrate that object mnemonic discrimination impairment is related to hyperconnectivity between the anterolateral entorhinal cortex and DG/CA3. This hyperconnectivity was associated with amyloid-&beta; pathology and neurodegeneration in entorhinal cortex, suggesting aberrantly increased network activity is a pathological process. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of the vulnerability of object compared to spatial mnemonic discrimination in older adults and has translational implications for choice of outcome measures in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                \textit{Background} The proposed watermarking framework is based on the multi-resolution Walsh-Hadamard Transform (MR-WHT) along with Schur factorization. For embedding, the cover image is converted into a frequency domain using MR-WHT before Schur factorization is applied. \textit{Methods} The upper triangle's highest stable eigenvalues in the Schur factorization are employed as reliable embedding locations for the watermark. The singular values of these coefficients are updated with the singular values of the watermark, and the matrix array generated by the biggest eigenvalues is further factorised by singular value decomposition using multiple scaling factors and Differential evolution (DE). Later, an inverse SVD, inverse Schur, and inverse multiresolution Walsh-Hadamard transform is executed to obtain a watermarked image. \textit{Results} The simulation results show that the proposed method is imperceptible and robust against existing watermarking algorithms used in the literature.

                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

                BACKGROUND COVID-19 has become a major cause of concern globally for the past couple of years considering the number of lives it has claimed. The spectrum of clinical manifestations related to nervous system ranged from ageusia, anosmia to stroke and encephalopathies. The burden of follow-up and review currently lies in front of us, considering the rise of post COVID manifestations in patients. The objective of this research is to determine the neurological complications of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS The current study is a record-based retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. The records of patients admitted to the hospital between January 2021 and July 2021 were reviewed. The information was assessed and analyzed using SPSS 25.0. The results are expressed in the form of mean, standard deviation and proportions. RESULTS 1,000 patients admitted with coronavirus were assessed, and 36 patients with a neurological diagnosis available were found. The mean age was 57.1±1.6 years. Most of the neurological diagnosis included cerebrovascular accidents in 44.4% patients followed by hypokalaemia in 25% of patients. Diabetes mellitus (58.3%) and hypertension (47.2%) were found to be the major contributing co-morbidities. There was a significant association seen between the final diagnosis and the age groups (p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS This research would aid in adapting to better management guidelines as well as an integrated approach to neurovascular complications of the same in future. This is vital considering the increase in various short-term and long-terms effects being reported in the hospitals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Brain connectivity meets reservoir computing</a></h4>

The connectivity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is different from the one observed in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). Can the wiring of actual brains help improve ANNs architectures? Can we learn from ANNs about what network features support computation in the brain when solving a task? At a meso/macro-scale level of the connectivity, ANNs’ architectures are carefully engineered and such those design decisions have crucial importance in many recent performance improvements. On the other hand, BNNs exhibit complex emergent connectivity patterns at all scales. At the individual level, BNNs connectivity results from brain development and plasticity processes, while at the species level, adaptive reconfigurations during evolution also play a major role shaping connectivity. Ubiquitous features of brain connectivity have been identified in recent years, but their role in the brain’s ability to perform concrete computations remains poorly understood. Computational neuroscience studies reveal the influence of specific brain connectivity features only on abstract dynamical properties, although the implications of real brain networks topologies on machine learning or cognitive tasks have been barely explored. Here we present a cross-species study with a hybrid approach integrating real brain connectomes and Bio-Echo State Networks, which we use to solve concrete memory tasks, allowing us to probe the potential computational implications of real brain connectivity patterns on task solving. We find results consistent across species and tasks, showing that biologically inspired networks perform as well as classical echo state networks, provided a minimum level of randomness and diversity of connections is allowed. We also present a framework, <i>bio2art</i>, to map and scale up real connectomes that can be integrated into recurrent ANNs. This approach also allows us to show the crucial importance of the diversity of interareal connectivity patterns, stressing the importance of stochastic processes determining neural networks connectivity in general.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computationally efficient mechanism discovery for cell invasion with uncertainty quantification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel J. VandenHeuvel, Christopher Drovandi, Matthew J. Simpson</p>

Parameter estimation for mathematical models of biological processes is often difficult and depends significantly on the quality and quantity of available data. We introduce an efficient framework using Gaussian processes to discover mechanisms underlying delay, migration, and proliferation in a cell invasion experiment. Gaussian processes are leveraged with bootstrapping to provide uncertainty quantification for the mechanisms that drive the invasion process. Our framework is efficient, parallelisable, and can be applied to other biological problems. We illustrate our methods using a canonical scratch assay experiment, demonstrating how simply we can explore different functional forms and develop and test hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, such as whether delay is present. All code and data to reproduce this work are available at https://github.com/DanielVandH/EquationLearning.jl.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Drug-resistant bacterial infections: We need urgent action and investment that focus on the weakest link</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christiane Dolecek, Sadia Shakoor, Buddha Basnyat, Tochi Okwor, Benn Sartorius</p>

Despite high mortality and morbidity, drug-resistant bacterial infections remain the forgotten pandemic. We argue for strengthening of diagnostics, WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) and infection prevention and control to reduce drug-resistant infections, as an integral part of sustainable high-quality health services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

In a world of multiple crises, the momentum to tackle drug-resistant bacterial infections must not fall further behind. A renewed focus is needed on global infection prevention and control strategies, which are lagging behind in many countries, diagnosis and good antimicrobial stewardship.

Epidemiological data demonstrate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha and Delta are more transmissible, infectious, and pathogenic than previous variants. Phenotypic properties of VOC remain understudied. Here, we provide an extensive functional study of VOC Alpha replication and cell entry phenotypes assisted by reverse genetics, mutational mapping of spike in lentiviral pseudotypes, viral and cellular gene expression studies, and infectivity stability assays in an enhanced range of cell and epithelial culture models. In almost all models, VOC Alpha spread less or equally efficiently as ancestral (B.1) SARS-CoV-2. B.1. and VOC Alpha shared similar susceptibility to serum neutralization. Despite increased relative abundance of specific sgRNAs in the context of VOC Alpha infection, immune gene expression in infected cells did not differ between VOC Alpha and B.1. However, inferior spreading and entry efficiencies of VOC Alpha corresponded to lower abundance of proteolytically cleaved spike products presumably linked to the T<sup>716</sup>I mutation. In addition, we identified a bronchial cell line, NCI-H1299, which supported 24-fold increased growth of VOC Alpha and is to our knowledge the only cell line to recapitulate the fitness advantage of VOC Alpha compared to B.1. Interestingly, also VOC Delta showed a strong (595-fold) fitness advantage over B.1 in these cells. Comparative analysis of chimeric viruses expressing VOC Alpha spike in the backbone of B.1, and vice versa, showed that the specific replication phenotype of VOC Alpha in NCI-H1299 cells is largely determined by its spike protein. Despite undetectable ACE2 protein expression in NCI-H1299 cells, CRISPR/Cas9 <i>knock-out</i> and antibody-mediated blocking experiments revealed that multicycle spread of B.1 and VOC Alpha required ACE2 expression. Interestingly, entry of VOC Alpha, as opposed to B.1 virions, was largely unaffected by treatment with exogenous trypsin or saliva prior to infection, suggesting enhanced resistance of VOC Alpha spike to premature proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular environment of the human respiratory tract. This property may result in delayed degradation of VOC Alpha particle infectivity in conditions typical of mucosal fluids of the upper respiratory tract that may be recapitulated in NCI-H1299 cells closer than in highly ACE2-expressing cell lines and models. Our study highlights the importance of cell model evaluation and comparison for in-depth characterization of virus variant-specific phenotypes and uncovers a fine-tuned interrelationship between VOC Alpha- and host cell-specific determinants that may underlie the increased and prolonged virus shedding detected in patients infected with VOC Alpha.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Survival status and predictors of mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa COVID-19 Care Centers, Ethiopia: A survival analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress on the health care system of many countries worldwide. To accommodate the growing number of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hospitals expanded and tried to meet overwhelming demands. Despite this, outcomes of patients after mechanical ventilation were devastating, with high mortality rates. Therefore, this study investigated the survival status and predictors of mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was applied on the patient charts of 496 critically ill and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients at intensive care units of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Care Centers from September 2020 to October 2021. Data were collected using a data extraction checklist and entered into Epi data manager. Then, data were transferred to STATA V-14 for cleaning and analysis. The cox-proportional hazard regression model was used for analysis. Covariates with p-value ≤0.20 in the bivariate analysis were fitted to multivariate analysis after the model fitness test. Finally, statistical significance was decided at p-value <0.05, and hazard ratios were used to determine the strength of associations. Results: Of the 496 patients, 63.3% had died. The incidence rate of mortality was 56.7 (95% CI: 50.80, 63.37) per 1,000 person-days of observation, with 5534 person-day observations recorded. Advanced age (>60 years old) (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=1.86; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.15) and being invasively ventilated (AHR=2.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 3.26) were associated with increased risk of mortality. Furthermore, presence of diabetes (AHR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.08), shock (AHR=1.99; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.52), and delirium (AHR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.44) were significantly associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: Clear directions are needed in the recommendation of non-invasive versus invasive ventilation, especially among elderly patients. The controversy of when to intubate (early versus late) needs to be clarified as well. Early detection and prompt management of shock is paramount.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Tumour cell suppression by spiroleucettadine through dual regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spiroleucettadine is an alkaloid originally derived from the yellow Leucetta sea sponge. Spiroleucettadine has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of various cancer cell lines and has a high anti-proliferative activity against a non-small cell lung cancer cell line (H522). The mediators of these anti-proliferative effects have not been determined. Therefore, in this study we measured changes in cell death and cell proliferation and their immediate protein mediators in response to spiroleucettadine, toward the aim of ultimately determining target(s) for spiroleucettadine in cancer cells and a more precise description of its mechanism of action. Methods: We used flow cytometry to investigate changes in the cell cycle apoptosis and Western blot to investigate associated protein changes following exposure of H522 cells to varying concentrations of spiroleucettadine. Results: We found evidence for cell cycle arrest at G2/M and associated increases in cyclin B1 expression and CDK1 phosphorylation, as well as an increase in apoptosis alongside marked increase in Bim expression, consistent with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway Conclusions: Any targets for spiroleucettadine that may be proposed are constrained to those with mechanisms of actions that lead to G2/M arrest, induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and changes in the expression of associated proteins.

                Background: Vestibular dysfunction is known to affect cognitive abilities related to the processing of spatial and non-spatial information. P300 is an event-related potential (ERP) used to assess cognitive function. Studies have shown abnormalities in P300 in individuals with vestibular hypofunction.  However, the literature shows equivocal findings for P300 in individuals with vestibular dysfunction. The aim of present study was to compare the latency and amplitude of cortical auditory evoked potential and P300 between individuals with vestibular dysfunction and individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. Methods: Forty adults with a mean age of 40.5 years participated in the study. Group I included 20 adults diagnosed with vestibular dysfunction and group II included 20 age-matched adults with no vestibular dysfunction. The P300 was recorded using pure-tones in an odd-ball paradigm, from electrode sites Cz and Pz. The latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, N2 P300, and N4 were measured. Results:  The results showed no significant difference in the latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, and N2 of the cortical auditory potentials between groups. The P300 was absent in approximately 30% of individuals with vestibular dysfunction meanwhile, it was present in all individuals in group II. The mean latency and amplitude of the P300 and latency of N4 were not significantly different between the groups. However, a significant difference was observed in N4 amplitude between groups at both electrode sites. And, no correlation was observed between the DHI score and the P300 parameters in group I. Conclusions: the P300 was absent in a greater number of individuals with vestibular dysfunction, suggesting cognitive impairment. However, when the P300 was present the peak latency and amplitude showed no significant difference in both groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the synergistic effect of a poly-herbals combination on the antioxidant activity through a statistical approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Poly-herbals combination was applied to enhance biological activity, particularly antioxidant activity. This present study was purposed to assess the synergistic interaction of a combination of five traditional Indonesian herbal plants through a simultaneous and integrated statistical technique. The plants were extracted using maceration, and purification was conducted before extraction to eliminate the ballast compounds. A simplex lattice design comprising 35 design points was utilized to understand herbal combinations' main effect and interaction through multiple linear regression analysis on the antioxidant activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. The results showed that C. longa, P. niruri, and C. xanthorrhiza had the most potent antioxidant activity than M. oleifera and C. asiatica. The presence of C. longa modulated the synergistic interaction between combinations. Meanwhile, the non-curcuminoid content in C. xanthorrhiza played a fundamental role in reducing the antioxidant activity. The synergistic interaction could enhance the antioxidant activity through poly-herbals combination. In addition, particular consideration should be withdrawn by antagonism interaction in the poly-herbals combination for reducing the biological activity.

                Kleinjan et al. demonstrate that formation of hippocampal dually innervated spines (DiSs) occurs early in development and does not require excitatory input. NMDA receptor function and structural plasticity are impaired at DiSs. These effects are mediated through tonic GABAB receptor signaling and may contribute to long-term DiS stability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The CIC-ERF co-deletion underlies fusion-independent activation of ETS family member, ETV1, to drive prostate cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Human prostate cancer can result from chromosomal rearrangements that lead to aberrant ETS gene expression. The mechanisms that lead to fusion-independent ETS factor upregulation and prostate oncogenesis remain relatively unknown. Here, we show that two neighboring transcription factors, Capicua (<i>CIC</i>) and ETS2 repressor factor (<i>ERF</i>), which are co-deleted in human prostate tumors can drive prostate oncogenesis. Concurrent <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i> loss commonly occur through focal genomic deletions at chromosome 19q13.2. Mechanistically, <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i> co-bind the proximal regulatory element and mutually repress the ETS transcription factor, <i>ETV1</i>. Targeting ETV1 in <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i>-deficient prostate cancer limits tumor growth. Thus, we have uncovered a fusion-independent mode of ETS transcriptional activation defined by concurrent loss of <i>CIC</i> and <i>ERF</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defocus corrected large area cryo-EM (DeCo-LACE) for label-free detection of molecules across entire cell sections</a></h4>

              
                A major goal of biological imaging is localization of biomolecules inside a cell. Fluorescence microscopy can localize biomolecules inside whole cells and tissues, but its ability to count biomolecules and accuracy of the spatial coordinates is limited by the wavelength of visible light. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides highly accurate position and orientation information of biomolecules but is often confined to small fields of view inside a cell, limiting biological context. In this study we use a new data-acquisition scheme called 'Defocus-Corrected Large-Area cryo-EM' (DeCo-LACE) to collect high-resolution images of entire sections (100 - 250 nm thick lamellae) of neutrophil-like mouse cells, representing 1-2% of the total cellular volume. We use 2D template matching (2DTM) to determine localization and orientation of the large ribosomal subunit in these sections. These data provide 'maps' of ribosomes across entire sections of mammalian cells. This high-throughput cryo-EM data collection approach together with 2DTM will advance visual proteomics and provide biological insight that cannot be obtained by other methods.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reevaluation of Piezo1 as a gut RNA sensor</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is a stretch-gated ion channel required for mechanosensation in many organ systems. Recent findings point to a new role for Piezo1 in the gut, suggesting that it is a sensor of microbial single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) rather than mechanical force. If true, this would redefine the scope of Piezo biology. Here, we sought to replicate the central finding that fecal ssRNA is a natural agonist of Piezo1. While we observe that fecal extracts and ssRNA can stimulate calcium influx in certain cell lines, this response is independent of Piezo1. Additionally, sterilized dietary extracts devoid of gut biome RNA show similar cell line-specific stimulatory activity to fecal extracts. Together, our data highlight potential confounds inherent to gut-derived extracts, exclude Piezo1 as a receptor for ssRNA in the gut, and support a dedicated role for Piezo channels in mechanosensing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic architecture of natural variation of cardiac performance from flies to humans</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering the genetic architecture of human cardiac disorders is of fundamental importance but their underlying complexity is a major hurdle. We investigated the natural variation of cardiac performance in the sequenced inbred lines of the <i>Drosophila</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) identified genetic networks associated with natural variation of cardiac traits which were used to gain insights as to the molecular and cellular processes affected. Non-coding variants that we identified were used to map potential regulatory non-coding regions, which in turn were employed to predict transcription factors (TFs) binding sites. Cognate TFs, many of which themselves bear polymorphisms associated with variations of cardiac performance, were also validated by heart-specific knockdown. Additionally, we showed that the natural variations associated with variability in cardiac performance affect a set of genes overlapping those associated with average traits but through different variants in the same genes. Furthermore, we showed that phenotypic variability was also associated with natural variation of gene regulatory networks. More importantly, we documented correlations between genes associated with cardiac phenotypes in both flies and humans, which supports a conserved genetic architecture regulating adult cardiac function from arthropods to mammals. Specifically, roles for PAX9 and EGR2 in the regulation of the cardiac rhythm were established in both models, illustrating that the characteristics of natural variations in cardiac function identified in <i>Drosophila</i> can accelerate discovery in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binary and analog variation of synapses between cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Learning from experience depends at least in part on changes in neuronal connections. We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (L2/3 pyramidal cells in mouse primary visual cortex), which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects (250×140×90 μm<sup>3</sup> volume). We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes by a log-normal distribution. A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells, is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size . We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors, while analog variation may be dominated by other influences such as spontaneous dynamical fluctuations. We discuss the implications for the longstanding hypothesis that activity-dependent plasticity switches synapses between bistable states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The perceptual nature of illusory object recognition</a></h4>

              
                We occasionally misinterpret ambiguous sensory input or report a stimulus when none is presented. It is unknown whether such errors have a sensory origin and reflect true perceptual illusions, or whether they have a more cognitive origin (e.g., are due to guessing), or both. When participants performed an error-prone and challenging face/house discrimination task, multivariate EEG analyses revealed that during decision errors (mistaking a face for a house), sensory stages of visual information processing initially represent the presented stimulus category. Crucially however, when participants were confident in their erroneous decision, so when the illusion was strongest, this neural representation flipped later in time and reflected the incorrectly reported percept. This flip in neural pattern was absent for decisions that were made with low confidence. This work demonstrates that decision confidence arbitrates between perceptual decision errors, which reflect true illusions of perception, and cognitive decision errors, which do not.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating Quantitative and Functional MRI As Potential Techniques to Identify the Subdivisions in the Human Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Segmenting the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has been challenging yet remains an important goal because the LGN is the only place in the brain where these two information streams are spatially disjoint and can be studied independently. Previous research used the amplitude of responses to different types of stimuli to separate M and P regions (Denison et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, this method is confounded because the hilum region of the LGN exhibits greater response amplitudes to all stimuli and can be mistaken for the M subdivision (DeSimone & Schneider, 2019). Therefore, we have employed two independent methodologies that do not rely upon the functional response properties of the M and P neurons to segment the M and P regions: 1. structural quantitative MRI (qMRI) at 3T to measure the T1 relaxation time, and 2. monocular and dichoptic functional MRI (fMRI) procedures to measure eye-specific responses. Our qMRI results agreed with the anatomical expectations, identifying M regions on the ventromedial surface of the LGN. The monocular fMRI procedure was better than the dichoptic condition to identify the eye-dominance signals. Both procedures revealed significant right eye bias, and neither could reliably identify the first M layer of the LGN. These findings indicated that the qMRI methods are promising whereas the functional identification of contralateral layers requires further refinement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling dementia in Drosophila uncovers shared and specific targets of TDP-43 proteinopathy across ALS and FTD relevant circuits</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) comprise a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases linked to TDP-43 proteinopathy. At the cellular level, TDP-43 proteinopathies are characterized by loss of nuclear TDP-43 and accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 puncta that ultimately cause RNA processing defects including dysregulation of splicing, mRNA transport and translation. Complementing our previous models of ALS, here we report a novel model of FTD based on overexpression of TDP-43 in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) circuit. This model recapitulates several aspects of FTD pathology including age dependent nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 accompanied by behavioral deficits in working memory and sleep that occur before axonal degeneration ensues. RNA immunoprecipitations identify several candidate mRNA targets of TDP-43 in MBs, some of which are specific to the MB circuit and others that are shared with motor neurons. Using genetic interactions we show that overexpression of Dally-like-protein (Dlp), a modulator of Wg/Wnt signaling in MBs mitigates TDP-43 dependent working memory deficits. These results highlight the utility of modelling TDP-43 proteinopathy in Drosophila and provide a novel platform for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying FTD, and potentially uncovering circuit specific vulnerabilities in ALS/FTD.

                In most models, dopamine is not involved in the initiation but only in the long-term maintenance of LTP and memory. Conversely, we discovered that repeatedly stimulating Schaffer collaterals in concomitance with midbrain dopamine afferents to CA1 triggers hippocampal LTP. Moreover, we show that this dopamine pathway is involved in contextual learning. Thus, midbrain dopamine can play the role of a teaching signal triggering non Hebbian LTP and allowing supervised learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of alpha suppression index both modality specific and general attention processes</a></h4>

              
                EEG alpha power varies under many circumstances requiring visual attention. However, mounting evidence indicates that alpha may not only serve visual processing, but also the processing of stimuli presented in other sensory modalities, including hearing. We previously showed that alpha dynamics during an auditory task vary as a function of competition from the visual modality (Clements et al., 2022) suggesting that alpha may be engaged in multimodal processing. Here we assessed the impact of allocating attention to the visual or auditory modality on alpha dynamics, during the preparatory period of a bimodal-cued conflict task. In this task, precues indicated the modality (vision, hearing) relevant to a subsequent reaction stimulus. This task afforded us the opportunity to assess alpha during modality-specific preparation and while switching between modalities. Alpha suppression following the precue occurred in all conditions indicating that it may reflect general preparatory mechanisms. However, we observed a switch effect when preparing to attend to the auditory modality, in which greater alpha suppression was elicited when switching to the auditory modality compared to repeating. No switch effect was evident when preparing to attend to visual information (although robust suppression did occur in both conditions). In addition, waning alpha suppression preceded error trials, irrespective of sensory modality. These findings indicate that alpha can be used to monitor the level of preparatory attention to process both visual and auditory information. These results support the emerging view that alpha band activity may index a general attention control mechanism used across modalities, at least vision and hearing.

                Although considerable progress has been made in finding a therapy for Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, there still is no effective approved treatment. Previously, we reported results from a small molecule screen that was conducted on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (CT60) that lacked NPC1 expression. The hit compounds that were effective in reducing cholesterol accumulation in CT60 cells were not effective on human cells bearing disease causing mutations in NPC1. Hence, we conducted a new small molecule screen on patient-derived NPC1 skin fibroblasts using a combinatorial library of ~48,000 compounds. We have identified several compounds that corrected the phenotype in human heterozygous mutant NPC1 skin fibroblasts (GM03123) bearing the inactivating I1061T mutation in one allele and another set of inactivating mutations in the other. Among the hit compounds were several histone deacetylase inhibitors, which we have explored further and reported previously. With the determination of the structure of NPC1 protein and the development of computational docking algorithms, it seems worthwhile to show the structures of 128 compounds that reproducibly reduced cholesterol storage in mutant NPC1 fibroblasts but with no known mechanism of action. These compounds were not toxic and specifically effective on mutant cells but not on NPC1-/- cells, indicating on-target effect directly or indirectly.

                Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation is regulated by nutritional signals in the adult median eminence (ME), but the consequences on local myelination are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterise myelin plasticity in the ME of adult mice in health or in response to chronic nutritional challenge. We assessed new oligodendrocyte and myelin generation and stability in the ME of healthy adult male mice using bromodeoxyuridine labelling and genetic fate mapping tools. We assessed the contribution of microglia to ME myelin plasticity in PLX5622-treated C57BL6/J mice and in Pdgfra-Cre/ERT2;R26R-eYFP;Myrffl/fl mice, where adult oligodendrogenesis is genetically blunted. Finally, we investigated how 45% high fat diet or 70% caloric restriction feeding paradigms impact ME oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelination in C57BL6/J mice. We show that myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) are continuously and rapidly generated in the adult ME. Paradoxically, OL number and myelin amounts remain remarkably stable in the adult ME. In fact, the high rate of new OL and myelin generation in the ME is offset by continuous turnover of both. We show that microglia are required for continuous OL and myelin production, and that ME myelin plasticity regulates the recruitment of local immune cells. Finally, we provide evidence that ME myelination is regulated by the energetic status, decreased in calorie-restricted animals, and increased in mice fed a high fat diet. This study uncovers a previously unappreciated form of ME structural plasticity and mechanism of myelin remodeling in the adult brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Female-Specific Pituitary Hypersensitivity to Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone in a Mouse Model of Chronic Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Gonadotropin hormone release from the anterior pituitary is critical to regulating reproductive endocrine function. Clinical evidence has documented that people with epilepsy display altered levels of gonadotropin hormones, both acutely following seizures and chronically. Despite this relationship, pituitary function remains a largely understudied avenue in preclinical epilepsy research. Recently, we showed that females in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy were found to display changes in pituitary expression of gonadotropin hormone and GnRH receptor genes. Circulating gonadotropin hormone levels, however, have yet to be measured in an animal model of epilepsy. Here, we evaluated the circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), GnRH receptor (Gnrhr) gene expression, and sensitivity to exogenous GnRH in IHKA males and females. Although no changes in overall dynamics of pulsatile patterns of LH release were found in IHKA mice of either sex, estrus vs. diestrus changes in basal and mean LH levels were larger in IHKA females with prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles. In addition, IHKA females displayed increased pituitary sensitivity to GnRH and higher Gnrhr expression. The hypersensitivity to GnRH was observed on diestrus, but not estrus. Chronic seizure severity was not found to be correlated with LH parameters, and FSH levels were unchanged in IHKA mice. These results indicate that although there are changes in pituitary gene expression and sensitivity to GnRH in IHKA females, there may also be compensatory mechanisms that aid in maintaining gonadotropin release in the state of chronic epilepsy in this model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory prediction hierarchy in the human hippocampus and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Our brains can extract structure from the environment and form predictions given past sensory experience. Predictive circuits have been identified in wide-spread cortical regions. However, the contribution of subcortical areas, such as the hippocampus and amygdala in the formation of predictions remains under-explored. Here, we hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to predictability in sound sequences, while the amygdala would be sensitive to unexpected violations of auditory rules. We presented epileptic patients undergoing presurgical monitoring with standard and deviant sounds, in a predictable or unpredictable context. Onsets of auditory responses and unpredictable deviance effects were detected at earlier latencies in the temporal cortex compared to the amygdala and hippocampus. Deviance effects in 1-20 Hz local field potentials were detected in the lateral temporal cortex, irrespective of predictability. The amygdala showed stronger deviance responses in the unpredictable context. Additionally, low frequency deviance responses in the hippocampus (1-8 Hz) were observed in the predictable but not in the unpredictable context. Our results reveal a distributed cortical-subcortical network underlying the generation of auditory predictions, comprising temporal cortex, the hippocampus and amygdala, and suggest that the neural basis of sensory predictions and prediction error signals needs to be extended to subcortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feeling lucky? Prospective and retrospective cues for sensorimotor confidence</a></h4>

              
                On a daily basis, humans interact with the outside world using judgments of sensorimotor confidence, constantly evaluating our actions for success. We ask, what sensory and motorexecution cues are used in making these judgements and when are they available? Two sources of temporally distinct information are prospective cues, available prior to the action (e.g., knowledge of motor noise and past performance), and retrospective cues specific to the action itself (e.g., proprioceptive measurements). We investigated the use of these two cues in two tasks, a secondary motor-awareness task and a main task in which participants reached toward a visual target with an unseen hand and then made a continuous judgment of confidence about the success of the reach. Confidence was reported by setting the size of a circle centered on the reach-target location, where a larger circle reflects lower confidence. Points were awarded if the confidence circle enclosed the true endpoint, with fewer points returned for larger circles. This incentivized accurate reaches and attentive reporting to maximize the score. We compared three Bayesian-inference models of sensorimotor confidence based on either prospective cues, retrospective cues, or both sources of information to maximize expected gain (i.e., an ideal-performance model). Our findings showed two distinct strategies: participants either performed as ideal observers, using both prospective and retrospective cues to make the confidence judgment, or relied solely on prospective information, ignoring retrospective cues. Thus, participants can make use of retrospective cues, evidenced by the behavior observed in our motorawareness task, but these cues are not always included in the computation of sensorimotor confidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A systematically optimized awake mouse fMRI paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been increasingly utilized in mice. Due to the non-negligible effects of anesthetics on mouse fMRI, it is becoming more common to perform fMRI in the awake mice. However, high stress level and head motion in awake mouse fMRI remain to be fully addressed, which limits its practical applications. Therefore, here we presented a systematically optimized awake mouse fMRI paradigm as a practical and open-source solution. First, we designed a soundproof habituation chamber in which multiple mice can be habituated simultaneously and independently. Then, combining corticosterone, body weight and behavioral measurements, we systematically evaluated the potential factors that may contribute to animals' stress level for awake imaging. Among many factors, we found that the restraining setup allowing forelimbs freely moving and head tilted at 30-degree was optimal for minimizing stress level. Importantly, we implemented multiband simultaneous multi-slice imaging to enable ultrafast fMRI acquisition in awake mice. Compared to conventional single-band EPI, faster acquisition enabled by multiband imaging were more robust to head motion and yielded higher statistical power. Thus, more robust resting-state functional connectivity was detected using multiband acquisition in awake mouse fMRI, compared to conventional single-band acquisition. In conclusion, we presented an awake mouse fMRI paradigm that is highly optimized in both awake mice habituation and fMRI acquisition, and such paradigm minimized animals' stress level and provided more resistance to head motion and higher statistical power. Keywords: awake mice, fMRI, stress level, head motion, simultaneous multi-slice.

                Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) constitutes the structural basis underlying flexible cognitive control, where mixed-selective neural populations encode multiple task-features to guide subsequent behavior. The mechanisms by which the brain simultaneously encodes multiple task-relevant variables while minimizing interference from task-irrelevant features remain unknown. Leveraging intracranial recordings from the human PFC, we first demonstrate that competition between co-existing representations of past and present task variables incurs a behavioral switch cost. Our results reveal that this interference between past and present states in the PFC is resolved through coding partitioning into distinct low-dimensional neural states; thereby strongly attenuating behavioral switch costs. In sum, these findings uncover a fundamental coding mechanism that constitutes a central building block of flexible cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Release site plasticity via Unc13A regulatory domains mediates synaptic short-term facilitation and homeostatic potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synaptic transmission relies on neurotransmitter release from presynaptic release sites and on transmitter-sensing by the postsynaptic cell. Presynaptic plasticity increasing neurotransmitter release achieves two fundamental nervous system functions: It tunes some synapses to be more responsive to millisecond repetitive activation and it maintains signals when postsynaptic transmitter sensitivity is reduced. How enhanced neurotransmitter release is achieved in these phenomena, termed short-term facilitation and homeostatic potentiation, remains unknown. We combine mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of Drosophila neuromuscular junction model synapses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity. Our results indicate that both phenomena depend on a rapid increase in the participation of neurotransmitter release sites which is controlled by the regulatory domains of the evolutionarily conserved (M)Unc13A protein that bind Ca2+/Calmodulin and diacylglycerol. Mutation of the Calmodulin binding (CaM) domain increased baseline transmission and impaired both short-term facilitation and acute homeostatic potentiation. Mathematical modeling indicated that these defects result from too many release sites participating at rest combined with the inability to plastically further increase their number. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that this coincided with a redistribution of Unc13A`s functionally essential MUN domain closer to the synaptic plasma membrane, which may constitute the molecular switch to increase release site participation. Similar consequences (enhanced baseline transmission, block of both short-term facilitation and homeostatic potentiation) were caused by the acute pharmacological activation of the C1 domain of wildtype Unc13A using phorbol esters. This treatment had no effect on Unc13A CaM domain mutants, indicating that both the CaM and C1 domains activate a binary release site switch. Thus, our findings indicate that Unc13A regulatory domains are tuned to integrate a multitude of signals on various timescales to switch release site participation for synaptic plasticity.

                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are associated with disrupted functional organization in brain networks, yet the finer changes in the topological organization in aMCI and AD remain to be investigated. Connectome gradients are a new tool representing brain functional topological organization in a low-dimensional space to smoothly capture the human macroscale hierarchy. Methods: Here, we examined altered topological organization in aMCI and AD by connectome gradient mapping. We further quantified functional segregation by gradient dispersion. Then, we systematically compared the alterations observed in aMCI and AD patients with those in normal controls (NCs) in a two-dimensional functional gradient space from both the whole-brain level and module level. Results: Compared with NCs, the first gradient, which described the neocortical hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal regions, showed a distributed and significant suppression in AD patients, while abnormalities were only limited to local regions in aMCI patients. The second gradient showed a decreased pattern in the somatomotor module in both aMCI and AD patients. Furthermore, gradient dispersion showed significant decreases in AD patients at both the global level and module level, whereas this alteration was limited only to limbic areas in aMCI. Notably, we demonstrated that suppressed gradient dispersion in aMCI and AD patients was associated with cognitive scores. Conclusions: Changes in functional gradients could reflect different degrees of altered brain network segregation in aMCI and AD. These findings provide new evidence for altered brain hierarchy in aMCI and AD, which strengthens our understanding of the progressive mechanism of cognitive decline.

                The thalamus enables key sensory, motor, emotive, and cognitive processes via connections to the cortex. These projection patterns are traditionally considered to originate from discrete thalamic nuclei, however recent work showing gradients of molecular and connectivity features in the thalamus suggests the organisation of thalamocortical connections occurs along a continuous dimension. By performing a joint decomposition of densely sampled gene expression and non-invasive diffusion tractography in the adult human thalamus, we define a principal axis of genetic and connectomic variation along a medial-lateral thalamic axis. Projections along this axis correspond to an anterior-posterior cortical pattern and are aligned with electrophysiological properties of the cortex. The medial-lateral axis demonstrates phylogenetic conservation, reflects transitions in neuronal subtypes, and shows associations with neurodevelopment and common brain disorders. This study provides evidence for a supra-nuclear axis of thalamocortical organisation characterised by a graded transition in molecular properties and anatomical connectivity.

                The ability for animals to adapt their behaviors to specific environments is imperative to increase their evolutionary success. This is particularly true for behaviors such as parental behaviors that directly affect reproductive fitness. Here, we identified an oviposition behavior in the nematode C. elegans that increases the survival of the young. In standard laboratory culture, the bacterivorous hermaphrodite mothers lay eggs across a 2D E. coli lawn with no discernable pattern. However, in 3D culture they display a stereotypical behavior in which they temporarily leave the bacteria to lay eggs far away from the E. coli colony, resulting in a scattered ring of eggs located outside the bacteria. This oviposition behavior requires low oxygen levels and is regulated by the neuropeptide FLP-17 and its cognate receptor EGL-6. We confirm that a circuitry involving the oxygen-sensing BAG neurons and the vulva muscle-controlling HSN motor neurons regulates oviposition behavior. We show that loss of proper oviposition behavior results in lower reproductive fitness for the mothers and embryonic lethality for the eggs laid in bacteria under hypoxic conditions. Finally, we show that the degree of oviposition behavior varies among wild strains of C. elegans found in nature. The ability for C. elegans mothers to sense their environments and adjust their behaviors in adverse conditions is likely an adaptation that has allowed the worm to thrive in diverse and often hazardous habitats.

                Electroencephalography (EEG) holds promise for brain-computer interface (BCI) devices as a non-invasive measure of neural activity. With increased attention to EEG-based BCI systems, publicly available datasets that can represent the complex tasks required for naturalistic speech decoding are necessary to establish a common standard of performance within the BCI community. Effective solutions must overcome various kinds of noise in the EEG signal and remain reliable across sessions and subjects without overfitting to a specific dataset or task. We present two validated datasets (N=8 and N=16) for classification at the phoneme and word level and by the articulatory properties of phonemes. EEG signals were recorded from 64 channels while subjects listened to and repeated six consonants and five vowels. Individual phonemes were combined in different phonetic environments to produce coarticulated variation in forty consonant-vowel pairs, twenty real words, and twenty pseudowords. Phoneme pairs and words were presented during a control condition and during transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to inhibit or augment the EEG signal associated with specific articulatory processes.

                De novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PTEN are strongly associated with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, it is unclear how heterozygous mutations in this gene affects different cell types during human brain development, and how these effects vary across individuals. Here, we used human cortical organoids from different donors to identify cell-type-specific developmental events that are affected by heterozygous mutations in PTEN. We profiled individual organoids by single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics and spatial transcriptomics, and revealed abnormalities in developmental timing in human outer radial glia progenitors and deep layer cortical projection neurons, which varied with the donor genetic background. Calcium imaging in intact organoids showed that both accelerated and delayed neuronal development phenotypes resulted in similar abnormal activity of local circuits, irrespective of genetic background. The work reveals donor-dependent, cell-type specific developmental phenotypes of PTEN heterozygosity that later converge on disrupted neuronal activity.

	<p>Background: A growing literature, mostly based on selected populations, indicates that traumas may be associated with autoimmune diseases, yet few studies exist on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in the general population. Objective: We assessed cross-sectional associations between self-reported ACEs and MS among Icelandic women in the population-based Stress-And-Gene-Analysis (SAGA) cohort. Methods: Participants (n = 27,870; mean age 44.9 years) answered a web-based survey that included the ACE-International Questionnaire and a question about MS diagnosis. Log-linear Poisson regression models estimated MS prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for ACEs adjusted for covariates. Results: 214 women reported having been diagnosed with MS (crude prevalence = 7.7 per 1000). Compared to women without MS, women with MS reported more fatigue, body pain and bladder problems. The average cumulative number of ACEs was 2.1. After adjustment for age, education, childhood deprivation, smoking and depressive symptoms, MS prevalence did not increase with increasing ACEs exposure (PR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.92, 1.09). Thirteen ACE categories, including abuse, neglect, household dysfunction and violence were not individually or independently associated with MS. Conclusion: Limited by self-reported data and cross-sectional design, results do not consistently support associations between ACEs in the development of MS among adult Icelandic women.</p>

	<p>Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system (SS-CNS) is a rare condition characterized by a hemosiderin accumulation along the subpial surfaces and arises from an intermittent chronic bleeding in the subarachnoid space usually as a result of a chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage by trauma, vascular malformations, CNS tumors, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We present a 61-year-old male with a 12-year history of limb weakness, muscle wasting, cramps, clumsiness, progressive unsteady gait, and fine motor impairments. His medical history included the resection of a left parietal meningioma and a myxopapillary ependymoma near the conus terminalis (L3/4) at the age of 51 years. The clinical examination revealed a motor neuron syndrome with a clear bilateral wasting of the hand muscles, a diffuse atrophy of the shoulder and calf muscles, and a weakness of the arms, fingers, hips, and feet. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically briskly hyperactive. Standing and walking were only possible with a support. Magnetic resonance imaging of the entire neuroaxis showed progressive severe cerebral, brainstem, and spinal superficial siderosis in form of extensive hypointensities on T2-weighted gradient-echo images and susceptibility-weighted sequences. Despite a successful neurosurgical removal of the tumors and delaed medical treatment with an iron chelator for one year, we observed no clinical recovery or stability in our patient, making this case unique, and suggesting an irreversible neurodegenerative process. This case reinforces the need of including SS-CNS in the list of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-mimics and demonstrates the fundamental use of a complete neuraxial MRI investigation on evaluating possible ALS cases.</p>

	<p>In recent years, head injuries in sports have garnered attention, and in particular, international discussions have been held on the prevention of and response to sports-related concussions (SRCs). The purpose of this study is to investigate past SRCs experienced by university students in Japan, clarify the state and mechanism of such injuries in each sport, and consider the creation of an environment for future SRC prevention and responses. A questionnaire survey on past SRC experience was conducted among 1731 students who belonged to Fukuoka University in Japan and took &amp;amp;ldquo;sports medicine&amp;amp;rdquo; classes in 2020. Responses from 1140 students (collection rate: 65.9%) were obtained. According to this survey, it was revealed that 39 students (3.7%) had experienced SRC. The male&amp;amp;ndash;female ratio of those who had experienced SRC was 31 males (79.5%) and 8 females (20.5%). Two males had experienced SRC twice. In this study, SRCs were recognized in a variety of sports, not just in a few contact sports. It is necessary to further disseminate education on head injury prevention and SRCs among both athletes and coaches, because SRCs have been frequently recognized in various sports.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Examination of Diurnal Variation and Sex Differences in Hippocampal Neurophysiology and Spatial Memory</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Circadian rhythms are biological processes that cycle across 24 h and regulate many facets of neurophysiology, including learning and memory. Circadian variation in spatial memory task performance is well documented; however, the effect of sex across circadian time (CT) remains unclear. Additionally, little is known regarding the impact of time-of-day on hippocampal neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the influence of both sex and time-of-day on hippocampal neurophysiology and memory in mice. Performance on the object location memory (OLM) task depended on both circadian time and sex, with memory enhanced at night in males but during the day in females. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses was greater at night compared with day in both sexes. Next, we measured spontaneous synaptic excitation and inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Frequency and amplitude of inhibition was greater during the day compared with night, regardless of sex. Frequency and amplitude of excitation was larger in females, compared with males, independent of time-of-day, although both time-of-day and sex influenced presynaptic release probability. At night, CA1 pyramidal neurons showed enhanced excitability (action potential firing and/or baseline potential) that was dependent on synaptic excitation and inhibition, regardless of sex. This study emphasizes the importance of sex and time-of-day in hippocampal physiology, especially given that many neurologic disorders impacting the hippocampus are linked to circadian disruption and present differently in men and women. Knowledge about how sex and circadian rhythms affect hippocampal physiology can improve the translational relevancy of therapeutics and inform the appropriate timing of existing treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Exposure Dysregulates Nucleus Basalis Magnocellularis Afferents in the Basolateral Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulate the acquisition and consolidation of fear-like and anxiety-like behaviors. However, it is unclear whether the alterations in the NBM-BLA circuit promote negative affect during ethanol withdrawal (WD). Therefore, we performed <I>ex vivo</I> whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in both the NBM and the BLA of male Sprague Dawley rats following 10 d of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure and 24 h of WD. We found that CIE exposure and withdrawal enhanced the neuronal excitability of NBM putative "cholinergic" neurons. We subsequently used optogenetics to directly manipulate NBM terminal activity within the BLA and measure cholinergic modulation of glutamatergic afferents and BLA pyramidal neurons. Our findings indicate that CIE and withdrawal upregulate NBM cholinergic facilitation of glutamate release via activation of presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Ethanol withdrawal-induced increases in NBM terminal activity also enhance BLA pyramidal neuron firing. Collectively, our results provide a novel characterization of the NBM-BLA circuit and suggest that CIE-dependent modifications to NBM afferents enhance BLA pyramidal neuron activity during ethanol withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulation of Synaptic and Developmental Transcriptomic/Proteomic Profiles upon Depletion of MUNC18-1</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Absence of presynaptic protein MUNC18-1 (gene: <I>Stxbp1</I>) leads to neuronal cell death at an immature stage before synapse formation. Here, we performed transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of immature <I>Stxbp1</I> knock-out (KO) cells to discover which cellular processes depend on MUNC18-1. Hippocampi of <I>Stxbp1</I> KO mice showed cell type-specific dysregulation of 2123 transcripts primarily related to synaptic transmission and immune response. To further investigate direct, neuron-specific effects of MUNC18-1 depletion, a proteomic screen was performed on murine neuronal cultures at two developmental timepoints before onset of neuron degeneration. 399 proteins were differentially expressed, which were primarily involved in synaptic function (especially synaptic vesicle exocytosis) and neuron development. We further show that many of the downregulated proteins on loss of MUNC18-1 are normally upregulated during this developmental stage. Thus, absence of MUNC18-1 extensively dysregulates the transcriptome and proteome, primarily affecting synaptic and developmental profiles. Lack of synaptic activity is unlikely to underlie these effects, as the changes were observed in immature neurons without functional synapses, and minimal overlap was found to activity-dependent proteins. We hypothesize that presence of MUNC18-1 is essential to advance neuron development, serving as a "checkpoint" for neurons to initiate cell death in its absence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Different levels of circadian (de)synchrony ­– where does it hurt? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A network of cellular timers ensures the maintenance of homeostasis by temporal modulation of physiological processes across the day. These so-called circadian clocks are synchronized to geophysical time by external time cues (or zeitgebers). In modern societies, natural environmental cycles are disrupted by artificial lighting, around-the-clock availability of food or shiftwork. Such contradictory zeitgeber input promotes chronodisruption, i.e., the perturbation of internal circadian rhythms, resulting in adverse health outcomes. While this phenomenon is well described, it is still poorly understood at which level of organization perturbed rhythms impact on health and wellbeing. In this review, we discuss different levels of chronodisruption and what is known about their health effects. We summarize the results of disrupted phase coherence between external and internal time vs. misalignment of tissue clocks amongst each other, i.e., internal desynchrony. Last, phase incoherence can also occur at the tissue level itself. Here, alterations in phase coordination can emerge between cellular clocks of the same tissue or between different clock genes within the single cell. A better understanding of the mechanisms of circadian misalignment and its effects on physiology will help to find effective tools to prevent or treat disorders arising from modern-day chronodisruptive environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Avian influenza (H5N1) virus, epidemiology and its effects on backyard poultry in Indonesia: a review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Avian influenza (AI) is a zoonotic viral endemic disease that affects poultry, swine, and mammals, including humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is caused by influenza type A virus subtypes H5, and H7 which are naturally carried by a wild bird and often affect domestic poultry. Avian influenza (AI) is a major problem worldwide that causes significant economic losses in the poultry sector. Since 2003, the widespread H5N1 HPAI in poultry has led to high mortalities resulting in huge economic losses in the poultry sector in Indonesia. Domestic poultry is a key source of income that contributes to economic growth, both directly and indirectly, by reducing poverty among the people living in rural communities. Furthermore, in many developing countries, including Indonesia, rural people meet a portion of their food needs through backyard poultry. Nevertheless, this sector is strongly affected by biosecurity hazards, particularly in Indonesia by HPAI infections. Avian influenza (AI), subtype H5N1 has zoonotic significance, posing major risks to public health and poultry. Due to close interaction between wild migratory birds and ducks, the domestic poultry sector in Indonesia is directly affected by this virus. This virus continues to be ubiquitous in Indonesia as a result of the unpredictable mutations produced by antigenic drift and shift, which can persist from a few days to several years. In this review, the epidemiology and impact, of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype virus infection on backyard poultry in Indonesia were discussed.

                Background: Written batik is one of Indonesia's cultural heritages that must be preserved. During the Covid-19 pandemic, written batik producers in Indonesia experienced increasing challenges due to the uncertainty of the business environment. Innovation is a solution to the problems faced by SMEs during a pandemic to survive. This study aims to examine the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability. This study also examines the role of moderating environmental uncertainty in strengthening the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability. Methods: The research was conducted at the centre of small and medium-sized batik companies Giriloyo, Bantul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Respondents of this study were 130 small and medium companies selected by random sampling. The questionnaire is used as a primary data collection tool. WarpPLS has been used to analyze the effect between variables in this study. Results: Entrepreneurship orientation is an important aspect in improving the innovation capabilities of SMEs. Environmental uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capabilities. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that entrepreneurship orientation has a significant effect on innovation capabilities. Environmental uncertainty significantly strengthens the effect of entrepreneurship orientation on innovation capability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Brain-wide connectome inferences using functional connectivity MultiVariate Pattern Analyses (fc-MVPA)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alfonso Nieto-Castanon</p>

Current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging technology is able to resolve billions of individual functional connections characterizing the human connectome. Classical statistical inferential procedures attempting to make valid inferences across this many measures from a reduced set of observations and from a limited number of subjects can be severely underpowered for any but the largest effect sizes. This manuscript discusses fc-MVPA (functional connectivity Multivariate Pattern Analysis), a novel method using multivariate pattern analysis techniques in the context of brain-wide connectome inferences. The theory behind fc-MVPA is presented, and several of its key concepts are illustrated through examples from a publicly available resting state dataset, including an analysis of gender differences across the entire functional connectome. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of this method. In addition to offering powerful whole-brain inferences, fc-MVPA also provides a meaningful characterization of the heterogeneity in functional connectivity across subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Incomplete bunyavirus particles can cooperatively support virus infection and spread</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erick Bermúdez-Méndez, Kirsten F. Bronsvoort, Mark P. Zwart, Sandra van de Water, Ingrid Cárdenas-Rey, Rianka P. M. Vloet, Constantianus J. M. Koenraadt, Gorben P. Pijlman, Jeroen Kortekaas, Paul J. Wichgers Schreur</p>

Bunyaviruses lack a specific mechanism to ensure the incorporation of a complete set of genome segments into each virion, explaining the generation of incomplete virus particles lacking one or more genome segments. Such incomplete virus particles, which may represent the majority of particles produced, are generally considered to interfere with virus infection and spread. Using the three-segmented arthropod-borne Rift Valley fever virus as a model bunyavirus, we here show that two distinct incomplete virus particle populations unable to spread autonomously are able to efficiently complement each other in both mammalian and insect cells following co-infection. We further show that complementing incomplete virus particles can co-infect mosquitoes, resulting in the reconstitution of infectious virus that is able to disseminate to the mosquito salivary glands. Computational models of infection dynamics predict that incomplete virus particles can positively impact virus spread over a wide range of conditions, with the strongest effect at intermediate multiplicities of infection. Our findings suggest that incomplete particles may play a significant role in within-host spread and between-host transmission, reminiscent of the infection cycle of multipartite viruses.

                The mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unclear. In this review, we examine potential mechanism that may explain why the sense of smell is lost or altered. Among the current hypotheses, the most plausible is that death of infected support cells in the olfactory epithelium causes – besides altered composition of the mucus – retraction of the cilia on olfactory receptor neurons, possibly because of lack of support-cell derived glucose in the mucus that powers olfactory signal transduction within the cilia.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A dietary change to a high-fat diet initiates a rapid adaptation of the intestine</a></h4>

              
                Enriquez et al. demonstrate that animals immediately adapt within days to a change in diet, both in whole-body physiology and at the cellular level in the small intestine. Single-cell transcriptional analysis following a shift to HFD shows that cells display unique adaptive responses that suggest striking adaptive ability during nutrient availability.

                IFN-Is are pleiotropic cytokines enriched in the tumor microenvironment. Chen et al. show that a high IFN-I-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in CD8+ T cells correlates with poor survival and anti-PD-1 therapy resistance in patients with cancer. Mechanistically, chronic IFN-I signaling induces lipid peroxidation that drives terminal exhaustion of intratumoral CD8+ T cells.

                Oo et al. report an essential role for the lncRNA PCAT19 in the endothelial cell proliferation-quiescence switch. Endothelial cell-enriched PCAT19 is upregulated with quiescence and binds RPA2 to prevent aberrant phosphorylation of RPA2-S33 by ATR kinase. This ensures an appropriate DNA damage response for the endothelial cell-cycle state.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting parental roles shape sex differences in poison frog space use but not navigational performance</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences in spatial abilities.

                The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a step change in the scale of sequencing data, with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth. These sequences reveal key insights when represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus, and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring phylogenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for SARS-CoV-2. We have developed Taxonium, a new tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium links each node to associated metadata and supports mutation-annotated trees, which are able to capture all known genetic variation in a dataset. It can either be run entirely locally in the browser, from a serverbased backend, or as a desktop application. We describe insights that analysing a tree of five million sequences can provide into SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and provide a tool at cov2tree.org for exploring a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Taxonium can be applied to any tree, and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel cis-regulatory element drives early expression of Nkx3.2 in the gnathostome primary jaw joint</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of movable jaws was a major event during vertebrate evolution. The role of NK3 homeobox 2 (Nkx3.2) transcription factor in patterning the primary jaw joint of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) is well known, however knowledge about its regulatory mechanism is lacking. In this study, we report a proximal enhancer element of <i>Nkx3.2</i> that is deeply conserved in most gnathostomes but undetectable in the jawless hagfish and lamprey. This enhancer is active in the developing jaw joint region of the zebrafish <i>Danio rerio</i>, and was thus designated as <i>jaw joint regulatory sequence 1</i> (JRS1). We further show that JRS1 enhancer sequences from a range of gnathostome species, including a chondrichthyan and mammals, have the same activity in the jaw joint as the native zebrafish enhancer, indicating a high degree of functional conservation despite the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fish lineages or the transition of the primary jaw joint into the middle ear of mammals. Finally, we show that deletion of JRS1 from the zebrafish genome using CRISPR/Cas9 results in a significant reduction of early gene expression of <i>nkx3.2</i> and leads to a transient jaw joint deformation and partial fusion. Emergence of this <i>Nkx3.2</i> enhancer in early gnathostomes may have contributed to the origin and shaping of the articulating surfaces of vertebrate jaws.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mandrill mothers associate with infants who look like their own offspring using phenotype matching</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral discrimination of kin is a key process structuring social relationships in animals. In this study, we provide evidence for discrimination towards non-kin by third-parties through a mechanism of phenotype matching. In mandrills, we recently demonstrated increased facial resemblance among paternally related juvenile and adult females indicating adaptive opportunities for paternal kin recognition. Here, we hypothesize that mandrill mothers use offspring’s facial resemblance with other infants to guide offspring’s social opportunities towards similar-looking ones. Using deep learning for face recognition in 80 wild mandrill infants, we first show that infants sired by the same father resemble each other the most, independently of their age, sex or maternal origin, extending previous results to the youngest age class. Using long-term behavioral observations on association patterns, and controlling for matrilineal origin, maternal relatedness and infant age and sex, we then show, as predicted, that mothers are spatially closer to infants that resemble their own offspring more, and that this maternal behavior leads to similar-looking infants being spatially associated. We then discuss the different scenarios explaining this result, arguing that an adaptive maternal behavior is a likely explanation. In support of this mechanism and using theoretical modeling, we finally describe a plausible evolutionary process whereby mothers gain fitness benefits by promoting nepotism among paternally related infants. This mechanism, that we call ‘second-order kin selection’, may extend beyond mother-infant interactions and has the potential to explain cooperative behaviors among non-kin in other social species, including humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular mechanisms underlying central sensitization in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain disorders are often associated with negative emotions, including anxiety and depression. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during central pain development. Prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent development of chronic pain remains unknown. Here, we investigated the cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or chemogenetic inactivation of the somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented the chronification of pain. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that the CeA-SST neurons had increased excitatory synaptic drive and enhanced neuronal excitability in the chronic pain states. Finally, either chemogenetic inactivation of the CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of the nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to the CeA-SST neurons alleviated chronic pain and anxio-depressive symptoms. These data raise the possibility of targeting treatments to CeA-SST neurons to prevent central pain sensitization.

                As a first step in innate immunity, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize distinct pathogen and herbivore-associated molecular patterns and mediate activation of immune responses, but specific steps in the evolution of new PRR sensing functions are not well understood. We employed comparative genomic and functional analyses to define evolutionary events leading to the sensing of the herbivore-associated peptide inceptin (In11) by the PRR Inceptin Receptor (INR) in legume plant species. Existing and <i>de novo</i> genome assemblies revealed that the presence of a functional <i>INR</i> gene corresponded with ability to respond to In11 across ~53 million years (my) of evolution. In11 recognition is unique to the clade of Phaseoloid legumes, and only a single clade of INR homologues from Phaseoloids was functional in a heterologous model. The syntenic loci of several non-Phaseoloid outgroup species nonetheless contain non-functional INR-like homologues, suggesting that an ancestral gene insertion event and diversification preceded the evolution of a specific INR receptor function ~28 mya. Chimeric and ancestrally reconstructed receptors indicated that 16 amino acid differences in the C1 leucine-rich repeat domain and C2 intervening motif mediate gain of In11 recognition. Thus, high PRR diversity was likely followed by a small number of mutations to expand innate immune recognition to a novel peptide elicitor. Analysis of INR evolution provides a model for functional diversification of other germline-encoded PRRs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Channel-independent function of UNC-9/Innexin in spatial arrangement of GABAergic synapses in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Precise synaptic connection of neurons with their targets is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A plethora of signaling pathways act in concert to mediate the precise spatial arrangement of synaptic connections. Here we show a novel role for a gap junction protein in controlling tiled synaptic arrangement in the GABAergic motor neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, in which their axons and synapses overlap minimally with their neighboring neurons within the same class. We found that while EGL-20/Wnt controls axonal tiling, their presynaptic tiling is mediated by a gap junction protein UNC-9/Innexin, that is localized at the presynaptic tiling border between neighboring dorsal D-type GABAergic motor neurons. Strikingly, the gap junction channel activity of UNC-9 is dispensable for its function in controlling tiled presynaptic patterning. While gap junctions are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system as channels, our finding uncovered the novel channel-independent role of UNC-9 in synapse patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosshair, semi-automated targeting for electron microscopy with a motorised ultramicrotome</a></h4>

              
                Volume electron microscopy (EM) is a time-consuming process – often requiring weeks or months of continuous acquisition for large samples. In order to compare the ultrastructure of a number of individuals or conditions, acquisition times must therefore be reduced. For resin-embedded samples, one solution is to selectively target smaller regions of interest by trimming with an ultramicrotome. This is a difficult and labour-intensive process, requiring manual positioning of the diamond knife and sample, and much time and training to master. Here, we have developed a semi-automated workflow for targeting with a modified ultramicrotome. We adapted two recent commercial systems to add motors for each rotational axis (and also each translational axis for one system), allowing precise and automated movement. We also developed a user-friendly software to convert X-ray images of resin-embedded samples into angles and cutting depths for the ultramicrotome. This is provided as an open-source Fiji plugin called Crosshair. This workflow is demonstrated by targeting regions of interest in a series of <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> samples.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patterns of interdivision time correlations reveal hidden cell cycle factors</a></h4>

              
                The time taken for cells to complete a round of cell division is a stochastic process controlled, in part, by intracellular factors. These factors can be inherited across cellular generations which gives rise to, often non-intuitive, correlation patterns in cell cycle timing between cells of different family relationships on lineage trees. Here, we formulate a framework of hidden inherited factors affecting the cell cycle that unifies known cell cycle control models and reveals three distinct interdivision time correlation patterns: aperiodic, alternator and oscillator. We use Bayesian inference with single-cell datasets of cell division in bacteria, mammalian and cancer cells, to identify the inheritance motifs that underlie these datasets. From our inference, we find that interdivision time correlation patterns do not identify a single cell cycle model but generally admit a broad posterior distribution of possible mechanisms. Despite this unidentifiability, we observe that the inferred patterns reveal interpretable inheritance dynamics and hidden rhythmicity of cell cycle factors. This reveals that cell cycle factors are commonly driven by circadian rhythms, but their period may differ in cancer. Our quantitative analysis thus reveals that correlation patterns are an emergent phenomenon that impact cell proliferation and these patterns may be altered in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Promoter sequence and architecture determine expression variability and confer robustness to genetic variants</a></h4>

              
                Genetic and environmental exposures cause variability in gene expression. Although most genes are affected in a population, their effect sizes vary greatly, indicating the existence of regulatory mechanisms that could amplify or attenuate expression variability. Here, we investigate the relationship between the sequence and transcription start site architectures of promoters and their expression variability across human individuals. We find that expression variability can be largely explained by a promoter's DNA sequence and its binding sites for specific transcription factors. We show that promoter expression variability reflects the biological process of a gene, demonstrating a selective trade-off between stability for metabolic genes and plasticity for responsive genes and those involved in signaling. Promoters with a rigid transcription start site architecture are more prone to have variable expression and to be associated with genetic variants with large effect sizes, while a flexible usage of transcription start sites within a promoter attenuates expression variability and limits genotypic effects. Our work provides insights into the variable nature of responsive genes and reveals a novel mechanism for supplying transcriptional and mutational robustness to essential genes through multiple transcription start site regions within a promoter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endocytic trafficking determines cellular tolerance of presynaptic opioid signaling</a></h4>

              
                Opioid tolerance is well described physiologically but its mechanistic basis remains incompletely understood. An important site of opioid action in vivo is the presynaptic terminal, where opioids inhibit transmitter release. This response characteristically resists desensitization over minutes yet becomes gradually tolerant over hours, and how this is possible remains unknown. Here we delineate a cellular mechanism underlying this longer-term form of opioid tolerance in cultured rat medium spiny neurons. Our results support a model in which presynaptic tolerance is mediated by a gradual depletion of cognate receptors from the axon surface through iterative rounds of receptor endocytosis and recycling. For the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), we show that the agonist-induced endocytic process which initiates iterative receptor cycling requires GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail, and that partial or biased agonist drugs with reduced ability to drive phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis in terminals produce correspondingly less presynaptic tolerance. We then show that the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) conforms to the same general paradigm except that presynaptic endocytosis of DOR, in contrast to MOR, does not require phosphorylation of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail. Further, we show that DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR in axons and, consistent with this, that DOR tolerance develops more strongly. Together, these results delineate a cellular basis for the development of presynaptic tolerance to opioids and describe a methodology useful for investigating presynaptic neuromodulation more broadly.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A guide for writing anti-racist tenure and promotion letters</a></h4>

              
                In a two-page tenure letter, senior faculty can make or break a career. This power has an outsized impact on Black academics and other scholars with marginalized identities, who are awarded tenure at lower rates than their white colleagues. We suggest that this difference in tenure rates is due to an implicit, overly narrow definition of academic excellence that does not recognize all the contributions that Black scholars make to their departments, institutions and academia in general. These unrecognized contributions include the (often invisible) burdens of mentoring and representation that these scholars bear disproportionately. Here we propose a set of practical steps for writing inclusive, anti-racist tenure letters, including what to do before writing the letter, what to include (and not include) in the letter itself, and what to do after writing the letter to further support the candidate seeking tenure. We are a group of mostly non-Black academics in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) based in the United States who are learning about and working toward Black liberation in academia; we hope these recommendations will help ongoing efforts to move toward an inclusive academia that appreciates and rewards diverse ways of doing, learning and knowing.

                Viewpoint effects on object recognition interact with object-scene consistency effects. While recognition of objects seen from "accidental" viewpoints (e.g., a cup from below) is typically impeded compared to processing of objects seen from canonical viewpoints (e.g., the string- side of a guitar), this effect is reduced by meaningful scene context information. In the present study we investigated if these findings established by using photographic images, generalise to 3D models of objects. Using 3D models further allowed us to probe a broad range of viewpoints and empirically establish accidental and canonical viewpoints. In Experiment 1, we presented 3D models of objects from six different viewpoints (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300) in colour (1a) and grayscaled (1b) in a sequential matching task. Viewpoint had a significant effect on accuracy and response times. Based on the performance in Experiments 1a and 1b, we determined canonical (0-rotation) and non-canonical (120-rotation) viewpoints for the stimuli. In Experiment 2, participants again performed a sequential matching task, however now the objects were paired with scene backgrounds which could be either consistent (e.g., a cup in the kitchen) or inconsistent (e.g., a guitar in the bathroom) to the object. Viewpoint interacted significantly with scene consistency in that object recognition was less affected by viewpoint when consistent scene information was provided, compared to inconsistent information. Our results show that viewpoint-dependence and scene context effects generalize to depth rotated 3D objects. This supports the important role object-scene processing plays for object constancy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent dysregulation of locus coeruleus firing in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous feature of prodromal Alzheimers disease (AD), and LC neurons degenerate as AD progresses. Tau-mediated LC dysfunction may contribute to early neuropsychiatric symptoms, while loss of LC integrity is associated with conversion to cognitive impairment. Hyperphosphorylated tau alters firing rates in other brain regions, but its effects on LC neurons have not been described. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in firing properties of LC neurons when they are the only cells containing hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as later in disease when {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau pathology is abundant in the forebrain. Single unit LC activity was recorded from anesthetized wild-type (WT) and TgF344-AD rats, which carry the APP/PS1 transgene. Similar to human AD, these rats develop hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC (at 6 months) prior to A{beta} or tau pathology in forebrain regions (at 12-15 months). At baseline, LC neurons from TgF344-AD rats were hypoactive at both ages compared to WT littermates, but showed elevated spontaneous bursting properties, particularly in younger animals. Differences in footshock-evoked LC firing depended on age, with 6-month TgF344-AD rats demonstrating aspects of hyperactivity, and aged transgenic rats showing hypoactivity relative to WT. Tau-induced alterations in LC firing rates may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD, with early hyperactivity associated with prodromal symptoms, followed by hypoactivity contributing to cognitive impairment. These results support further investigation into disease stage-dependent noradrenergic interventions for AD.

                The disruption of cortical assembly activity has been associated with anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. However, information about the relationship between cortical assembly activity and the variations in consciousness associated with natural vigilance states is currently lacking. To address this, we performed vigilance state-specific clustering analysis on 2-photon calcium imaging data from sensorimotor cortex in combination with global EEG microstate analysis derived from multi-EEG signals obtained from widespread cortical locations. Our analysis revealed no difference in the structure of assembly activity during quiet wakefulness (QW), NREMs, or REMs, despite the latter two vigilance states being associated with significantly reduced levels of consciousness relative to QW. However, we found a significant coordination between global EEG microstate dynamics and local cortical assembly activity during periods of QW, but not sleep. These results suggest that the coordination of cortical assembly activity with global brain dynamics could be a key factor of sustained conscious experience.

                Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by pathologic production, aggregation, and cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein that results in impaired cellular function. While neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta express high levels of alpha-synuclein and are highly vulnerable to its aberrant expression or conformation, brain-resident macrophages (microglia) are also sensitive to abnormal alpha-synuclein, with recent reports indicating that elevated levels impair phagocytic ability in vivo and in vitro. To explore the impact of elevated alpha-syn on microglial function we employed a co-culture model containing iPSC-derived neurons and microglia-like cells. iPSCs from healthy control donors and a Parkinson's donor with an allelic triplication of the SNCA gene locus were differentiated into neurons and microglia-like cells. In monoculture, neurons and microglia generated from the SNCA triplication donor expressed higher levels of SNCA transcript and protein. Neurons were found to have significantly greater expression of SNCA compared to microglia, regardless of donor genotype. Co-cultures of neurons and microglia revealed that microglia cultured with SNCA triplication neurons displayed reduction in phagocytosis of fluorescent E. coli, irrespective of microglia donor genotype. SNCA mRNA and protein expression could be reduced with treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting SNCA. ASO treatment partially rescued microglia phagocytosis in SNCA triplication co-cultures and in co-cultures containing SNCA triplication neurons and healthy control microglia. Our results complement and extend previous findings of impaired microglial function in the presence of elevated alpha-synuclein in a novel patient-derived co-culture model that utilizes more disease-relevant conditions rather than the relaying on the addition of exogenous alpha-synuclein.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Food recognition in a blood-feeding insect: characterization of the pharyngeal taste organ</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obligate blood-feeding insects obtain the nutrients and water necessary to ensure survival from the vertebrate blood. The internal taste sensilla, situated in the pharynx, evaluate the suitability of the ingested food. Here, through multiple approaches, we characterized the pharyngeal organ (PO) of the hematophagous kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus to determine its role in food assessment. The PO, located antero-dorsally in the pharynx, comprises 8 taste sensilla that become bathed with the incoming blood. Results: We showed that these taste sensilla house gustatory receptor neurons projecting their axons through the labral nerves to reach the subesophageal zone in the brain. We found that these neurons are electrically activated by relevant appetitive and aversive gustatory stimuli such as NaCl, ATP and caffeine. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the expression of sensory-related gene families in the PO. We identified gustatory receptors, ionotropic receptors, transient receptor potential channels, pickpocket channels, opsins, takeouts, neuropeptide precursors, neuropeptide receptors and biogenic amine receptors. RNA interference assays demonstrated that the pickpocket channel Rproppk014276 is necessary for salt detection during feeding. Conclusion: We provide evidence of the role of the pharyngeal organ in food evaluation. This work shows the first comprehensive characterization of a pharyngeal taste organ in a hematophagous insect.

                Background: Common neural underpinning of Parkinson's Disease (PD) psychosis across different structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies remains unclear to this day with few studies and even fewer meta-analyses available. Objectives: Our meta-analysis aimed to identify and summarise studies using MRI approach to identify PD psychosis-specific brain regions and examine the relation between cortical volume loss and dopaminergic and serotonergic receptor density. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase were searched for MRI studies of PD psychosis (PDP) compared to PD patients without psychosis (PDnP). Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images was applied in the meta-analysis where coordinates were available. Multiple linear regressions to examine the relationship between grey matter volume loss in PDP and receptor gene expression density (extracted from the Allen Human Brain Atlas) were conducted in R. Results: We observed lower grey matter volume in parietal-temporo-occipital regions from our meta-analysis (N studies =10, PDP n=211, PDnP, n=298). These results remained significant after adjusting for PD medications and for cognitive scores. Grey matter volume loss in PDP was associated with local expression of 5-HT1a (b=0.109, p=0.012) and 5-HT2a receptors (b=-0.106, p=0.002) also after adjusting for PD medications (5-HT1a, p = 0.005; 5-HT2a, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Widespread cortical volume loss in the parieto-temporo-occipital regions involved in information processing and integration, as well as attention, could result in PD psychosis symptoms. Neurobiological mechanisms implicating serotonergic receptors may also contribute to this condition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic involvement of premotor and supplementary motor areas in bimanual pinch force control</a></h4>

              
                Many bimanual activities of daily living require quick shifts between symmetric and asymmetric motor output generated by the right and left hand. Bimanual motor control has been mostly studied during continuous repetitive tasks, while little research has been carried out in experimental settings requiring dynamic changes in motor output generated by both hands. Here, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while healthy volunteers performed a visually guided, bimanual pinch force task. This enabled us to map functional activity and connectivity of premotor and motor areas during bimanual pinch force control in different task contexts, requiring mirror-symmetric or inverse-asymmetric changes in discrete pinch force exerted with the right and left hand. The bilateral dorsal premotor cortex showed increased activity and effective coupling to the ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) in the inverse-asymmetric context compared to the mirror-symmetric context of bimanual pitch force control. Compared to unilateral pinches, all bimanual pinch force conditions were characterized by an increased level of activation in the bilateral primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) and stronger coupling from SMA to the ipsilateral M1-HAND. Task-related activity of a cluster in the left caudal SMA scaled positively with the degree of synchronous initiation of bilateral pinch force adjustments, irrespectively of the task context. The results suggest that the dorsal premotor cortex mediates increasing complexity of bimanual coordination by increasing coupling to the SMA-M1 network.

                In this work, we expand the normative model repository introduced in (Rutherford, Fraza, et al., 2022) to include normative models charting lifespan trajectories of structural surface area and brain functional connectivity, measured using two unique resting-state network atlases (Yeo17 and Smith-10), and an updated online platform for transferring these models to new data sources. We showcase the value of these models with a head to head comparison between the features output by normative modeling and raw data features in several benchmarking tasks: mass univariate group difference testing (schizophrenia versus control), classification (schizophrenia versus control), and regression (predicting general cognitive ability). Across all benchmarks, we confirm the advantage (i.e., stronger effect sizes, more accurate classification and prediction) of using normative modeling features. We intend for these accessible resources to facilitate wider adoption of normative modeling across the neuroimaging community.

                The waking brain's ubiquitous alpha oscillations are thought to play an important role in managing the brain's resources, inhibiting neural activity as a function of their phase and amplitude. In accordance with this physiological excitability, perceptual and cognitive processes fluctuate with alpha oscillations. Here we demonstrate that the alpha rhythm can be manipulated with sound in a phase-dependent manner, showing that repeated phase-locked sounds alter the frequency of these oscillations in a spatially localised manner. We draw on oscillator theory to explore the origin of this frequency change, using phase-locked auditory evoked potentials to show a putative phase-reset mechanism, which is dependent on the amplitude of the endogenous alpha oscillations. Finally, we demonstrate the functional relevance of this approach by showing that we can modulate the transition to sleep, using sound, in a phase-dependent manner. Overall, we conclude that the phase of alpha oscillations can be exploited in real time, and highlight alpha phase-locked auditory stimulation as a powerful method by which to both selectively augment and investigate the brain's pertinent oscillations.

                When single cones are stimulated with spots of 543-nm light presented against a white background, subjects report percepts that vary between predominately red, white, and green. However, light of the same spectral composition viewed over a large field under normal viewing conditions looks invariably green and highly saturated. It remains unknown what stimulus parameters are most important for governing the color appearance in the transition between these two extreme cases. The current study varied the size, intensity and retinal motion of stimuli presented in an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Stimuli were either stabilized on target locations or allowed to drift across the retina with the eye's natural motion. Increasing both stimulus size and intensity led to higher likelihoods that monochromatic spots of light were perceived as green, while only higher intensities led to increases in perceived saturation. The data also show an interaction between size and intensity, suggesting that the balance between magnocellular and parvocellular activation may be critical factors for color perception. Surprisingly, under the range of conditions tested, color appearance did not depend on whether stimuli were stabilized or not. Sequential activation of many cones does not appear to drive hue and saturation perception as effectively as simultaneous activation of many cones.

                1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an important non-invasive tool for measuring brain metabolism, with numerous applications in the neuroscientific and clinical domains. In this work we present a new analysis pipeline (SLIPMAT), designed to extract high-quality, tissue-specific, spectral profiles from MR spectroscopic imaging data (MRSI). Spectral decomposition is combined with spatially dependant frequency and phase correction to yield high SNR white and grey matter spectra without partial-volume contamination. A subsequent series of spectral processing steps are applied to reduce unwanted spectral variation, such as baseline correction and linewidth matching, before direct spectral analysis with machine learning and traditional statistical methods. The method is validated using a 2D semi-LASER MRSI sequence, with a 5-minute duration, from data acquired in triplicate across 8 healthy participants. Reliable spectral profiles are confirmed with principal component analysis, revealing the importance of total-choline and scyllo-inositol levels in distinguishing between individuals - in good agreement with our previous work. Furthermore, since the method allows the simultaneous measurement of metabolites in grey and white matter, we show the strong discriminative value of these metabolites in both tissue types for the first time. In conclusion, we present a novel and time efficient MRSI acquisition and processing pipeline, capable of detecting reliable neuro-metabolic differences between healthy individuals, and suitable for the sensitive neurometabolic profiling of in-vivo brain tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-strata co-occurrence of ripples with theta-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus of foraging rats</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivation: Brain rhythms have been postulated to play central roles in animal cognition. A prominently reported dichotomy of hippocampal rhythms, driven primarily by historic single-strata recordings, assigns theta-frequency oscillations (4-12 Hz) and ripples (120-250 Hz) to be exclusively associated with preparatory and consummatory behaviors, respectively. However, due to the differential power expression of these two signals across hippocampal strata, reports of such exclusivity require validation through simultaneous multi-strata recordings and cross-strata analysis of these oscillatory patterns. Methodology: We assessed co-occurrence of theta-frequency oscillations with ripples in multi-channel recordings of extracellular potentials across hippocampal strata from foraging rats. We detected all ripple events from an identified stratum pyramidale (SP) channel based on rigorous thresholds relating to the spectro-temporal and spatial characteristics of ripples. We then defined theta epochs based on theta oscillations detected from each of the different channels spanning the SP to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) through the stratum radiatum (SR). We calculated the proportion of ripples embedded within theta epochs. Results: We found ~20% (across rats) of ripple events (in SP) to co-occur with theta epochs identified from SR/SLM channels, defined here as theta ripples. All characteristics of theta ripples were comparable with ripples that occurred in the absence of theta oscillations. Furthermore, the power of theta oscillations in the immediate vicinity of theta ripples was similar to theta power across identified theta epochs, together validating the identification process of theta ripples. Strikingly, when theta epochs were instead identified from the SP channel, such co-occurrences were significantly lower in number. The reduction in the number of theta ripples was consequent to progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis. We assessed the behavioral state of rats during ripple events and found most theta ripples to occur during immobile periods. We confirmed that across sessions and rats, the theta power observed during exploratory theta epochs was comparable with theta power during immobile theta epochs. In addition, the progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis was common to both exploratory and immobile periods. Finally, we found a strong theta-phase preference of theta ripples within the third quadrant [3{pi}/2-2{pi}] of the associated theta oscillation. Implications: Our analyses provide direct quantitative evidence for the occurrence of ripple events nested within theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus. These analyses emphasize that the prevalent dichotomy about the manifestation of theta-frequency oscillations and ripples needs to be reevaluated, after explicitly accounting for the differential stratum-dependent expression of these two oscillatory patterns. The prevalence of theta ripples expands the potential roles of ripple-frequency oscillations to span the continuum of encoding, retrieval, and consolidation, achieved through interactions with theta oscillations.

                Psilocin, the active compound in Psilocybe sp. mushrooms, is a serotonergic psychedelic that has recently gained renewed interest due to its potential as a therapeutic tool. Despite promising clinical findings, the underlying signaling mechanisms and brain region-specific effects of psilocin and other psychedelic drugs remain unclear. Psilocin, like other psychedelic compounds, is an agonist at many serotonin and other biogenic amine receptors; however, activation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is understood as the main molecular target for the psychoactive effects in animals and humans. 5-HT2ARs are abundantly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the biochemical actions of psilocin on PFC neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, we used in vitro slice electrophysiology to examine how psilocin acutely alters the activity and electrophysiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse PFC. Focal application of psilocin (10uM) onto nonspecified Layer 5 Pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic PFC of C57BL/6J mice produced variable effects on firing (increase, decrease, or no change). 5-HT2AR layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse prelimbic PFC were identified via labeling in a 5-HT2A-ERT2-Cre mouse crossed with an Ai9 tdTomato reporter. Focal application of psilocin increased firing in all identified 5-HT2AR neurons but did not result in any significant changes in synaptic transmission. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocin evokes strong firing changes in the PFC that are 5-HT2AR and Gq dependent, thereby providing valuable insights into the effects of psilocin on a brain region implicated in mediating psychedelic drug actions.

                The complex pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains elusive due to the molecular and cellular dynamics that lead to cognitive impairments and neurological disorders. These complex attributes contribute to the difficulties in the success of TBI therapeutic regimens. Previously, we showed the spatiotemporal effects of TBI as well as the ability of T4 administration to prevent the cognitive impairments induced by TBI. Here, we focus on understanding the mechanism involved in the ability of T4 to prevent the cognitive damage induced by TBI using a systems level approach. Using single cell sequencing of two tissues (hippocampus and frontal cortex) at three stages post injury, we identified astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells to be the most affected across both tissues and across timepoints after T4 treatment. We also identified key genes that were reversed after T4 treatment such as Mbp and Plp1. Oxidative phosphorylation, immune response, and nervous system related pathways were shown to be affected by T4 treatment. Our systems-level approach allows us to further understand the temporal and spatial dynamic reprogramming by T4 that prevents cognitive dysfunction induced by TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When and why grid cells appear or not in trained path integrators</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has claimed that the emergence of grid cells from trained path-integrator circuits is a more fragile phenomenon than previously reported. In this note we critically assess the main analysis and simulation results underlying this claim, within the proper context of previously published theoretical work. Our assessment reveals that the emergence of grid cells is entirely consistent with this prior theory: hexagonal grid cells robustly emerge precisely when prior theory predicts they should, and don't when prior theory predicts they should not.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A method of inferring partially observable Markov models from syllable sequences reveals the effects of deafening on Bengalese finch song syntax</a></h4>

              
                Songs of the Bengalese finch consist of variable sequences of syllables. The sequences follow probabilistic rules, and can be statistically described by partially observable Markov models (POMMs), which consist of states and probabilistic transitions between them. Each state is associated with a syllable, and one syllable can be associated with multiple states. This multiplicity of syllable to states association distinguishes a POMM from a simple Markov model, in which one syllable is associated with one state. The multiplicity indicates that syllable transitions are context-dependent. Here we present a novel method of inferring a POMM with minimal number of states from a finite number of observed sequences. We apply the method to infer POMMs for songs of six adult male Bengalese finches before and shortly after deafening. Before deafening, the models all require multiple states, but with varying degrees of state multiplicity for individual birds. Deafening reduces the state multiplicity for all birds. For three birds, the models become Markovian, while for the other three, the multiplicity persists for some syllables. These observations indicate that auditory feedback contributes to, but is not the only source of, the context dependencies of syllable transitions in Bengalese finch song.

                Functional connectivity (FC) can provide insight into cortical circuit dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, dynamic changes in FC related to locomotion with sensory feedback remain unexplored. To investigate FC dynamics in locomoting mice, we developed mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging with a virtual reality (VR) environment. We find rapid reorganization of cortical FC in response to changing behavioral states. Using machine learning classification, behavioral states are accurately decoded. We then use our VR-based imaging system to study cortical FC in a mouse model of autism and find that locomotion states are associated with altered FC dynamics. Furthermore, we identify FC patterns involving the motor area as the most distinguishing features of the autism mice from wild-type mice during behavioral transitions, which might correlate with motor clumsiness in patients with autism. Our VR-based real-time imaging system provides invaluable information to understand FC dynamics linked to a behavioral abnormality of neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Histopathological studies of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have found newly formed leaky vessels in demyelinated acute and chronic plaques, in addition to blood-brain barrier damage in existing vessels, that exacerbate disease pathology by increasing CNS infiltration of immune cells. However, which vessel subtypes and signaling pathways generate these aberrant vessels is poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo validation, we find that transcriptome signatures of neo-angiogenesis arise in venous endothelial cells in both acute and chronic EAE, and correlate with upregulation in VEGF-A signaling. These neo-angiogenic markers are also increased in human MS lesions. Treatment with a VEGF-A blocking antibody ameliorates EAE pathology by reducing neo-angiogenic transcriptomic signatures in vivo, suggesting that VEGF-A drives angiogenesis from vein ECs in EAE. Our findings suggest novel therapies targeting the vasculature that could benefit chronic MS.

                Deep learning methods trained on brain MRI data from one scanner or imaging protocol can fail catastrophically when tested on data from other sites or protocols - a problem known as domain shift. To address this, here we propose a domain adaptation method that trains a 3D CycleGAN (cycle-consistent generative adversarial network) to harmonize brain MRI data from 5 diverse sources (ADNI, WHIMS, OASIS, AIBL, and UK Biobank; total N=4,941 MRIs, age range: 46-96 years). The approach uses 2 generators and 2 discriminators to generate an image harmonized to a specific target dataset given an image from the source domain distribution and vice versa. We train the CycleGAN to jointly optimize an adversarial loss and cyclic consistency. We use a patch-based discriminator and impose identity loss to further regularize model training. To test the benefit of the harmonization, we show that brain age estimation - a common benchmarking task - is more accurate in GAN-harmonized versus raw data. t-SNE maps show the improved distributional overlap of the harmonized data in the latent space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the properties of the left angular gyrus using TMS-evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Background: The angular gyrus (AG) is involved in numerous cognitive processes, and structural alterations of the AG are reported in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Because abnormal excitability or connectivity of such cortical hubs could precede structural alterations and clinical symptoms, approaches assessing their functional state are needed. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) can provide such functional readouts by probing how the cortex responds to direct stimulation. Objective: To characterize TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) elicited by AG stimulation, determine optimal stimulation parameters, and identify TEP biomarkers of AG function. Methods: In 19 subjects, we recorded AG-TEPs using four TMS orientations and three intensities and compared their spatiotemporal features using topographic dissimilarity and microstate analyses. We also explored the link between AG-TEPs and TMS-evoked muscle activity. Results: Early AG TEP components of interest (P25, N45) showed topographic variability dependent on stimulation parameters. The P25 topography was sensitive to TMS orientation and less to intensity, whereas the N45 topography was highly dependent on both coil orientation and intensity. However, TMS-evoked muscular activity was also dependent on coil orientation and the dominant topography of N45 was strongly related to this muscular activity, indicating that the component may reflect somatosensory-evoked responses to this peripheral activation. Conclusions: The earliest AG TEP component P25 likely reflects neural processes triggered by direct AG activation and could provide an index of local excitability. N45 must be interpreted with caution as it may mostly reflect peripherally evoked activity. Coil orientation can be optimized to minimize muscular contractions.

                The preBotzinger complex of the lower brainstem generates two breathing-related rhythms: one for inspiration on a timescale of seconds, and another that produces larger amplitude sighs on the order of minutes. We hypothesize that these two disparate rhythms emerge in tandem wherein recurrent excitation gives rise to the inspiratory rhythm while a calcium oscillator generates sighs; distinct neuronal populations are not required. We present several mathematical models that instantiate our working hypothesis including: (1) an activity (firing rate) model and (2) a minimal spiking network model. Both modeling frameworks corroborate the single-population rhythmogenic hypothesis.

                Neuronal maturation is a process that plays a key role in the development and regeneration of the central nervous system. Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal neuronal maturation are less understood. Among the mechanisms influencing such neuronal maturation process, apoptosis plays a key role. Several regulators have been described to modulate apoptosis, including post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs. This study aimed to assess whether the strikingly induced miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation contributes to avoiding the neuronal death induced by apoptosis. Our results point out that the observed opposite expression of miR-138-5p and its target Caspase3 might modulate apoptosis favouring neuronal survival at distinct maturation stages. The unchanged expression of miR-138-5p in mature neurons contrasts with the significant downregulation in immature neurons upon apoptotic stimulation. Similarly, immunoblot and individual cellular assays confirmed that during maturation, not only the expression but processing of CASP-3 and caspase activity is reduced after apoptotic stimulation which resulted in a reduction of neuronal death. For all this data, we suggest that the upregulation of miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation is crucial in neuronal survival in pathological or traumatic conditions. Further studies would be needed to determine a more detailed role of miR-138-5p in apoptosis during neuronal maturation and the synergistic action of several microRNAs acting cooperatively on Caspase3 or other apoptotic targets.

                Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), also known as cavernous angiomas, are blood vessel abnormalities comprised of clusters of grossly enlarged and hemorrhage-prone capillaries. The prevalence in the general population, including asymptomatic cases, is estimated to be 0.5%. Some patients develop severe symptoms, including seizures and focal neurologic deficits, while others have no symptoms. The causes of this remarkable presentation heterogeneity within a primarily monogenic disease remain poorly understood. To address this problem, we have established a chronic mouse model of CCM, induced by postnatal ablation of Krit1 with Pdgfb-CreERT. These mice develop CCM lesions gradually over 4-6 months of age throughout of the brain. We examined lesion progression in these mice with T2-weighted 7T MRI protocols. Precise volumetric analysis of individual lesions revealed non-monotonous behavior, with some lesions temporarily growing smaller. However, the cumulative lesional volume invariably increased over time and accelerated after about 3 months. Next, we established a modified protocol for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR imaging and produced quantitative maps of gadolinium tracer MultiHance in the lesions, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity in lesional permeability. Multivariate comparisons of MRI properties of the lesions with cellular markers for endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia revealed that increased cell density surrounding lesions correlates with stability, while increased vasculature within and surrounding lesions may correlate with instability. Our results lay a foundation for better understanding individual lesion properties and provide a comprehensive pre-clinical platform for testing new drug and gene therapies for controlling CCM.

                Schizophrenia disease mechanisms remain poorly understood, in large part due to a lack of valid animal models. Rare heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, encoding a subunit of the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor, greatly increase the risk of schizophrenia. By transcriptomic, proteomic, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and behavioral analysis, we report that heterozygous Grin2a mutant mice show: (i) large-scale gene expression changes across multiple brain regions and in neuronal (excitatory and inhibitory) and non-neuronal cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes); (ii) evidence of reduced activity in prefrontal cortex and increased activity in hippocampus and striatum; (iii) elevated dopamine signaling in striatum; (iv) altered cholesterol biosynthesis in astrocytes; (v) reduction of glutamatergic receptor signaling proteins in the synapse; (iv) heightened gamma oscillation power in EEG; (vi) aberrant locomotor behavioral pattern opposite of that induced by antipsychotic drugs. These findings reveal potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, provide support for both the hypo-glutamate and hyper-dopamine hypotheses of schizophrenia, and underscore the utility of Grin2a-deficient mice as a new genetic model of schizophrenia.

                Predictive processing is quickly gaining ground as a theory of perception and attention. From this perspective the brain is cast as an organism's predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future. However, research on the brain's predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement. The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants' increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power. We discuss the limitations of our study preventing us from replicating previous research, and ways to remedy these shortcomings in future studies.

                We developed a new analytic tool based on visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF) to longitudinally track individual axon bundle transformation following acute optic nerve crush injury (ONC) in mice. We analyzed four parameters: lateral bundle width, axial bundle height, cross-sectional area, and the shape of individual bundles. We showed that axon bundles became wider and thicker at 3-days post ONC. The bundle swelling at 3-days post-ONC has correlated with about 15% retinal ganglion cell (RGC) soma loss. At 6-days post-ONC, axon bundles showed a significant reduction in lateral width and cross-sectional area, followed by a reduction in bundle height at 9-days post-ONC. Bundle shrinking at 9-days post-ONC has correlated with about 68% RGC soma loss. Both experimental and simulated results suggested that the cross-sectional area of individual RGC axon bundles is more sensitive than the bundle width and height to indicate RGC soma loss. This study is the first to track and quantify individual RGC axon bundles in vivo following ONC injury and establish the correlation between the morphological changes of RGC axon bundles and RGC soma loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conscious perception and the role of the basal ganglia: preliminary findings from a deep brain stimulation study</a></h4>

              
                Conscious perception is thought to depend on global amplification of sensory input. In recent years, the basal ganglia have been implicated in gating conscious access due to their consistent involvement in thalamocortical loops. However, much of the evidence implicating the basal ganglia in these processes in humans is correlational. The current study is a preliminary investigation in four patients to explore whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the basal ganglia might improve conscious perception. In our study, treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients with a striatal DBS implant completed two canonical conscious perception tasks: emotion-induced blindness and backward masking. We found preliminary evidence in support of a role played by the basal ganglia in conscious perception at the behavioral level: patients performed better when stimulation was active, but we could not establish neural effects corresponding to these behavioral findings, possibly due to our small sample size. We discuss the potential implications and limitations of our study and delineate avenues for future research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective control of synaptic plasticity in heterogeneous networks through transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) represents a promising non-invasive treatment for an increasingly wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The ability to use periodically oscillating electric fields to non-invasively engage neural dynamics opens up the possibility of recruiting synaptic plasticity and to modulate brain function. However, despite consistent reports about tACS clinical effectiveness, strong state-dependence combined with the ubiquitous heterogeneity of cortical networks collectively results in high outcome variability. Introducing variations in intrinsic neuronal timescales, we explored how such heterogeneity influences stimulation-induced change in synaptic connectivity. We examined how spike timing dependent plasticity, at the level of cells, intra- and inter-laminar cortical networks, can be selectively and preferentially engaged by periodic stimulation. Using computational simulations informed by human experimental data, we analyzed cortical circuits comprised of multiple cell-types, alongside superficial multi-layered networks expressing distinct layer-specific timescales. Our results show that mismatch in neuronal timescales within and/or between cells - and the resulting variability in excitability, temporal integration properties and frequency tuning - enables selective and directional control on synaptic connectivity by tACS. Our work provides new vistas on how to recruit neural heterogeneity to guide brain plasticity using non-invasive stimulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Test-Retest Reliability of Dynamic Functional Connectivity Parameters for a Two-State Model</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) metrics derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) that measure dynamic features of brain communications that change over time are gaining more and more attention. A key concern is the reliability of DFC parameters, especially given the many methodological options. The DFC parameters mean dwell time (MDT), prevalence (Prev.), inter-transition interval (ITI) and state variability (Var.) were computed in 23 participants using a two-state model, sliding window analysis, and two imaging sessions. Reliability of the connectivity states, test-retest reliability of the parameters as well as correlations between DFC parameters were investigated for different scan lengths (i.e., 16 vs 8 min.), atlases (i.e., 116 vs. 442 regions of interest) and with/without within-subject centering of DFC matrices. The results showed an integrated (I) and a segregated (S) brain state with high intra-class correlation (ICC) values of the states between sessions (0.67 [&ge;] ICC [&ge;] 0.99). Reliability of the DFC parameters is, at best, intermediate with an ICC = 0.51 for prevalence for not-centered, 16 min. data and the coarse atlas. Moreover, MDTs of both states were positively correlated for centered data. Prevalence of one state was positively correlated with MDT of the same state and frequently negatively correlated with MDT of the other state. Var was positively correlated with MDT and Prev for the same state and negatively correlated for the other state for not-centered data. This study suggests that prevalence is the most reliable DFC parameter with lower reliability for shorter scans, more atlas regions and centering. Thus, it is advantageous to formulate hypotheses related to brain dynamics in terms of prevalence, especially in small-scale studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of fasting on ischemic infarcts in the rat</a></h4>

              
                Background: Inflammation has been found to be largely detrimental early in the acute phase of stroke but beneficial at more chronic stages. Fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation acutely. We aimed to determine whether post-ischemic fasting improves stroke outcomes through attenuated inflammation. Methods: After an endothelin-1 lesion was created in the striatum, animals were subjected to either normal feeding or water-only fasting for 24 hours. Results: It was found that at 24 hours, fasting reduced infarct volume and BBB breakdown and lowered both circulating and brain neutrophils. Conclusions: These findings suggest that fasting is a potentially beneficial non-pharmacological additive therapeutic option for cerebral ischemia, which might act by reducing inflammation in the acute disease stage.

	<p>The premutation expansion of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome has been linked to a range of clinical and subclinical features. Nearly half of men with FMR1 premutation develop a neurodegenerative disorder; Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). In this syndrome, cognitive executive decline and psychiatric changes may co-occur with major motor features, and in this study, we explored the interrelationships between these three domains in a sample of adult males affected with FXTAS. A sample of 23 adult males aged between 48 and 80 years (mean = 62.3; SD = 8.8), carrying premutation expansions between 45 and 118 CGG repeats, and affected with FXTAS, were included in this study. We employed a battery of cognitive assessments, two standard motor rating scales, and two self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms. When controlling for age and/or educational level, where appropriate, there were highly significant correlations between motor rating score for ICARS gait domain, and the scores representing global cognitive decline (ACE-III), processing speed (SDMT), immediate memory (Digit Span), and depression and anxiety scores derived from both SCL90 and DASS instruments. Remarkably, close relationships of UPDRS scores, representing the contribution of Parkinsonism to FXTAS phenotypes, were exclusive to psychiatric scores. Highly significant relationships between CGG repeat size and most scores for three phenotypic domains suggest a close tracking with genetic liability. These findings of relationships between a constellation of phenotypic domains in male PM carriers with FXTAS are reminiscent of other conditions associated with disruption to cerebro-cerebellar circuits.</p>

	<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation is a novel non-invasive technique for applying repetitive magnetic stimulation to the peripheral nerves and muscles. Contrarily, a person imagines that he/she is exercising during motor imagery. Resting-state electroencephalography can evaluate the ability of motor imagery; however, the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on resting-state electroencephalography are unknown. We examined the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography. The participants were divided into a motor imagery group and motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group. They performed 60 motor imagery tasks involving wrist dorsiflexion movement. In the motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group, we applied repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation to the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle during motor imagery. We measured the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography before and after the task. Both groups displayed a significant increase in the vividness of motor imagery. The motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group exhibited increased &amp;amp;beta; activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by source localization for electroencephalography. Hence, combined motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation changes the resting-state electroencephalography activity and may promote motor imagery.</p>

	<p>Cue reactivity (CR) among smokers exposed to smoking-related stimuli, both proximal (e.g., cigarettes, lighter) and distal (environments, people), has been well-demonstrated. Furthermore, past work has shown that combining proximal smoking cues with smoking environment cues increases cue-provoked craving and smoking behavior above that elicited by either cue type alone. In this pilot study, we examined the impact of combining three personal cues, proximal + environment + people, on subjective and behavioral cue reactivity among smokers. To further understand the impact of this method, we also tested reactivity under the conditions of both smoking satiety and deprivation. In addition, we examined the extent to which cue-induced craving predicted immediate subsequent smoking. Fifteen smokers completed six sessions, of which two focused on the intake and development of personal cues and four involved personal cue reactivity sessions: (1) deprived, smoking cue combination, (2) deprived, nonsmoking cue combination, (3) sated, smoking combination, and (4) sated, nonsmoking cue combination. Cue-provoked craving was greater and smokers were quicker to light a cigarette and smoked more during their exposure to smoking rather than nonsmoking cues and in deprived compared to sated conditions, with no interaction between these variables. While deprived, greater cue-provoked craving in response to smoking cues was correlated with a quicker latency to light a cigarette. This work supports the feasibility of presenting three personal smoking-related combinations of cues within a cue reactivity paradigm and highlights the robust reactivity that this methodology can evoke in smokers.</p>

	<p>For patients with disorders of consciousness, such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients and minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, their long treatment cycle and high cost commonly put a heavy burden on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s family and society. Therefore, it is vital to accurately diagnose and predict consciousness recovery for such patients. In this paper, we explored the role of the P300 signal based on an audiovisual BCI in the classification and prognosis prediction of patients with disorders of consciousness. This experiment included 18 patients: 10 UWS patients and 8 MCS- patients. At the three-month follow-up, we defined patients with an improved prognosis (from UWS to MCS-, from UWS to MCS+, or from MCS- to MCS+) as &amp;amp;ldquo;improved patients&amp;amp;rdquo; and those who stayed in UWS/MCS as &amp;amp;ldquo;not improved patients&amp;amp;rdquo;. First, we compared and analyzed different types of patients, and the results showed that the P300 detection accuracy rate of &amp;amp;ldquo;improved&amp;amp;rdquo; patients was significantly higher than that of &amp;amp;ldquo;not improved&amp;amp;rdquo; patients. Furthermore, the P300 detection accuracy of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients was significantly higher than that of non-traumatic brain injury (NTBI, including acquired brain injury and cerebrovascular disease) patients. We also found that there was a positive linear correlation between P300 detection accuracy and CRS-R score, and patients with higher P300 detection accuracy were likely to achieve higher CRS-R scores. In addition, we found that the patients with higher P300 detection accuracies tend to have better prognosis in this audiovisual BCI. These findings indicate that the detection accuracy of P300 is significantly correlated with the level of consciousness, etiology, and prognosis of patients. P300 can be used to represent the preservation level of consciousness in clinical neurophysiology and predict the possibility of recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness.</p>

However, the question of whether AD-related changes occur in the functional connectivity of the basal ganglia has rarely been specifically analyzed. This study aimed to measure the changes in basal ganglia functional connectivity among patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in their resting state using the functional connectivity density (FCD) value, the functional connectivity (FC) intensity, and the graph theory index, and to confirm their influence on clinical manifestations. (2) Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological data from 48 participants in the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used for analyses. The 48 ADNI participants comprised 16 patients with AD, 16 patients with MCI, and 16 normal controls (NCs). The functional connectivity of basal ganglia was evaluated by FCDs, FC strength, and graph theory index. We compared voxel-based FCD values between groups to show specific regions with significant variation and significant connectivity from ROI conduction to ROI analysis. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analyses between functional connectivity and several simultaneous clinical variables were also conducted. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses associated with classification were conducted for both FCD values and graph theory indices. (3) Results: The level of FCD in patients with cognitive impairment showed obvious abnormalities (including short-range and long-range FCD). In addition to DMN-related regions, aberrant functional connectivity was also found to be present in the basal ganglia, especially in the caudate and amygdala. The FCD values of the basal ganglia (involving the caudate and amygdala) were closely related to scores from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ); meanwhile, the graph theory indices (involving global efficiency and degree) of the basal ganglia (involving the caudate, amygdala, and putamen) were also found to be closely correlated with MMSE scores. In ROC analyses of both FCD and graph theory, the amygdala was of the utmost importance in the early-stage detection of MCI; additionally, the caudate nucleus was found to be crucial in the progression of cognitive decline and AD diagnosis. (4) Conclusions: It was systematically confirmed that there is a phenomenon of change in the functional connections in the basal ganglia during cognitive decline. The findings of this study could improve our understanding of AD and MCI pathology in the basal ganglia and make it possible to propose new targets for AD treatment in further studies.</p>

	<p>Trait-related impulsiveness is highly prevalent in patients with mood disorders, being associated with negative outcomes. The predictive role of affective temperaments on trait-related impulsivity is still understudied. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between impulsivity and affective temperaments in a sample of euthymic patients with mood disorders. This is a real-world multicentric observational study, carried out at the outpatient units of seven university sites in Italy. All patients filled in the short version of Munster Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. The study sample included 653 participants, mainly female (58.2%), with a mean age of 46.9 (&amp;amp;plusmn;14.1). Regression analyses showed that higher levels of trait-related impulsivity were associated to suicide attempts (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.000), the presence of psychotic symptoms during acute phases (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), a seasonal pattern (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), a lower age at onset of the disorder (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), cyclothymic (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and irritable temperaments (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The results of our study highlight the importance to screen patients with mood disorders for impulsivity and affective temperaments in order to identify patients who are more likely to present a worse outcome and to develop personalized and integrated early pharmacological and psychosocial treatment plans. Novelties of the present paper include the recruitment of patients in a stable phase, which reduced possible bias in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; self-reports, and the multicentric nature of the study, resulting in the recruitment of a large sample of patients with mood disorders, geographically distributed across Italy, thus improving the generalizability of study results.</p>

	<p>The functioning of the brain has been a complex and enigmatic phenomenon. From the first approaches made by Descartes about this organism as the vehicle of the mind to contemporary studies that consider the brain as an organism with emergent activities of primary and higher order, this organism has been the object of continuous exploration. It has been possible to develop a more profound study of brain functions through imaging techniques, the implementation of digital platforms or simulators through different programming languages and the use of multiple processors to emulate the speed at which synaptic processes are executed in the brain. The use of various computational architectures raises innumerable questions about the possible scope of disciplines such as computational neurosciences in the study of the brain and the possibility of deep knowledge into different devices with the support that information technology (IT) brings. One of the main interests of cognitive science is the opportunity to develop human intelligence in a system or mechanism. This paper takes the principal articles of three databases oriented to computational sciences (EbscoHost Web, IEEE Xplore and Compendex Engineering Village) to understand the current objectives of neural networks in studying the brain. The possible use of this kind of technology is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can replicate more complex human brain tasks (such as those involving consciousness). The results show the principal findings in research and topics in developing studies about neural networks in computational neurosciences. One of the principal developments is the use of neural networks as the basis of much computational architecture using multiple techniques such as computational neuromorphic chips, MRI images and brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCI) to enhance the capacity to simulate brain activities. This article aims to review and analyze those studies carried out on the development of different computational architectures that focus on affecting various brain activities through neural networks. The aim is to determine the orientation and the main lines of research on this topic and work in routes that allow interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

	<p>In the post-COVID-19 era, significant changes have taken place regarding the epidemic, the economy, family and social life. However, it remains unclear how these changes encompass the psychological symptoms of college students. We carried out a cross-sectional study to investigate anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students from 10 November 2020, to 16 November 2020. The questionnaire included a self-designed canvas, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). Factors associated with psychological symptoms were estimated by ordered and non-conditional logistic regression analysis. Of 4754 participants, 25.0%, 29.7%, 3.4%, 15.3%, 17.1%, and 2.9% reported anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, one, any two, and all three, respectively. In cases with anxiety or depression symptoms, there was a 9.11% comorbidity with PTSD. Factors associated with fears of being infected, social, family, and economic changes increased the risk of psychological symptoms in college students caused by COVID-19. Female college students, identified with anxiety or depression symptoms, were at a lower risk of developing PTSD symptoms (OR, 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43&amp;amp;ndash;0.86). Non-medical majors at university, rural residence, higher educational background, fear of taking public transport, and deterioration of family relationships increased the risk for PTSD symptoms among male respondents with anxiety or depression symptoms due to COVID-19. Factors correlated with psychological symptoms had expanded from the fear of being infected to extensive social, family, and economic changes caused by COVID-19. Therefore, screening and interventions for psychological symptoms should be consistently strengthened and more targeted to college students in the post-COVID-19 era.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have found that statins may play a potential role in the age at onset (AAO) of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD). We performed this Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the association between genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with age at onset of HD. Methods: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMG-CoA reductase associated with LDL cholesterol in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis were used. The summary data of residual AAO of HD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis (n = 9064 HD patients). MR estimates representing lifelong inhibition of drug targets were generated using random-effects inverse-variance weighted analysis. Results: Genetically proxied plasma LDL cholesterol (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.039, 95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.454 to 0.531) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;2.228, 95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;4.830 to 0.374) were not associated with age at onset of HD. Conclusion: The plasma LDL cholesterol levels and the reduction of plasma LDL cholesterol levels by the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (i.e., statins) were not associated with the age of HD onset.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the age of children entering puberty is getting lower and the incidence of central precocious puberty is increasing. It is known that melatonin plays an increasingly important role in regulating animal reproduction, but the specific role and mechanism of melatonin in regulating the initiation of puberty remain unclear. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of subcutaneous melatonin injection on pubertal development in female mice and its mechanism of action. Female mice that were 22 days old received 1 mg/kg doses of melatonin subcutaneously every day for 10, 15 and 20 days. The vaginal opening was checked daily. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain was used to determine the growth of the uterus and ovaries. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone (GnIH), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in serum. By using RT-PCR and Western blotting, the mRNA and protein expression of the hypothalamus GnRH, GnIH, Kisspeptin (Kp), Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), Neuropeptide Y (NPY), as well as G protein-coupled receptor 147 (GPR147) were identified. The findings demonstrated that melatonin could suppress ovarian follicle and uterine wall growth as well as delay vaginal opening, decrease serum levels of GnRH and FSH and increase levels of GnIH. Melatonin increased GnIH and GPR147 expression in the hypothalamus in comparison to the saline group, while decreasing the expression of GnRH, Kisspeptin, POMC, and NPY. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin can inhibit the onset of puberty in female mice by modulating the expression of hypothalamic GnRH, GnIH, Kisspeptin, POMC and NPY neurons and suppressing the hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;gonadal axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Prospective Study of the Impact of Severe Childhood Deprivation on Brain White Matter in Adult Adoptees: Widespread Localized Reductions in Volume But Unaffected Microstructural Organization</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Early childhood neglect can impact brain development across the lifespan. Using voxel-based approaches we recently reported that severe and time-limited institutional deprivation in early childhood was linked to substantial reductions in total brain volume in adulthood, &gt;20 years later. Here, we extend this analysis to explore deprivation-related regional white matter volume and microstructural organization using diffusion-based techniques. A combination of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) analysis and tractography was conducted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from 59 young adults who spent between 3 and 41 months in the severely depriving Romanian institutions of the 1980s before being adopted into United Kingdom families, and 20 nondeprived age-matched United Kingdom controls. Independent of total volume, institutional deprivation was associated with smaller volumes in localized regions across a range of white matter tracts including (1) long-ranging association fibers such as bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), left superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLFs), and left arcuate fasciculus; (2) tracts of the limbic circuitry including fornix and cingulum; and (3) projection fibers with the corticospinal tract particularly affected. Tractographic analysis found no evidence of altered microstructural organization of any tract in terms of hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA), fractional anisotropy (FA), or mean diffusivity (MD). We provide further evidence for the effects of early neglect on brain development and their persistence in adulthood despite many years of environmental enrichment associated with successful adoption. Localized white matter effects appear limited to volumetric changes with microstructural organization unaffected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and Functional MRI Data Differentially Predict Chronological Age and Behavioral Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human cognitive abilities decline with increasing chronological age, with decreased explicit memory performance being most strongly affected. However, some older adults show "successful aging," that is, relatively preserved cognitive ability in old age. One explanation for this could be higher brain-structural integrity in these individuals. Alternatively, the brain might recruit existing resources more efficiently or employ compensatory cognitive strategies. Here, we approached this question by testing multiple candidate variables from structural and functional neuroimaging for their ability to predict chronological age and memory performance, respectively. Prediction was performed using support vector machine (SVM) classification and regression across and within two samples of young (<I>N</I> = 106) and older (<I>N</I> = 153) adults. The candidate variables were (1) behavioral response frequencies in an episodic memory test; (2) recently described functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scores reflecting preservation of functional memory networks; (3) whole-brain fMRI contrasts for novelty processing and subsequent memory; (4) resting-state fMRI maps quantifying voxel-wise signal fluctuation; and (5) gray matter volume estimated from structural MRIs. While age group could be reliably decoded from all variables, chronological age within young and older subjects was best predicted from gray matter volume. In contrast, memory performance was best predicted from task-based fMRI contrasts and particularly single-value fMRI scores, whereas gray matter volume has no predictive power with respect to memory performance in healthy adults. Our results suggest that superior memory performance in healthy older adults is better explained by efficient recruitment of memory networks rather than by preserved brain structure.</p>
