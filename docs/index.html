	<p>The use of metaplasticity-based intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocols including several stimulation blocks could be a possible approach to increasing stimulation effectiveness. Our aim was to investigate the neurophysiological effects of two protocols with a short and a long interval between blocks. Seventeen healthy volunteers received four protocols in a pseudorandomized order: iTBS 0-15 (two blocks of active iTBS of primary motor cortex (M1) separated by 15 min and a control stimulation block of the vertex in 60 min from the first block); iTBS 0-60 (active iTBS, a control block in 15 min, and an active block in 60 min); iTBS 0 (active iTBS and two control blocks with the same intervals); and Control (three control blocks). The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured before the first and after the second and third blocks. We have shown no significant differences between the effects of the protocols on both the motor cortex excitability and the responder rates. No significant changes of MEPs were observed after all the protocols. The reliability for the responsiveness to a single block between two sessions was insignificant. Our data confirm low reproducibility of the response to iTBS and suggest that the use of repeated protocols does not increase the responder rates or neurophysiological effects of iTBS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Theta-Phase Connectivity between Medial Prefrontal and Posterior Areas Underlies Novel Instructions Implementation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Implementing novel instructions is a complex and uniquely human cognitive ability, which requires the rapid and flexible conversion of symbolic content into a format that enables the execution of the instructed behavior. Preparing to implement novel instructions, as opposed to their mere maintenance, involves the activation of the instructed motor plans, and the binding of the action information to the specific context in which this should be executed. Recent evidence and prominent computational models suggest that this efficient configuration of the system might involve a central role of frontal theta oscillations in establishing top-down long-range synchronization between distant and task-relevant brain areas. In the present EEG study (human subjects, 30 females, 4 males), we demonstrate that proactively preparing for the implementation of novels instructions, as opposed to their maintenance, involves a strengthened degree of connectivity in the theta frequency range between medial prefrontal and motor/visual areas. Moreover, we replicated previous results showing oscillatory features associated specifically with implementation demands, and extended on them demonstrating the role of theta oscillations in mediating the effect of task demands on behavioral performance. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that the modulation of connectivity patterns between frontal and task-relevant posterior brain areas is a core factor in the emergence of a behavior-guiding format from novel instructions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Elevated TNF-{alpha} Leads to Neural Circuit Instability in the Absence of Interferon Regulatory Factor 8</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor necessary for the maturation of microglia, as well as other peripheral immune cells. It also regulates the transition of microglia and other immune cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. <I>Irf8</I> is also a known risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, and it has recently been shown to be downregulated in schizophrenia. While most studies have focused on IRF8-dependent regulation of immune cell function, little is known about how it impacts neural circuits. Here, we show by RNAseq from <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> male and female mouse brains that several genes involved in regulation of neural activity are dysregulated. We then show that these molecular changes are reflected in heightened neural excitability and a profound increase in susceptibility to lethal seizures in male and female <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Finally, we identify that TNF-&alpha; is elevated specifically in microglia in the CNS, and genetic or acute pharmacological blockade of TNF-&alpha; in the <I>Irf8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> CNS rescued the seizure phenotype. These results provide important insights into the consequences of IRF8 signaling and TNF-&alpha; on neural circuits. Our data further suggest that neuronal function is impacted by loss of IRF8, a factor involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we identify a previously unknown and key role for interferon regulator factor 8 (IRF8) in regulating neural excitability and seizures. We further determine that these effects on neural circuits are through elevated TNF-&alpha; in the CNS. As IRF8 has most widely been studied in the context of regulating the development and inflammatory signaling in microglia and other immune cells, we have uncovered a novel function. Further, IRF8 is a risk gene for multiple sclerosis and lupus, IRF8 is dysregulated in schizophrenia, and elevated TNF-&alpha; has been identified in a multitude of neurologic conditions. Thus, elucidating these IRF8 and TNF-&alpha;-dependent effects on brain circuit function has profound implications for understanding underlying, therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.</p>

Inhibitory signaling at somatodendritic dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) synapses modulates excitability of dopamine neurons. The neuropeptide neurotensin is expressed by many inputs to the midbrain and induces LTD of D2R synaptic currents (LTD<SUB>DA</SUB>); however, the source of neurotensin that is responsible for LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> is not known. Here we show, in brain slices from male and female mice, that LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> is driven by neurotensin released by dopamine neurons themselves. Optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons was sufficient to induce LTD<SUB>DA</SUB> in the substantia nigra, but not the VTA, and was dependent on neurotensin receptor signaling, postsynaptic calcium, and vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the postsynaptic cell. These findings reveal a novel form of signaling between dopamine neurons involving release of the peptide neurotensin, which may act as a feedforward mechanism to increase dopamine neuron excitability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine neurons in the midbrain play a critical role in reward learning and the initiation of movement. Aberrant dopamine neuron function is implicated in a range of diseases and disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, obesity, and substance use disorders. D2 receptor-mediated PSCs are produced by a rare form of dendrodendritic synaptic transmission between dopamine neurons. These D2 receptor-mediated PSCs undergo LTD following application of the neuropeptide neurotensin. Here we show that release of neurotensin by dopamine neurons themselves is sufficient to induce LTD of dopamine transmission in the substantia nigra. Neurotensin signaling therefore mediates a second form of interdopamine neuron communication and may provide a mechanism by which dopamine neurons maintain excitability when nigral dopamine is elevated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The MAP3Ks DLK and LZK Direct Diverse Responses to Axon Damage in Zebrafish Peripheral Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) dual leucine kinase (DLK) and leucine zipper kinase (LZK) are essential mediators of axon damage responses, but their responses are varied, complex, and incompletely understood. To characterize their functions in axon injury, we generated zebrafish mutants of each gene, labeled motor neurons (MNs) and touch-sensing neurons in live zebrafish, precisely cut their axons with a laser, and assessed the ability of mutant axons to regenerate in larvae, before sex is apparent in zebrafish. DLK and LZK were required redundantly and cell autonomously for axon regeneration in MNs but not in larval Rohon&ndash;Beard (RB) or adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Surprisingly, in <I>dlk lzk</I> double mutants, the spared branches of wounded RB axons grew excessively, suggesting that these kinases inhibit regenerative sprouting in damaged axons. Uninjured trigeminal sensory axons also grew excessively in mutants when neighboring neurons were ablated, indicating that these MAP3Ks are general inhibitors of sensory axon growth. These results demonstrate that zebrafish DLK and LZK promote diverse injury responses, depending on the neuronal cell identity and type of axonal injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The MAP3Ks DLK and LZK are damage sensors that promote diverse outcomes to neuronal injury, including axon regeneration. Understanding their context-specific functions is a prerequisite to considering these kinases as therapeutic targets. To investigate DLK and LZK cell-type-specific functions, we created zebrafish mutants in each gene. Using mosaic cell labeling and precise laser injury we found that both proteins were required for axon regeneration in motor neurons but, unexpectedly, were not required for axon regeneration in Rohon&ndash;Beard or DRG sensory neurons and negatively regulated sprouting in the spared axons of touch-sensing neurons. These findings emphasize that animals have evolved distinct mechanisms to regulate injury site regeneration and collateral sprouting, and identify differential roles for DLK and LZK in these processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Induction of Activity-Dependent Plasticity at Auditory Nerve Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Exposure to nontraumatic noise <I>in vivo</I> drives long-lasting changes in auditory nerve synapses, which may influence hearing, but the induction mechanisms are not known. We mimicked activity in acute slices of the cochlear nucleus from mice of both sexes by treating them with high potassium, after which voltage-clamp recordings from bushy cells indicated that auditory nerve synapses had reduced EPSC amplitude, quantal size, and vesicle release probability (<I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>). The effects of high potassium were prevented by blockers of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and protein kinase A. Treatment with the NO donor, PAPA-NONOate, also decreased <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>, suggesting NO plays a central role in inducing synaptic changes. To identify the source of NO, we activated auditory nerve fibers specifically using optogenetics. Strobing for 2 h led to decreased EPSC amplitude and <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>, which was prevented by antagonists against ionotropic glutamate receptors and NO synthase. This suggests that the activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors in postsynaptic targets of auditory nerve fibers drives release of NO, which acts retrogradely to cause long-term changes in synaptic function in auditory nerve synapses. This may provide insight into preventing or treating disorders caused by noise exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory nerve fibers undergo long-lasting changes in synaptic properties in response to noise exposure <I>in vivo</I>, which may contribute to changes in hearing. Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying induction of synaptic changes using high potassium and optogenetic stimulation <I>in vitro</I> and identified important signaling pathways using pharmacology. Our results suggest that auditory nerve activity drives postsynaptic depolarization through AMPA and NMDA receptors, leading to the release of nitric oxide, which acts retrogradely to regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. These experiments revealed that auditory nerve synapses are unexpectedly sensitive to activity and can show dramatic, long-lasting changes in a few hours that could affect hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Specific Modulation of Slow-Wave Neural Oscillations via Weak Exogeneous Extracellular Fields Reveals a Resonance Pattern</a></h4>

              
                <p>Single neurons often exhibit endogenous oscillatory activity centered around a specific frequency band. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can generate a weak oscillating extracellular field in the brain that causes subthreshold membrane potential shifts that can affect spike timing at the single neuron level. Many studies have now shown that the endogenous oscillation can be entrained when the tACS frequency matches that of the exogenous extracellular field. However, the effect of tACS on the amplitude of the endogenous oscillation has been less well studied. We investigated this by using exogenous extracellular fields to modulate slow-wave neural oscillations in the ketamine anesthetized male Wistar rat. We applied spatially broad extracellular fields of different frequencies while recording spiking activity from single neurons. The effect of the exogenous extracellular field on the slow-wave neural oscillation amplitude (NOA) followed a resonance pattern: large modulations were observed when the extracellular frequency matched the endogenous frequency of the neuron, while extracellular fields with frequencies far away from the endogenous frequency had little effect. No changes in spike-rate were observed for any of the extracellular fields applied. Our results demonstrate that in addition to the previously reported entrainment and Arnold tongue patterns, weak oscillating extracellular fields modulate the amplitude of the endogenous neural oscillation without any changes in spike-rate, and that this modulation follows a frequency-specific resonance pattern.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity often oscillates around specific endogenous frequencies. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a neuromodulation method which biases spike-times and alter endogenous activity. Most tACS studies focus on entrainment effects which occur when tACS and endogenous neural frequencies are matched. In this study we varied the frequency of the applied tACS and investigated its effect on amplitude of the neural oscillation. Our results revealed a resonance pattern where tACS frequencies close to the endogenous frequency caused an increase in neural oscillation amplitude (NOA) specifically at the applied tACS frequency, while applying tACS frequencies farther away caused little or no change in NOA. Furthermore, applying tACS at differing frequencies caused the amplitude of the neural oscillation at the prestimulation endogenous frequency to decrease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Induced Changes in {micro}-Opioid Receptor Signaling in the Midbrain Periaqueductal Gray of Male and Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioids have decreased analgesic potency (but not efficacy) in aged rodents compared with adults; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this attenuated response are not yet known. The present study investigated the impact of advanced age and biological sex on opioid signaling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the presence of chronic inflammatory pain. Assays measuring &micro;-opioid receptor (MOR) radioligand binding, GTPS binding, receptor phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein expression were performed on vlPAG tissue from adult (2&ndash;3 months) and aged (16&ndash;18 months) male and female rats. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Adult males exhibited the highest MOR binding potential (BP) and highest G-protein activation (activation efficiency ratio) in comparison to aged males and females (adult and aged). No impact of advanced age or sex on MOR phosphorylation state was observed. DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition was highest in the vlPAG of adult males compared with aged males and females (adult and aged). vlPAG levels of RGS4 and RGS9-2, critical for terminating G-protein signaling, were assessed using RNAscope. Adult rats (both males and females) exhibited lower levels of vlPAG RGS4 and RGS9-2 mRNA expression compared with aged males and females. The observed age-related reductions in vlPAG MOR BP, G-protein activation efficiency, and cAMP inhibition, along with the observed age-related increases in RGS4 and RGS9-2 vlPAG expression, provide potential mechanisms whereby the potency of opioids is decreased in the aged population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic Control of Forelimb Motor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to perform skilled arm movements is central to everyday life, as limb impairments in common neurologic disorders such as stroke demonstrate. Skilled arm movements require adaptation of motor commands based on discrepancies between desired and actual movements, called sensory errors. Studies in humans show that this involves predictive and reactive movement adaptations to the errors, and also requires a general motivation to move. How these distinct aspects map onto defined neural signals remains unclear, because of a shortage of equivalent studies in experimental animal models that permit neural-level insights. Therefore, we adapted robotic technology used in human studies to mice, enabling insights into the neural underpinnings of motivational, reactive, and predictive aspects of motor adaptation. Here, we show that forelimb motor adaptation is regulated by neurons previously implicated in motivation and arousal, but not in forelimb motor control: the hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons (HONs). By studying goal-oriented mouse-robot interactions in male mice, we found distinct HON signals occur during forelimb movements and motor adaptation. Temporally-delimited optosilencing of these movement-associated HON signals impaired sensory error-based motor adaptation. Unexpectedly, optosilencing affected neither task reward or execution rates, nor motor performance in tasks that did not require adaptation, indicating that the temporally-defined HON signals studied here were distinct from signals governing general task engagement or sensorimotor control. Collectively, these results reveal a hypothalamic neural substrate regulating forelimb motor adaptation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to perform skilled, adaptable movements is a fundamental part of daily life, and is impaired in common neurologic diseases such as stroke. Maintaining motor adaptation is thus of great interest, but the necessary brain components remain incompletely identified. We found that impaired motor adaptation results from disruption of cells not previously implicated in this pathology: hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons (HONs). We show that temporally confined HON signals are associated with skilled movements. Without these newly-identified signals, a resistance to movement that is normally rapidly overcome leads to prolonged movement impairment. These results identify natural brain signals that enable rapid and effective motor adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maturational Indices of the Cognitive Control Network Are Associated with Inhibitory Control in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Goal-directed behavior crucially relies on our capacity to suppress impulses and predominant behavioral responses. This ability, called inhibitory control, emerges in early childhood with marked improvements between 3 and 4 years. Here, we ask which brain structures are related to the emergence of this critical ability. Using a multimodal approach, we relate the pronounced behavioral improvements in different facets of 3- and 4-year-olds' (<I>N</I> = 37, 20 female) inhibitory control to structural indices of maturation in the developing brain assessed with MRI. Our results show that cortical and subcortical structure of core regions in the adult cognitive control network, including the PFC, thalamus, and the inferior parietal cortices, is associated with early inhibitory functioning in preschool children. Probabilistic tractography revealed an association of frontoparietal (i.e., the superior longitudinal fascicle) and thalamocortical connections with early inhibitory control. Notably, these associations to brain structure were distinct for different facets of early inhibitory control, often referred to as motivational ("hot") and cognitive ("cold") inhibitory control. Our findings thus reveal the structural brain networks and connectivity related to the emergence of this core faculty of human cognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The capacity to suppress impulses and behavioral responses is crucial for goal-directed behavior. This ability, called inhibitory control, develops between the ages of 3 and 4 years. The factors behind this developmental milestone have been debated intensely for decades; however, the brain structure that underlies the emergence of inhibitory control in early childhood is largely unknown. Here, we relate the pronounced behavioral improvements in inhibitory control between 3 and 4 years with structural brain markers of gray matter and white matter maturation. Using a multimodal approach that combines analyses of cortical surface structure, subcortical structures, and white matter connectivity, our results reveal the structural brain networks and connectivity related to this core faculty of human cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chemogenetic Disconnection between the Orbitofrontal Cortex and the Rostromedial Caudate Nucleus Disrupts Motivational Control of Goal-Directed Action</a></h4>

              
                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its major downstream target within the basal ganglia&mdash;the rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD)&mdash;are involved in reward-value processing and goal-directed behavior. However, a causal contribution of the pathway linking these two structures to goal-directed behavior has not been established. Using the chemogenetic technology of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs with a crossed inactivation design, we functionally and reversibly disrupted interactions between the OFC and rmCD in two male macaque monkeys. We injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing an inhibitory designer receptor, hM4Di, into the OFC and contralateral rmCD, the expression of which was visualized <I>in vivo</I> by positron emission tomography and confirmed by postmortem immunohistochemistry. Functional disconnection of the OFC and rmCD resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to the cued reward value for goal-directed action. This decreased sensitivity was most prominent when monkeys had accumulated a certain amount of reward. These results provide causal evidence that the interaction between the OFC and the rmCD is needed for motivational control of action on the basis of the relative reward value and internal drive. This finding extends the current understanding of the physiological basis of psychiatric disorders in which goal-directed behavior is affected, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In daily life, we routinely adjust the speed and accuracy of our actions on the basis of the value of expected reward. Abnormalities in these kinds of motivational adjustments might be related to behaviors seen in psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the current study, we show that the connection from the orbitofrontal cortex to the rostromedial caudate nucleus is essential for motivational control of action in monkeys. This finding expands our knowledge about how the primate brain controls motivation and behavior and provides a particular insight into disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder in which altered connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum has been implicated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Correlates Underlying Social-Cue-Induced Value Change</a></h4>

              
                <p>As humans are social beings, human behavior and cognition are fundamentally shaped by information provided by peers, making human subjective value for rewards prone to be manipulated by perceived social information. Even subtle nonverbal social information, such as others' eye gazes, can influence value assignment, such as food value. In this study, we investigate the neural underpinnings of how gaze cues modify participants' food value (both genders) by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the gaze-cuing task, food items were repeatedly presented either while others looked at them or while they were ignored by others. We determined participants' food values by assessing their willingness to pay before and after a standard gaze-cuing training. Results revealed that participants were willing to pay significantly more for food items that were attended to by others compared with the unattended to food items. Neural data showed that differences in subjective values between the two conditions were accompanied by enhanced activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate after food items were attended to. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between the caudate and the angular gyrus precisely predicted the individual differences in the preference shift. Our results unveil the key neural mechanism underlying the influence of social cues on the subjective value of food and highlight the crucial role of social context in shaping subjective value for food rewards in human.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated how social information like others' gaze toward foods affects individuals' food value. We found that individuals more often choose food items that were looked at by another person compared with food items that were ignored. Using neuroimaging, we showed that this increased value for attended to food items was associated with higher brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the caudate and the angular gyrus was associated with individual differences in values for food items that were attended to by others versus being ignored. These findings provide novel insights into how the brain integrates social information into food value and could suggest possible interventions like using gaze cuing to promote healthier food choices.</p>

                <p>Neuronal coherence is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of communication in the brain, where synchronized field potentials coordinate synaptic and spiking events to support plasticity and learning. Although the spread of field potentials has garnered great interest, little is known about the spatial reach of phase synchronization, or neuronal coherence. Functional connectivity between different brain regions is known to occur across long distances, but the locality of synchronization across the neocortex is understudied. Here we used simultaneous recordings from electrocorticography (ECoG) grids and high-density microelectrode arrays to estimate the spatial reach of neuronal coherence and spike-field coherence (SFC) across frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices during cognitive tasks in humans. We observed the strongest coherence within a 2&ndash;3 cm distance from the microelectrode arrays, potentially defining an effective range for local communication. This range was relatively consistent across brain regions, spectral frequencies, and cognitive tasks. The magnitude of coherence showed power law decay with increasing distance from the microelectrode arrays, where the highest coherence occurred between ECoG contacts, followed by coherence between ECoG and deep cortical local field potential (LFP), and then SFC (i.e., ECoG &gt; LFP &gt; SFC). The spectral frequency of coherence also affected its magnitude. Alpha coherence (8&ndash;14 Hz) was generally higher than other frequencies for signals nearest the microelectrode arrays, whereas delta coherence (1&ndash;3 Hz) was higher for signals that were farther away. Action potentials in all brain regions were most coherent with the phase of alpha oscillations, which suggests that alpha waves could play a larger, more spatially local role in spike timing than other frequencies. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the spatial and spectral dynamics of neuronal synchronization, further advancing knowledge about how activity propagates across the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coherence is theorized to facilitate information transfer across cerebral space by providing a convenient electrophysiological mechanism to modulate membrane potentials in spatiotemporally complex patterns. Our work uses a multiscale approach to evaluate the spatial reach of phase coherence and spike-field coherence during cognitive tasks in humans. Locally, coherence can reach up to 3 cm around a given area of neocortex. The spectral properties of coherence revealed that alpha phase-field and spike-field coherence were higher within ranges &lt;2 cm, whereas lower-frequency delta coherence was higher for contacts farther away. Spatiotemporally shared information (i.e., coherence) across neocortex seems to reach farther than field potentials alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Cortical Trigeminal Fields Excitability by Spreading Depolarization Revealed with in Vivo Functional Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spreading depolarization, usually termed cortical spreading depression has been proposed as the pathophysiological substrate of migraine aura and as an endogenous trigger of headache pain. The links between neurovascular coupling and cortical craniofacial nociceptive activities modulated by SD were assessed by combining <I>in vivo</I> local field potential (LFP) recordings in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with functional ultrasound imaging of S1 and caudal insular (INS) cortices of anesthetized male rats. A single SD wave triggered in the primary visual cortex elicited an ipsilateral, quadriphasic hemodynamic and electrophysiological response in S1 with an early phase consisting of concomitant increases of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and LFPs. A transient hypoperfusion was then correlated with the beginning of the neuronal silence, followed by a strong increase of rCBV, whereas synaptic activities remained inhibited.</p>
<p>LFPs and rCBV recovery period was followed by a progressive increase in S1 and INS baseline activities and facilitation of cortical responses evoked by periorbital cutaneous receptive field stimulation. Sensitization of cortical ophthalmic fields by SD was bilateral, occurred with precise spatiotemporal profiles, and was significantly reduced by pretreatment with an NMDA antagonist. Combined high-resolution assessing of neurovascular coupling and electrophysiological activities has revealed a useful preclinical tool for deciphering central sensitization mechanisms involved in migraine attacks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A crucial unsolved issue is whether visual aura and migraine headache are parallel or sequential processes. Here, we show that a single spreading depolarization wave triggered from the primary visual cortex is powerful enough to elicit progressive, sustained increases of hemodynamic and sensory responses to percutaneous periorbital noxious stimuli recorded in S1 and insular ophthalmic fields. Sensitization of cortical ophthalmic fields by SD was bilateral, occurred with precise spatiotemporal profiles, and was significantly reduced by pretreatment with an NMDA antagonist. Combined high-resolution assessing of neurovascular coupling and electrophysiological activities has revealed a useful preclinical tool for deciphering central sensitization mechanisms involved in migraine attacks.</p>

                Background: Digital gangrene is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs usually in middle-aged patients with longer disease duration. Case: Herein we report the case of a 56-year-old man (with no history suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon, diabetes mellitus, smoking, trauma, infection, or chemical exposure), who presented with SLE and digital gangrene was among the first signs. He presented with a one-month history of joint pain, hair loss, photosensitivity, mouth ulcers, malar rash, dyspnea, and digital pain. Physical examination revealed painful and diffuse erythematous skin lesions in the extremities and back, as well as cyanosis in the fingers. We noted lymphocytopenia (600 cells/mm3), and an elevated C-reactive protein (15.1 mg/l) on laboratory tests. Immunological tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with Title 1:400. Pulmonary computed tomography revealed pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary function tests revealed the restrictive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of SLE with lung involvement was retained. The immunological assessment in search of elements in favor of a vascular origin of the patient's skin lesions was negative. Treatment was initiated with 200 mg/day hydroxychloroquine. For dermal and pulmonary involvement, intravenous (IV) pulse therapy was used with methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for three consecutive days monthly) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/month). Calcium blocking agents were also prescribed. However, the lesions did not improve. The patient was given two infusions of rituximab (1 g) at a 14-day interval with a marked improvement of the majority of vasculitis lesions, and a partial improvement of dyspnea. Conclusions: Digital gangrene is a rare complication of late-onset SLE, especially as a primary manifestation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sherlock: an open-source data platform to store, analyze and integrate Big Data for computational biologists [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In the era of Big Data, data collection underpins biological research more than ever before. In many cases, this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself. It requires downloading multiple public databases with various data structures, and in general, spending days preparing the data before answering any biological questions. Here, we introduce Sherlock, an open-source, cloud-based big data platform (https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/) to solve this problem. Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for computational biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management. The Sherlock platform offers a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to enable users to analyze, process, query and extract information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock can handle different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and convert them to a common optimized storage format, for example, the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock’s ability to quickly and efficiently execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files and share datasets between teams. The Sherlock platform is freely available on GitHub, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users can easily and quickly create and work with specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, analytics, integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Serum levels of α1-antitrypsin, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 in Iraqi COVID-19 patients: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: More than half of the individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been found to have high levels of interleukin (IL)-6. A recent report showed that more elevated serum IL-6 level predicts COVID-19 disease severity and patients’ clinical outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the serum levels of α1-antitrypsin (AAT), IL-1β, and IL-6 between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. Methods: During the data collection phase, 90 individuals were enrolled, 45 healthy controls, and 45 patients confirmed with COVID-19 using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at a specialized isolation hospital in Baghdad between November 2021 and March 2022. In this cross-sectional research, venous blood samples were taken, and serum was isolated and stored for quantitative ELISA measurements of AAT, IL-1β, and IL-6 (ELISA). IBM SPSS version 24 was used to analyze the data. Results: This study revealed a significant increase in the serum levels of AAT, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the COVID-19 patients' group compared to the healthy control group with p-values < 0.001 for each of these markers. Conclusions: AAT concentrations were higher during COVID-19; this elevation is essential during infection. IL-1β and IL-6 levels were also elevated during the infection period; however, dysregulated high levels may lead to cytokine release syndrome. Therefore, these three biomarkers can be regarded as diagnostically crucial parameters.

                COVID-19 has been infecting every continent and Indonesia had suffered greatly as it ranked first for confirmed cases in Southeast Asia region with almost 100,000 deaths. We summarized Indonesian population demographic, socio-behavior, multiple government policy and public health interventions contributed to the high mortality. Although the virulence of COVID-19 strain was found to be similar as other countries, it might be inaccurate due to the low amount of sequenced genome and publicly accessible data of the virus’ strain. As Indonesia recorded higher testing number than WHO’s target, there were imbalances of testing capacity between capital cities and remote areas, hence the actual case number would be larger. The availability of healthcare facilities and skilled healthcare workers were also dispersed unequally, causing Indonesian health systems near collapsing. Moreover, individual sense of urgency and hazard of the pandemic were low, as shown by the low compliance of wearing masks and social distancing. Even though Indonesia was unprepared early in the pandemic, currently these systems are being improved. Indonesia has experienced an extensive problem in conquering the pandemic, hence, the country needed a comprehensive approach from the government, citizens, even private sectors to cease the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A rare case of choledochal cyst [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Choledochal cysts are dilated portions of the biliary tract that account for 1% of all benign biliary diseases. It is prevalent among Asian and female populations and the incidence is 1:100,000–150,000. Among the different types, only 15–35% of all choledochal cysts are type IV cysts, with type I being the most common representing 50–80%. Clinical presentation and therapy of biliary cysts (BC) differ depending on the type. Case: We present a case of a 2-year-old male who presented with non-specific symptoms of multiple episodes of vomiting. Laboratory investigations revealed raised alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. His symptoms of acute pancreatitis were resolved with conventional therapy. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed intra and extra-hepatic cystic biliary tree dilatation suggestive of choledochal cyst Type IV A. Conclusions: Choledochal cysts present with clinical features varying with age and anatomical variants and can pose challenges in management that can be addressed by surgery to avoid further complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chromatin accessibility of primary human cancers ties regional mutational processes and signatures with tissues of origin</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oliver Ocsenas, Jüri Reimand</p>

Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are associated with DNA replication timing (RT) and chromatin accessibility (CA), however these observations are based on normal tissues and cell lines while primary cancer epigenomes remain uncharacterised. Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spatial vaccination strategy to reduce the risk of vaccine-resistant variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiyun Zhang, Gabriela Lobinska, Michal Feldman, Eddie Dekel, Martin A. Nowak, Yitzhak Pilpel, Yonatan Pauzner, Baruch Barzel, Ady Pauzner</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the process of global vaccination against a novel virus can be a prolonged one. Social distancing measures, that are initially adopted to control the pandemic, are gradually relaxed as vaccination progresses and population immunity increases. The result is a prolonged period of high disease prevalence combined with a fitness advantage for vaccine-resistant variants, which together lead to a considerably increased probability for vaccine escape. A spatial vaccination strategy is proposed that has the potential to dramatically reduce this risk. Rather than dispersing the vaccination effort evenly throughout a country, distinct geographic regions of the country are sequentially vaccinated, quickly bringing each to effective herd immunity. Regions with high vaccination rates will then have low infection rates and vice versa. Since people primarily interact within their own region, spatial vaccination reduces the number of encounters between infected individuals (the source of mutations) and vaccinated individuals (who facilitate the spread of vaccine-resistant strains). Thus, spatial vaccination may help mitigate the global risk of vaccine-resistant variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive search space pruning in complex strategic problems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ofra Amir, Liron Tyomkin, Yuval Hart</p>

People have limited computational resources, yet they make complex strategic decisions over enormous spaces of possibilities. How do people efficiently search spaces with combinatorially branching paths? Here, we study players’ search strategies for a winning move in a “k-in-a-row” game. We find that players use scoring strategies to prune the search space and augment this pruning by a “shutter” heuristic that focuses the search on the paths emanating from their previous move. This strong pruning has its costs—both computational simulations and behavioral data indicate that the shutter size is correlated with players’ blindness to their opponent’s winning moves. However, simulations of the search while varying the shutter size, complexity levels, noise levels, branching factor, and computational limitations indicate that despite its costs, a narrow shutter strategy is the dominant strategy for most of the parameter space. Finally, we show that in the presence of computational limitations, the shutter heuristic enhances the performance of deep learning networks in these end-game scenarios. Together, our findings suggest a novel adaptive heuristic that benefits search in a vast space of possibilities of a strategic game.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Physical therapists’ use of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Physical therapy (PT) services can be essential for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Maintaining an efficient healthcare service is achieved by ensuring the safety of a well-informed healthcare practitioner. This study aimed to assess the sources of knowledge, attitude, experience, and accessibility to the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the physical therapists working in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to survey on-duty PT practitioners using a web-based questionnaire. Licensed PT practitioners were invited to participate, and a sample of 424 therapists responded. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions covering the demographic data and the following domains: sources of knowledge regarding the pandemic, experience, and attitude of the therapists during the pandemic, and accessibility to the PPE. Results: Around 83% of the participants (352) completed all the survey questions. Governmental websites were the most used source of knowledge (39%). Hand sanitization was implemented by the majority of participants (81%). Participants, mainly males and experienced therapist, were willing to treat COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 complications of prolonged ventilation and immobilization were successfully treated by 91.2% of participants who treated positive cases. About a third of the participants were part of COVID-19 management planning teams or received training to deal with the pandemic. Most of the necessary PPE was adequately accessible during the pandemic. Conclusions: Therapists implemented the recommended hygienic practices and had no problems accessing the necessary PPE. More efforts should target therapists’ education about the social media misleading information and involving the therapists in the pandemic management planning teams.

                Combined retrograde regenerating axon tracing and Smart-Seq2 single-cell sequencing approaches revealed multiple pro-regeneration genes downstream of Pten deletion. Two of these genes, Anxa2 and Mpp1, also presented striking neuroprotection and visual function preservation in a mouse glaucoma model. Additionally, we established the role of tPA-Anxa2-ILK axis in neural repair.

                Seow et al. identify a class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind a conserved epitope on the spike subdomain 1 (SD1) and that are elicited following infection and vaccination. The SD1 epitope is occluded on spike prefusion structures suggesting binding to a conformational state of spike.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Soluble MAC is primarily released from MAC-resistant bacteria that potently convert complement component C5</a></h4>

              
                The Membrane Attack Complex (MAC or C5b-9) is an important effector of the immune system to kill invading microbes. MAC formation is initiated when complement enzymes on the bacterial surface convert complement component C5 into C5b. Although the MAC is a membrane-inserted complex, soluble forms of MAC (sMAC, or terminal complement complex (TCC)) are often detected in sera of patients suffering from infections. Consequently, sMAC has been proposed as a biomarker, but it remains unclear when and how it is formed during infections. Here, we studied mechanisms of MAC formation on different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and found that sMAC is primarily formed in human serum by bacteria resistant to MAC-dependent killing. Surprisingly, C5 was converted into C5b more potently by MAC-resistant compared to MAC-sensitive <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains. In addition, we found that MAC precursors are released from the surface of MAC-resistant bacteria during MAC assembly. Although release of MAC precursors from bacteria induced lysis of bystander human erythrocytes, serum regulators vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu) can prevent this. Combining size exclusion chromatography with mass spectrometry profiling, we show that sMAC released from bacteria in serum is a heterogeneous mixture of complexes composed of C5b-8, up to 3 copies of C9 and multiple copies of Vn and Clu. Altogether, our data provide molecular insight into how sMAC is generated during bacterial infections. This fundamental knowledge could form the basis for exploring the use of sMAC as biomarker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychosis-associated Valine to Leucine mutation in Neuregulin1 disrupts expression of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene network within the hippocampus and alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) form the bulk of the genetic variation contributing to schizophrenia. Currently little is known about how eQTL expression is regulated or how this leads to the underlying cellular pathology. Neuregulin1-ErbB4 signaling plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis and has been implicated in schizophrenia. A psychosis-associated missense mutation in NRG1 (rs74942016) is predicted to impair Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and dendritogenesis, thereby implicating this mode of signaling in the underlying cellular pathology. We generated a transgenic mouse harboring the rs74942016 mutation in nrg1. We investigated the effect of this mutation (V321L in Type III Nrg1) on Nrg1 nuclear signaling. We performed transcriptomic analysis of the mutant dentate gyrus (DG) and identified several developmental processes predicted to be altered compared to wildtype DG. We assessed neurogenesis, cell cycle dynamics, fate commitment, and neuronal maturation in vivo in the mutant neurogenic niche. We found that the V321L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD. RNA sequencing identified cell cycle regulation, differentiation, neurogenesis, and dendritic growth as dysregulated processes in the mutant DG. We experimentally confirmed these predictions. Key nodes along the neurogenesis developmental timeline were found to be disrupted in the mutant DG, resulting in abnormal dendrite morphology and neural fate specification. We found that orthologs of known schizophrenia susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the mutant DG and interacted within a larger network of dysregulated genes in the mutant DG. Importantly, the schizophrenia-associated genes functioned as hubs coordinating this larger network, and the additional nodes within this extended network were functionally linked to known physiological processes and pathways associated with schizophrenia. Thus, our data show that Nrg1 nuclear back signaling is an important regulator of cell proliferation, neuronal specification, and maturation in the adult mouse DG. Loss of Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling due to the V321L mutation disrupts adult neurogenesis and results in dysregulation of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene network.

                The mammalian somatosensory system is comprised of multiple neuronal populations that form specialized, highly organized sensory endings in the skin. The organization of somatosensory endings is essential to their functions, yet the mechanisms which regulate this organization remain unclear. Using a combination of genetic and molecular labeling approaches, we examined the development of mouse hair follicle-innervating low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and explored competition for innervation targets as a mechanism involved in the patterning of their receptive fields. We show that follicle innervating neurons are present in the skin at birth and that LTMR receptive fields gradually add follicle-innervating endings during the first two postnatal weeks. Using a constitutive Bax knockout to increase the number of neurons in adult animals, we show that two LTMR subtypes have differential responses to an increase in neuronal population size: A{delta}-LTMR neurons shrink their receptive fields to accommodate the increased number of neurons innervating the skin, while C-LTMR neurons do not. Our findings suggest that competition for hair follicles to innervate plays a role in the patterning and organization of follicle-innervating LTMR neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of Pulsatile Activities of Arcuate Kisspeptin Neurons in Aging Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                Reproductive senescence is broadly observed across mammalian females, including humans, eventually leading to a loss of fertility. The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is essential for gonad function, is primarily controlled by kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARCkiss), the pulse generator of GnRH. The pulsatility of GnRH release, as assessed by the amount of circulating gonadotropin, is markedly reduced in aged animals, suggesting that the malfunctions of ARCkiss may be responsible for reproductive aging and menopause-related disorders. However, the activity dynamics of ARCkiss during the natural transition to reproductive senescence remain unclear. Herein, we introduce chronic in vivo Ca2+ imaging of ARCkiss in female mice by fiber photometry to monitor the synchronous episodes of ARCkiss (SEskiss), a known hallmark of GnRH pulse generator activity, from the fully reproductive to acyclic phase over 1 year. During the reproductive phase, we find that not only the frequency, but also the intensities and waveforms of individual SEskiss, vary depending on the stage of the estrus cycle. During the transition to reproductive senescence, the integrity of SEskiss patterns, including the frequency and waveforms, remains mostly unchanged, whereas the intensities tend to decline. These data illuminate the temporal dynamics of ARCkiss activities in aging female mice. More generally, our findings demonstrate the utility of fiber-photometry-based chronic imaging of neuroendocrine regulators in the brain to characterize aging-associated malfunction.

                Retrosplenial cortex has been implicated in processing sensory information and spatial learning. Abnormal neural activity in the retrosplenial cortex is found to be associated with psychedelics, as well as in mouse and non-human primate models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, whether the retrosplenial cortex may directly regulate social behaviors remained unclear. In this work, we found that the neural activity of retrosplenial agranular cortex (RSA), a subregion of retrosplenial cortex, was initially activated, then quickly suppressed upon social contact. Interestingly, the up-down phase of RSA neurons is essential for normal social behaviors. We showed that PV-positive GABAergic neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region sent inhibitory projections to RSA. Blockade of the CA1-RSA inhibitory inputs significantly compromised social behavior. Remarkably, enhancing the CA1-RSA inhibitory input was able to rescue defects of social behaviors in a mouse model for ASD. This work not only suggests a neural mechanism for salience processing of social behavior, but also provides a candidate brain region for ASD intervention with neural modulation approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human brain organoid model of maternal immune activation identifies radial glia cells as selectively vulnerable</a></h4>

              
                Maternal immune activation (MIA) during the critical windows of gestation is correlated with long-term neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring, including increased risks for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) derived from the gestational parent is one of the major molecular mediators, by which MIA alters the developing brain. In this study, we established a human three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model of MIA by treating induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dorsal forebrain organoids with a constitutively active form of IL-6, Hyper-IL-6. We validated our model by showing that dorsal forebrain organoids express the molecular machinery necessary for responding to Hyper-IL-6 and activate STAT signaling upon Hyper-IL-6 treatment. RNA sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes, which have been implicated with ASD. Immunohistochemical analysis as well as single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a small increase in the proportion of radial glia cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes in radial glia cells with downregulation of genes related to protein translation in line with data from mouse models of MIA. Additionally, we identified differentially expressed genes not found in mouse models of MIA which might drive species-specific responses to MIA. Together, we establish a human 3D model of MIA, which can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the increased risk for developing disorders such as ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal disparity of action potentials triggered in axon initial segments and distal axons in the neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural population activity determines the timing of synaptic inputs, which arrive to dendrites, cell bodies and axon initial segments (AISs) of cortical neurons. Action potential initiation in the AIS (AIS-APs) is driven by input integration, and the phase preference of AIS-APs during network oscillations is characteristic to cell classes. Distal regions of cortical axons do not receive synaptic inputs, yet experimental induction protocols can trigger retroaxonal action potentials (RA-APs) in axons distal from the soma. We report spontaneously occurring RA-APs in human and rodent cortical interneurons that appear uncorrelated to inputs and population activity. Network linked triggering of AIS-APs versus input independent timing of RA-APs of the same interneurons result in disparate temporal contribution of a single cell to in vivo network operation through perisomatic and distal axonal firing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dorsal Hippocampus To Nucleus Accumbens Projections Drive Reinforcement Via Activation of Accumbal Dynorphin Neurons.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus represents a key structure in the integration of emotional processing, learning and memory, and reward-related behaviors. While the ventral subdivision of the hippocampus (vHPC) is involved in processing emotional values of salient stimuli and goal-directed behaviors, the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) plays a critical role in episodic, spatial, and associative memory. In addition, it has been shown that the dHPC is necessary for context- and cue-associated reward behaviors, including the expression of reward seeking. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central structure in the mesolimbic reward pathway, integrates the salience of aversive and rewarding stimuli and its activity is sufficient to drive aversive and appetitive behaviors. Recent evidence has demonstrated that dHPC[-&gt;]Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) pathway is necessary for the expression of a conditioned place preference. However, despite years of groundbreaking research and identification of direct projections from the dHPC to the NAc, the sufficiency for dHPC[-&gt;]NAC inputs to drive reinforcement and reward-associated behavior remains to be determined. Here using a wide range of complementary and cutting-edge techniques including behavior, in-vivo manipulation using optogenetics, chemogenetics, brain clearing, local field potential, and fiber photometry recordings, we demonstrate that activation of excitatory projections from the CA1 subregion of the dHPC (dCA1) is sufficient to drive reinforcing behaviors. In addition, we provide strong evidence that this reinforcing behavior is driven by 1) a direct projection from the dCA1 to the NAc and 2) enhanced glutamatergic signaling within the NAc. Furthermore, we uncovered that while dCA1 stimulation increases the activity of both enkephalin- and dynorphin-containing medium spiny neurons in the NAc, the selective activity of dynorphin-containing neurons is necessary for the expression of this reinforcing behavior. Our findings shed light on a novel pathway governing reinforcement and further extend the role of the dHPC on reward seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular profiling of a recently-evolved social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Social behaviors are essential for survival and reproduction and vary strongly among individuals, species, and heritable brain diseases. The molecular and cellular bases of this variation are poorly resolved, and discovering them is necessary to understand how neural circuit and behavioral functions-and dysfunctions-vary in social contexts. Here we integrate single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) with comparative genomics and automated behavior analysis to investigate the neurobiology of castle-building, a recently-evolved social, spatial, goal-directed, and repetitive construction behavior in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. We simultaneously control for and analyze two biological variables correlated with castle-building behavior: quivering, a courtship behavior, and relative gonadal mass. We find signatures of building-, quivering-, and gonadal-associated neuronal excitation, gene expression, and neurogenesis in distinct cell populations. Converging lines of evidence support the involvement of estrogen, TrkB, and CCK signaling systems, and specific pallial excitatory neuronal subpopulations, in castle-building behavior. We show additional evidence that castle-building has evolved in part through genomic divergence in a gene module that is selectively expressed in stem-like quiescent radial glial cells (RGCs) lining the ventricular zone of the pallium. This RGC subpopulation exhibits signatures of a building-associated departure from quiescence, which in turn is associated with neuronal rebalancing in the putative fish homologue of the hippocampus. Our work supports an unexpected role for glia and neurogenesis in the evolution of social behavior, and more broadly shows how snRNA-seq can be used to systematically profile the cellular bases of previously unstudied social behaviors in new species systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A truncating mutation of Magel2 in the rat modelled for the study of Schaaf-Yang and Prader-Willi syndromes alters select behavioral and physiological outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Truncating mutations of the maternally imprinted, paternally expressed MAGEL2 gene are the predicted genetic cause of several rare neurodevelopmental disorders including Schaaf-Yang (SYS), Chitayat-Hall and Opitz Trigonocephaly C syndromes. MAGEL2 is also deleted or inactivated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Previous studies in mice have utilized Magel2 gene deletion models to examine the consequences of its absence. In this study, we report the generation, molecular validation, and phenotypic characterization of a novel rat model with a truncating Magel2 mutation generating a mutant peptide sequence more closely modeling variants associated with SYS-causing mutations. Within the hypothalamus, a brain region wherein mouse and human MAGEL2 is paternally-expressed, we demonstrate at the level of transcript and peptide detection that Magel2 in the rat exhibits a paternal, parent-of-origin effect. In the evaluation of behavioral features across several domains, juvenile Magel2 mutant rats display select alterations in anxiety-like behavior and sociability measures. Moreover, the analysis of peripheral organ systems detected alterations in body composition, cardiac structure and function, and breathing irregularities in Magel2 mutant rats. Several of these findings are concordant with reported mouse phenotypes, signifying the conservation of MAGEL2 function across rodent species for specific behavioral outcome measures. We conclude that our comprehensive analysis demonstrating impairments across multiple domains demonstrates the tractability of this model system for the study of truncating MAGEL2 mutations.

	<p>Recovery of motor function following stroke requires interventions to enhance ipsilesional cortical activity. To improve finger motor function following stroke, we developed a movement task with visuomotor feedback and measured changes in motor cortex activity by electroencephalography. Stroke patients performed two types of movement task on separate days using the paretic fingers: a visuomotor tracking task requiring the patient to match a target muscle force pattern with ongoing feedback and a simple finger flexion/extension task without feedback. Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were recorded before and after the two motor interventions. The amplitudes of MRCPs measured from the ipsilesional hemisphere were significantly enhanced after the visuomotor tracking task but were unchanged by the simple manual movement task. Increased MRCP amplitude preceding movement onset revealed that the control of manual movement using visual feedback acted on the preparatory stage from motor planning to execution. A visuomotor tracking task can enhance motor cortex activity following a brief motor intervention, suggesting efficient induction of use-dependent cortical plasticity in stroke.</p>

	<p>Background: Bioactive coils have been used for nearly 20 years to improve aneurysm treatments. Previous studies are inadequate for comparing the efficacy and safety between different coils. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of different coils by comparing the percentage of people with different modified Raymond scale grades, re-rupture rates, and mortality in patients with intracranial aneurysms embolized with different coils. Method: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) containing coils for aneurysm interventional treatment were collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2021. Bayesian network meta-analysis with a randomized or fixed model was performed to compare the efficacy and safety among different bioactive coils and bare platinum coils. Results: We pooled 3362 patients from eight RCTs. No significant differences were found between coils in the proportion of patients with a three-grade classification assessed with the modified Raymond scale immediately after surgery. Hydrogel coils did not show a significant difference in the percentage of patients with a modified Raymond scale grade I postoperatively compared with bare platinum coils (OR, &amp;amp;minus;0.1080; 95% CI, &amp;amp;minus;0.4201&amp;amp;ndash;0.2423), but at follow-up, the percentage of patients with modified Raymond scale grade I was significantly higher with hydrogel coils than with bare platinum coils (OR, 0.4957; 95% CI, 0.0060&amp;amp;ndash;0.9442). There were no statistical differences between these four coils in terms of aneurysm rupture or re-rupture rate and mortality. Conclusion: Though there was no significant difference in the embolization effect between the several coils in the postoperative period, complete embolization was more likely to be achieved with hydrogel coils compared to bare platinum coils at follow-up. There were no significant differences in safety between the several coil materials.</p>

	<p>Due to pandemic-imposed restrictions on lab-based research, we have recently witnessed a flourishing of online studies in experimental psychology, based on the collection of fine behavioral measures such as reaction times (RTs) and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether participants&amp;amp;rsquo; alerting levels may have a different impact on behavioral performance in the online vs. lab setting. In this work we administered online and in-lab the dynamic temporal prediction (DTP) task, which requires an implicit modulation of participants&amp;amp;rsquo; alerting by alternating experimental conditions implying either slower or faster response rates. We then compared data distribution, RTs, accuracy, and time-on-task effects across the adult lifespan between the settings. We replicated online and across the whole age range considered (19&amp;amp;ndash;69 y) all the task-specific effects already found in-lab (both in terms of RTs and accuracy) beyond the overall RTs delay typical of the online setting. Moreover, we found an interaction between the setting and task-specific features so that participants showed slower RTs only in experimental conditions implying a less urgent response rate, while no RTs delay and a slight accuracy increase emerged in faster conditions. Thus, the online setting has been shown to be methodologically sound in eliciting comparable effects to those found in-lab. Moreover, behavioral performance seems to be more sensitive to task-induced alerting shifts in the online as compared to the lab setting, leading to either a heightened or reduced efficiency depending on a faster or slower response rate of experimental conditions, respectively.</p>

	<p>In recent years, there has been debate about the optimal conceptualisation of psychopathology. Structural models of psychopathology have been developed to counter issues, including comorbidity and poor diagnostic stability prevalent within the traditional nosological approach. Regardless of the conceptualisation of psychological dysfunction, deficits in neurocognitive abilities have been claimed to be an aetiological feature of psychopathology. Explorations of the association between neurocognition and psychopathology have typically taken a linear approach, overlooking the potential interactive dynamics of neurocognitive abilities. Previously, we proposed a multidimensional hypothesis, where within-person interactions between neurocognitive domains are fundamental to understanding the role of neurocognition within psychopathology. In this study, we used previously collected psychopathology data for 400 participants on psychopathological symptoms, substance use, and performance on eight neurocognitive tasks and compared the predictive accuracy of linear models to artificial neural network models. The artificial neural network models were significantly more accurate than the traditional linear models at predicting actual (a) lower-level and (b) high-level dimensional psychopathology. These results provide support for the multidimensional hypothesis: that the study of non-linear interactions and compensatory neurocognitive profiles are integral to understanding the functional associations between neurocognition and of psychopathology.</p>

	<p>Devising cooperative or competitive situations is an important teaching strategy in educational practices. Nevertheless, there is still controversy regarding which situation is better for learning. This study was conducted to explore the effects of cooperative and competitive situations on statistical learning, through the alternating serial reaction time (ASRT) task. Individual cooperative and competitive situations were devised in this study, in which individual situation served as the control condition. Ninety recruited participants were randomly assigned to a cooperative, competitive, or individual group to perform the ASRT task. For general learning, cooperative and competitive situations could indeed make learners respond faster, and there was no significant difference in the RT between the cooperative and competitive groups. Moreover, statistical learning was observed in all three groups. An additional analysis of the early stage of the experiment showed that the learning effect of the competitive group was greater than those of the cooperative and individual groups, in terms of statistical learning. However, the final learning effect was not significantly different among the three groups. Overall, the cooperative and competitive situations had a positive impact on learning and enabled the students to acquire approximately the same learning effect in a shorter time period, compared with the individual situation. Specifically, the competitive situation accelerated the statistical learning process but not the general learning process.</p>

	<p>This study was designed to determine the best intervention time (acute, subacute, and chronic stages) for Walkbot robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) rehabilitation to improve clinical outcomes, including sensorimotor function, balance, cognition, and activities of daily living, in hemiparetic stroke patients. Thirty-six stroke survivors (acute stage group (ASG), n = 11; subacute stage group (SSG), n = 15; chronic stage group (CSG), n = 10) consistently received Walkbot RAGT for 30 min/session, thrice a week, for 4 weeks. Six clinical outcome variables, including the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer Assessment (FMA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Mini-Mental State Examination, were examined before and after the intervention. Significant differences in the FMA, BBS, TIS, and MBI were observed between the ASG and the SSG or CSG. A significant time effect was observed for all variables, except for the MAS, in the ASG and SSG, whereas significant time effects were noted for the FMA, BBS, and TIS in the CSG. Overall, Walkbot RAGT was more favorable for acute stroke patients than for those with subacute or chronic stroke. This provides the first clinical evidence for the optimal intervention timing for RAGT in stroke.</p>

	<p>The NLRP inflammasome is a multi-protein complex which mainly consists of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain. Its activation is linked to microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and partial neuronal degeneration. Many neuropsychiatric illnesses have increased inflammatory responses as both a primary cause and a defining feature. The NLRP inflammasome inhibition delays the progression and alleviates the deteriorating effects of neuroinflammation on several neuropsychiatric disorders. Evidence on the central effects of the NLRP inflammasome potentially provides the scientific base of a promising drug target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review elucidates the classification, composition, and functions of the NLRP inflammasomes. It also explores the underlying mechanisms of NLRP inflammasome activation and its divergent role in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, depression, drug use disorders, and anxiety. Furthermore, we explore the treatment potential of the NLRP inflammasome inhibitors against these disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unmasking the cloak of comorbidities in OSA-association and their severity – a prospective observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with high prevalence in the community but highly underreported. It is also seen that a significant number of cases with OSA are associated with various comorbidities. The study objective was to estimate and assess the specific type and proportion of various comorbidities seen in association with OSA and association of severity of OSA with comorbidities. Methods: The study was a hospital-based descriptive study of 85 patients with OSA. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data and Chi-square test was done to find out the association. Results: The most common comorbidity associated with OSA was obesity (60%). Around half of the patients (49.4%) had severe OSA based on Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) scores. Statistically significant association was seen between presence of comorbidities, like diabetes and hypertension, and risk of OSA based on the snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, blood pressure (S.T.O.P) questionnaire. Conclusions: In our study, a significant proportion (73%) of patients with OSA had associated   comorbidities at the time of initial diagnosis. This indicates a delayed diagnosis as OSA is diagnosed only after multiple and irreversible comorbidities have developed. A majority (49%) had a severe OSA on initial presentation. This combination of multiple comorbidities and severe OSA at the time on diagnosis is reflective of a huge problem that is peculiar to OSA at large at a community level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous among Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mental foramen (MF) and its accessories are the important anatomical considerations while placing implants or doing surgical procedures in and around the mandibular premolar region. This study aimed to evaluate the shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous patients among the Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans that were taken between 2015 and 2020 from Riyadh Elm University were retrieved. A total of 180 samples of CBCT (90 dentate and 90 edentulous) were analyzed. Prevalence of different horizontal positions of the mental foramen (P1 to P6) and other additive parameters like the distance from mental foramen to alveolar crest and inferior border of the mandible, along with the mental foramen angle was assessed. The difference in the mental foramen location among dentate and edentulous subjects was assessed. Gender and age variation also was assessed. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Results: The predominant horizontal position is P4 followed by P3 (59 % in males and 63 % in females at P4, and 15 % each in males and females at P3, respectively). The horizontal position of the mental foramen and gender showed a statistical significance difference, especially at the P3B, P5, and P4 positions. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was seen in the mental foramen to the mandibular inferior border of the mandible (MF_MSB) and the width of mental foramen in the transverse section (MFW). Comparison of the mental foramen among dentate and edentulous subjects showed a statistically significant difference. There was a change in the mental foramen with age. Conclusions: Based on the methodology and sample of this study, it can be concluded that the edentulism only reduced the dimension of the mental foramen opening.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of sparsity in low-rank recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elizabeth Herbert, Srdjan Ostojic</p>

Neural population dynamics are often highly coordinated, allowing task-related computations to be understood as neural trajectories through low-dimensional subspaces. How the network connectivity and input structure give rise to such activity can be investigated with the aid of low-rank recurrent neural networks, a recently-developed class of computational models which offer a rich theoretical framework linking the underlying connectivity structure to emergent low-dimensional dynamics. This framework has so far relied on the assumption of all-to-all connectivity, yet cortical networks are known to be highly sparse. Here we investigate the dynamics of low-rank recurrent networks in which the connections are randomly sparsified, which makes the network connectivity formally full-rank. We first analyse the impact of sparsity on the eigenvalue spectrum of low-rank connectivity matrices, and use this to examine the implications for the dynamics. We find that in the presence of sparsity, the eigenspectra in the complex plane consist of a continuous bulk and isolated outliers, a form analogous to the eigenspectra of connectivity matrices composed of a low-rank and a full-rank random component. This analogy allows us to characterise distinct dynamical regimes of the sparsified low-rank network as a function of key network parameters. Altogether, we find that the low-dimensional dynamics induced by low-rank connectivity structure are preserved even at high levels of sparsity, and can therefore support rich and robust computations even in networks sparsified to a biologically-realistic extent.

The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major global public health concern that threatens the ability to control the disease. Whole-genome sequencing as a tool to rapidly diagnose resistant infections can transform patient treatment and clinical practice. While resistance mechanisms are well understood for some drugs, there are likely many mechanisms yet to be uncovered, particularly for new and repurposed drugs. We sequenced 10,228 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) isolates worldwide and determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on a grid of 2-fold concentration dilutions for 13 antimicrobials using quantitative microtiter plate assays. We performed oligopeptide- and oligonucleotide-based genome-wide association studies using linear mixed models to discover resistance-conferring mechanisms not currently catalogued. Use of MIC over binary resistance phenotypes increased sample heritability for the new and repurposed drugs by 26% to 37%, increasing our ability to detect novel associations. For all drugs, we discovered uncatalogued variants associated with MIC, including in the <i>Rv1218c</i> promoter binding site of the transcriptional repressor <i>Rv1219c</i> (isoniazid), upstream of the <i>vapBC20</i> operon that cleaves 23S rRNA (linezolid) and in the region encoding an α-helix lining the active site of Cyp142 (clofazimine, all <i>p</i> < 10<sup>−7.7</sup>). We observed that artefactual signals of cross-resistance could be unravelled based on the relative effect size on MIC. Our study demonstrates the ability of very large-scale studies to substantially improve our knowledge of genetic variants associated with antimicrobial resistance in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human perceptual and metacognitive decision-making rely on distinct brain networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paolo Di Luzio, Luca Tarasi, Juha Silvanto, Alessio Avenanti, Vincenzo Romei</p>

Perceptual decisions depend on the ability to exploit available sensory information in order to select the most adaptive option from a set of alternatives. Such decisions depend on the perceptual sensitivity of the organism, which is generally accompanied by a corresponding level of certainty about the choice made. Here, by use of corticocortical paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol (ccPAS) aimed at inducing plastic changes, we shaped perceptual sensitivity and metacognitive ability in a motion discrimination task depending on the targeted network, demonstrating their functional dissociation. Neurostimulation aimed at boosting V5/MT+-to-V1/V2 back-projections enhanced motion sensitivity without impacting metacognition, whereas boosting IPS/LIP-to-V1/V2 back-projections increased metacognitive efficiency without impacting motion sensitivity. This double-dissociation provides causal evidence of distinct networks for perceptual sensitivity and metacognitive ability in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multivariate phenotype analysis enables genome-wide inference of mammalian gene function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Nicholson, Hugh Morgan, Habib Ganjgahi, Steve D. M. Brown, Ann-Marie Mallon, Chris Holmes</p>

The function of the majority of genes in the human and mouse genomes is unknown. Investigating and illuminating this dark genome is a major challenge for the biomedical sciences. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is addressing this through the generation and broad-based phenotyping of a knockout (KO) mouse line for every protein-coding gene, producing a multidimensional data set that underlies a genome-wide annotation map from genes to phenotypes. Here, we develop a multivariate (MV) statistical approach and apply it to IMPC data comprising 148 phenotypes measured across 4,548 KO lines.
There are 4,256 (1.4% of 302,997 observed data measurements) hits called by the univariate (UV) model analysing each phenotype separately, compared to 31,843 (10.5%) hits in the observed data results of the MV model, corresponding to an estimated 7.5-fold increase in power of the MV model relative to the UV model. One key property of the data set is its 55.0% rate of missingness, resulting from quality control filters and incomplete measurement of some KO lines. This raises the question of whether it is possible to infer perturbations at phenotype–gene pairs at which data are not available, i.e., to infer some in vivo effects using statistical analysis rather than experimentation. We demonstrate that, even at missing phenotypes, the MV model can detect perturbations with power comparable to the single-phenotype analysis, thereby filling in the complete gene–phenotype map with good sensitivity.
A factor analysis of the MV model’s fitted covariance structure identifies 20 clusters of phenotypes, with each cluster tending to be perturbed collectively. These factors cumulatively explain 75% of the KO-induced variation in the data and facilitate biological interpretation of perturbations. We also demonstrate that the MV approach strengthens the correspondence between IMPC phenotypes and existing gene annotation databases. Analysis of a subset of KO lines measured in replicate across multiple laboratories confirms that the MV model increases power with high replicability.

The Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis: an International Consortium (CRyPTIC) presents here a data compendium of 12,289 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> global clinical isolates, all of which have undergone whole-genome sequencing and have had their minimum inhibitory concentrations to 13 antitubercular drugs measured in a single assay. It is the largest matched phenotypic and genotypic dataset for <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> to date. Here, we provide a summary detailing the breadth of data collected, along with a description of how the isolates were selected, collected, and uniformly processed in CRyPTIC partner laboratories across 23 countries. The compendium contains 6,814 isolates resistant to at least 1 drug, including 2,129 samples that fully satisfy the clinical definitions of rifampicin resistant (RR), multidrug resistant (MDR), pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR), or extensively drug resistant (XDR). The data are enriched for rare resistance-associated variants, and the current limits of genotypic prediction of resistance status (sensitive/resistant) are presented by using a genetic mutation catalogue, along with the presence of suspected resistance-conferring mutations for isolates resistant to the newly introduced drugs bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, and linezolid. Finally, a case study of rifampicin monoresistance demonstrates how this compendium could be used to advance our genetic understanding of rare resistance phenotypes. The data compendium is fully open source and it is hoped that it will facilitate and inspire future research for years to come.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of personality traits and engagement factors towards the use of paid stickers in personal communication messages [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The research investigated the personality traits and engagement factors that influence the use of paid stickers in personal communication. The study was driven by the increasing significance of stickers such as emoticons and emojis in online dialogues. The study was hinged on the Theory of the big five personality traits; neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The study tested seven hypotheses to ascertain the effect of personality traits and engagement factors towards the utilization of paid stickers in personal communication. Methods: The research applied the quantitative survey research design, where primary data was collected from respondents that had experience in using emojis and emoticons in their communications. The data was collected from respondents in Bangkok, Thailand using a structured questionnaire between May 14, 2022, and May 31, 2022.    Results: The results from 391 respondents indicated that conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and neuroticism influence perceived enjoyment, while perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have a significant and positive influence on the intention to use paid stickers. Two elements of engagement, interactive engagement, and personal engagement were used to assess the influence of engagement parameters on the behavioral intention to use paid stickers. The intention to employ paid stickers in personal messages was found to be strongly and favorably influenced by these two engagement characteristics. Conclusions: The study recommends that the creators of stickers, emoticons, and emojis should consider user personality features, sticker engagement, sticker simplicity of use, and the personal delight of users in the creative and communication process. The study concludes that perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have a large and favorable impact on the use of paid stickers. The study's main limitation was that it focused on one area of social media. This must be taken into account when applying the findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the anticancer effects of metformin [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metformin is an antihyperglycemic biguanide that is used as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin use helps control T2DM which is one of the many risk factors for cancer and is proposed to have multiple antagonistic actions against cancer cells. The epidemiology of cancers in Saudi Arabia are colorectal cancer (CRC) 14.4%, breast cancer 14.2%, thyroid cancer 10.2%, non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 6.1%, leukemia 6%, and other cancers 49.2%. We would like to assess the anticancer effect of metformin on various types of malignancies.  Methods:  The 266 cancer patients diagnosed in 2018–2019 in King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) were divided into non-diabetic and diabetic cancer patients (with or without metformin).  The data includes age, gender, body mass index (BMI), type of cancer with grades and stages, T2DM, with or without metformin, complications, and fate etc. of each case.  Results: Out of 300, 266 were selected for the analysis. The results showed the statistical significance (p value 0.022) of metformin use on the cancer grade at diagnosis that favorably influences the morbidity/mortality.   Conclusions: Metformin might have an anti-cancer effect on the grade of cancer at the time of diagnosis regardless of its dosage, and this might improve the prognosis of malignancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">New findings on ligand series used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors within the frameworks of molecular docking, molecular quantum similarity and chemical reactivity indices [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus causes an infectious illness named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the Betacoronavirus genus. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has an important role in the viral life cycle and its active site is a very accessible region, thus a potential therapeutic approach may be to target this region to study the inhibition of viral replication. Various preexisting drugs have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and the use of existing antiviral agents may reduce the time and cost of new drug discoveries, but the efficacy of these drugs is limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate a number of ligands used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors to determine the suitability of them for potential COVID-19 treatment. Methods: In this study, we selected a series of ligands used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors such as: abacavir, acyclovir, amprenavir, ascorbic acid vitamin C, azithromycin, baloxavir, boceprevir, cholecalciferol vitamin D, cidofovir, edoxudine, emtricitabine, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. These ligands were analyzed using molecular docking, molecular quantum similarity, and chemical reactivity indices defined within a conceptual density functional theory framework. Results: The analysis of molecular quantum similarity indices on inhibitors showed a high number of differences from a structural point of view. However, they are quite similar in their electronic density, obtaining the highest values in the electronic similarity index. Global and local chemical reactivity indices were analyzed. Conclusions: These studies allowed for the identification of the main stabilizing interactions using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The molecular quantum similarity and chemical reactivity descriptors provide novel insights into these ligands that can be used in the design of new COVID-19 treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Infection-induced membrane ruffling initiates danger and immune signaling via the mechanosensor PIEZO1</a></h4>

              
                ATP secreted by intestinal epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection is upstream of strong inflammation. Tadala et al. show that mechanical detection of bacterial entry into cells by a mechanosensitive plasma membrane channel initiates the immune response via ATP secretion and gene expression, independently of detection of microbial molecules.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Single-neuron models linking electrophysiology, morphology, and transcriptomics across cortical cell types</a></h4>

              
                Integrating and reconciling multimodal cellular datasets has been challenging. Nandi et al. generate models that are robust representations of cellular experiments and cortical cell types defined by electrophysiology, morphology, or transcriptomics. These models causally link between seemingly disparate modalities offering mechanistic hypotheses about cellular phenotypes.

                Rhomboid family proteins, including derlins, play important roles in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Bock et al. show that the rhomboid protease RHBDL4 cleaves aggregation-prone ER-luminal proteins, initiating degradation by an ERAD pathway parallel to Hrd1-dependent retrotranslocation.

Sensitivity to selinexor correlates with functional p53 and is enhanced with nutlin-3a, while resistance is associated with dysregulated AKT-FOXO3 signaling and overcome by combining with MK-2206.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mitochondrial double-stranded RNAs govern the stress response in chondrocytes to promote osteoarthritis development</a></h4>

              
                Kim et al. report that osteoarthritis-eliciting stressors lead to cytosolic and extracellular efflux of mt-dsRNAs, which activates the innate immune system. The elevated expression of mtRNAs in osteoarthritis patients and model mice provides further in vivo support. Removal of cytosolic mtRNAs via autophagy protects chondrocytes from mitochondrial stress.

                Sherlock and Fogg show that the Rhodobacter capsulatus transcriptional factor GafA is a multi-domain protein. The C terminus binds to its own promoter for autoregulation, the central region directly interacts with RNA polymerase via the omega subunit, and the whole protein is required for activation of the virus-like gene transfer agent.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lactate receptor HCAR1 regulates neurogenesis and microglia activation after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the leading cause of death and disability in newborns with the only current treatment being hypothermia. An increased understanding of the pathways that facilitate tissue repair after HI may aid the development of better treatments. Here, we study the role of lactate receptor HCAR1 in tissue repair after neonatal HI in mice. We show that HCAR1 knockout mice have reduced tissue regeneration compared with wildtype mice. Furthermore, proliferation of neural progenitor cells and glial cells, as well as microglial activation was impaired. Transcriptome analysis showed a strong transcriptional response to HI in the subventricular zone of wildtype mice involving about 7300 genes. In contrast, the HCAR1 knockout mice showed a modest response, involving about 750 genes. Notably, fundamental processes in tissue repair such as cell cycle and innate immunity were dysregulated in HCAR1 knockout. Our data suggest that HCAR1 is a key transcriptional regulator of pathways that promote tissue regeneration after HI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative small and long RNA omics analysis of human healing and nonhealing wounds discovers cooperating microRNAs as therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miR), as important epigenetic control factors, reportedly regulate wound repair. However, our insufficient knowledge of clinically relevant miRs hinders their potential therapeutic use. For this, we performed paired small RNA and long RNA sequencing and integrative omics analysis in human tissue samples, including matched skin and acute wounds collected at each healing stage and chronic non-healing venous ulcers (VU). On the basis of the findings, we developed a compendium  (https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna), which will be an open, comprehensive resource to broadly aid wound healing research. With this first clinical, wound-centric resource of miRs and mRNAs, we identified 17 pathologically relevant miRs that exhibited abnormal VU expression and displayed their targets enriched explicitly in the VU gene signature. Intermeshing regulatory networks controlled by these miRs revealed their high cooperativity in contributing to chronic wound pathology characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-516, upregulated in VU, cooperatively suppressed keratinocyte migration and growth while promoting inflammatory response. By combining miR expression patterns with their specific target gene expression context, we identified miRs highly relevant to VU pathology. Our study opens the possibility of developing innovative wound treatment that targets pathologically relevant cooperating miRs to attain higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Positive feedback regulation of frizzled-7 expression robustly shapes a steep Wnt gradient in Xenopus heart development, together with sFRP1 and heparan sulfate</a></h4>

              
                Secreted molecules called morphogens govern tissue patterning in a concentration-dependent manner. However, it is still unclear how reproducible patterning can be achieved with diffusing molecules, especially when that patterning concerns differentiation of thin tissues. Wnt is a morphogen that organizes cardiac development. Wnt6 patterns cardiogenic mesoderm to induce differentiation of a thin tissue, the pericardium, in <i>Xenopus</i>. In this study, we revealed that a Wnt receptor, <i>frizzled-7</i>, is expressed in a Wnt-dependent manner. With a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling, this receptor-feedback appears essential to shape a steep gradient of Wnt signaling. In addition, computer simulation revealed that this feedback imparts robustness against variations of Wnt ligand production and allows the system to reach a steady state quickly. We also found that a Wnt antagonist sFRP1, which is expressed on the opposite side of the Wnt source, accumulates on N-acetyl-rich heparan sulfate (HS). N-acetyl-rich HS concentration is high between the sources of Wnt and sFRP1, achieving local inhibition of Wnt signaling via restriction of sFRP1 spreading. These integrated regulatory systems restrict the Wnt signaling range and ensure reproducible patterning of the thin pericardium.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Isoform-specific mutation in Dystonin-b gene causes late-onset protein aggregate myopathy and cardiomyopathy</a></h4>

              
                Dystonin (<i>DST</i>), which encodes cytoskeletal linker proteins, expresses three tissue-selective isoforms: neural DST-a, muscular DST-b, and epithelial DST-e. <i>DST</i> mutations cause different disorders, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy 6 (HSAN-VI) and epidermolysis bullosa simplex; however, etiology of the muscle phenotype in <i>DST</i>-related diseases has been unclear. Because <i>DST-b</i> contains all of the <i>DST-a</i>-encoding exons, known HSAN-VI mutations could affect both DST-a and DST-b isoforms. To investigate the specific function of DST-b in striated muscles, we generated a <i>Dst-b</i>-specific mutant mouse model harboring a nonsense mutation. <i>Dst-b</i> mutant mice exhibited late-onset protein aggregate myopathy and cardiomyopathy without neuropathy. We observed desmin aggregation, focal myofibrillar dissolution, and mitochondrial accumulation in striated muscles, which are common characteristics of myofibrillar myopathy. We also found nuclear inclusions containing p62, ubiquitin, and SUMO proteins with nuclear envelope invaginations as a unique pathological hallmark in <i>Dst-b</i> mutation-induced cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed changes in expression of genes responsible for cardiovascular functions. In silico analysis identified <i>DST-b</i> alleles with nonsense mutations in populations worldwide, suggesting that some unidentified hereditary myopathy and cardiomyopathy are caused by <i>DST-b</i> mutations. Here, we demonstrate that the Dst-b isoform is essential for long-term maintenance of striated muscles.

                For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, several drug classes with different mechanisms of action are available. Since only a limited set of dosing regimens and drug combinations can be tested in clinical trials, it is currently unclear whether common medication strategies achieve optimal bone mineral density gains or are outperformed by alternative dosing schemes and combination therapies that have not been explored so far. Here, we develop a mathematical framework of drug interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis that unifies fundamental mechanisms of bone remodeling and the mechanisms of action of four drug classes: bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone analogs, sclerostin inhibitors, and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand inhibitors. Using data from several clinical trials, we calibrate and validate the model, demonstrating its predictive capacity for complex medication scenarios, including sequential and parallel drug combinations. Via simulations, we reveal that there is a large potential to improve gains in bone mineral density by exploiting synergistic interactions between different drug classes, without increasing the total amount of drug administered.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Banp regulates DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle in zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                Btg3-associated nuclear protein (Banp) was originally identified as a nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR)-binding protein and it functions as a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, Banp regulates transcription of metabolic genes via a CGCG-containing motif called the Banp motif. However, its physiological roles in embryonic development are unknown. Here, we report that Banp is indispensable for the DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Zebrafish <i>banp</i> mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in developing retina. We found that DNA replication stress and tp53-dependent DNA damage responses were activated to induce apoptosis in <i>banp</i> mutants, suggesting that Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation, chromosome segregation was not smoothly processed from prometaphase to anaphase in <i>banp</i> morphants, leading to a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA- and ATAC-sequencing identified 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif. Interestingly, a DNA replication fork regulator, <i>wrnip1,</i> and two chromosome segregation regulators, <i>cenpt</i> and <i>ncapg</i>, are included in this list. Thus, Banp directly regulates transcription of <i>wrnip1</i> for recovery from DNA replication stress, and <i>cenpt</i> and <i>ncapg</i> for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival by regulating DNA damage responses and chromosome segregation during mitosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SMAD4 and TGFβ are architects of inverse genetic programs during fate-determination of antiviral CTLs</a></h4>

              
                Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an important differentiation factor for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and alters the expression levels of several of homing-receptors during infection. SMAD4 is part of the canonical signaling network used by members of the transforming growth factor family. For this study, genetically-modified mice were used to determine how SMAD4 and TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) participate in transcriptional-programing of pathogen-specific CTLs. We show that these molecules are essential components of opposing signaling mechanisms, and cooperatively regulate a collection of genes that determine whether specialized populations of pathogen-specific CTLs circulate around the body, or settle in peripheral tissues. TGFb uses a canonical SMAD-dependent signaling pathway to down-regulate Eomesodermin (EOMES), KLRG1 and CD62L, while CD103 is induced. Conversely, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> data show that EOMES, KLRG1, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 and CD62L are positively-regulated via SMAD4, while CD103 and Hobit are downregulated. Intravascular staining shows that signaling via SMAD4 promotes formation of terminally-differentiated CTLs that localize in the vasculature. Our data shows that inflammatory molecules play a key role in lineage-determination of pathogen-specific CTLs, and use SMAD-dependent signaling to alter the expression levels of multiple homing-receptors and transcription factors with known functions during memory formation.

                The blood system is supported by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in a specialized microenvironment called the niche. Many different niche cell types support HSPCs, however how they interact and their ultrastructure has been difficult to define. Here we show that single endogenous HSPCs can be tracked by light microscopy, then identified by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) at multiscale levels. Using the zebrafish larval kidney marrow (KM) niche as a model, we followed single fluorescently-labeled HSPCs by light sheet microscopy, then confirmed their exact location in a 3D SBEM dataset. We found a variety of different configurations of HSPCs and surrounding niche cells, suggesting there could be functional heterogeneity in sites of HSPC lodgement. Our approach also allowed us to identify dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) positive ganglion cells as a previously uncharacterized functional cell type in the HSPC niche. By integrating multiple imaging modalities, we could resolve the ultrastructure of single rare cells deep in live tissue and define all contacts between an HSPC and its surrounding niche cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in South Africa and epidemiological characteristics of three variants of concern (Beta, Delta, and Omicron)</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have been key drivers of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves. To better understand variant epidemiologic characteristics, here we apply a model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa, a country that has experienced three VOC pandemic waves (i.e. Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) by February 2022. We estimate key epidemiologic quantities in each of the nine South African provinces during March 2020 to February 2022, while accounting for changing detection rates, infection seasonality, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination. Model validation shows that estimated underlying infection rates and key parameters (e.g. infection-detection rate and infection-fatality risk) are in line with independent epidemiological data and investigations. In addition, retrospective predictions capture pandemic trajectories beyond the model training period. These detailed, validated model-inference estimates thus enable quantification of both the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, that is, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. These findings help elucidate changing COVID-19 dynamics and inform future public health planning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pre-existing chromosomal polymorphisms in pathogenic E. coli potentiate the evolution of resistance to a last-resort antibiotic</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial pathogens show high levels of chromosomal genetic diversity, but the influence of this diversity on the evolution of antibiotic resistance by plasmid acquisition remains unclear. Here, we address this problem in the context of colistin, a ‘last line of defence’ antibiotic. Using experimental evolution, we show that a plasmid carrying the MCR-1 colistin resistance gene dramatically increases the ability of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to evolve high-level colistin resistance by acquiring mutations in <i>lpxC</i>, an essential chromosomal gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Crucially, <i>lpxC</i> mutations increase colistin resistance in the presence of the MCR-1 gene, but decrease the resistance of wild-type cells, revealing positive sign epistasis for antibiotic resistance between the chromosomal mutations and a mobile resistance gene. Analysis of public genomic datasets shows that <i>lpxC</i> polymorphisms are common in pathogenic <i>E. coli,</i> including those carrying MCR-1, highlighting the clinical relevance of this interaction. Importantly, <i>lpxC</i> diversity is high in pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> from regions with no history of MCR-1 acquisition, suggesting that pre-existing <i>lpxC</i> polymorphisms potentiated the evolution of high-level colistin resistance by MCR-1 acquisition. More broadly, these findings highlight the importance of standing genetic variation and plasmid/chromosomal interactions in the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporal analysis of enhancers during mouse cerebellar development reveals dynamic and novel regulatory functions</a></h4>

              
                We have identified active enhancers in the mouse cerebellum at embryonic and postnatal stages which provides a view of novel enhancers active during cerebellar development. The majority of cerebellar enhancers have dynamic activity between embryonic and postnatal development. Cerebellar enhancers were enriched for neural transcription factor binding sites with temporally specific expression. Putative gene targets displayed spatially restricted expression patterns, indicating cell-type specific expression regulation. Functional analysis of target genes indicated that enhancers regulate processes spanning several developmental epochs such as specification, differentiation and maturation. We use these analyses to discover one novel regulator and one novel marker of cerebellar development: Bhlhe22 and Pax3, respectively. We identified an enrichment of <i>de novo</i> mutations and variants associated with autism spectrum disorder in cerebellar enhancers. Furthermore, by comparing our data with relevant brain development ENCODE histone profiles and cerebellar single-cell datasets we have been able to generalize and expand on the presented analyses, respectively. We have made the results of our analyses available online in the Developing Mouse Cerebellum Enhancer Atlas (https://goldowitzlab.shinyapps.io/developing_mouse_cerebellum_enhancer_atlas/), where our dataset can be efficiently queried, curated and exported by the scientific community to facilitate future research efforts. Our study provides a valuable resource for studying the dynamics of gene expression regulation by enhancers in the developing cerebellum and delivers a rich dataset of novel gene-enhancer associations providing a basis for future in-depth studies in the cerebellum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orbitofrontal cortex populations are differentially recruited to support actions</a></h4>

              
                The ability to use information from ones prior actions is necessary for decision-making. While Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been hypothesized as key for inferences made using cue and value-related information, whether OFC populations contribute to the use of information from volitional actions to guide behavior is not clear. Here, we used a self-paced lever-press hold down task in which mice infer prior lever press durations to guide subsequent action performance. We show that activity of genetically identified lateral OFC subpopulations differentially instantiate current and prior action information during ongoing action execution. Transient state-dependent lOFC circuit disruptions of specified subpopulations reduced the encoding of ongoing press durations but did not disrupt the use of prior action information to guide future action performance. In contrast, a chronic functional loss of lOFC circuit activity resulted in increased reliance on recently executed lever press durations and impaired contingency reversal, suggesting the recruitment of compensatory mechanisms that resulted in repetitive action control. Our results identify a novel role for lOFC in the integration of action information to guide adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF stimulates the retrograde pathway for axonal autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway important for neuronal development, function, and survival. But how autophagy in axons is regulated by neurotrophins to impact neuronal viability and function is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the regulation of axonal autophagy by the neurotrophin BDNF, and elucidate whether autophagosomes carry BDNF-mediated signaling information. We find that BDNF induces autophagic flux in primary neurons by stimulating the retrograde pathway for autophagy in axons. We observed an increase in autophagosome density and retrograde flux in axons, and a corresponding increase in autophagosome density in the soma. However, we find little evidence of autophagosomes co-migrating with BDNF. In contrast, BDNF effectively engages its cognate receptor TrkB to undergo retrograde transport in the axon. These compartments, however, are distinct from LC3-positive autophagic organelles in the axon. Together, we find that BDNF stimulates autophagy in the axon, but retrograde autophagosomes do not appear to carry neurotrophin-based signaling information. Thus, BDNF likely stimulates autophagy as a consequence of BDNF-induced processes that require canonical roles for autophagy in degradation, rather than unconventional roles in neurotrophin signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ADAMTS2 regulates radial neuronal migration by activating TGF-β signaling at the subplate layer of the developing neocortex</a></h4>

              
                During the development of the mammalian brain, neocortical structures are formed by the sequential radial migration of newborn excitatory neurons. The early migrating neurons exhibit a multipolar shape, but they undergo a multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the subplate (SP) layer, where extracellular matrix (ECM) components are abundantly expressed. In this study, we revealed that the TGF-{beta} signaling-related ECM proteins, such as latent TGF-{beta}-binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and fibrillin 2, and TGF-{beta} receptor II (TGF-{beta}RII) and its downstream effector, p-smad2/3, are selectively expressed at the SP layer, suggesting that TGF-{beta} is sequestered in a latent form by forming complexes with these ECM components and then its signaling is activated by ECM remodeling. We found that the migrating multipolar neurons transiently express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 2 (ADAMTS2), an ECM metalloproteinase, just below the SP layer. Knockdown and knockout of Adamts2 suppressed the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons, and therefore, disturbed radial migration. Similar phenotypes were observed by the perturbation of TGF-{beta} signaling in the migrating neurons. Time-lapse luminescence imaging of TGF-{beta} signaling indicated that ADAMTS2 activates this signaling pathway in the migrating neurons during the multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the SP layer. These results suggest that the ADAMTS2 secreted by the migrating multipolar neurons activates TGF-{beta} signaling by ECM remodeling of the SP layer, leading to the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. We propose that the SP layer plays an essential role in the radial neuronal migration as a signaling center of the developing neocortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The delta-opioid receptor bidirectionally modulates itch</a></h4>

              
                Opioid signaling has been shown to be critically important in the neuromodulation of sensory circuits in the superficial spinal cord. Agonists of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) elicit itch, whereas agonists of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) have been shown to inhibit itch. Despite the clear roles of MOR and KOR for the modulation itch, whether the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) is involved in the regulation of itch remained unknown. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of DOR agonists suppresses chemical itch and that intrathecal application of DOR antagonists is sufficient to evoke itch. We identify that spinal enkephalin neurons co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY), a peptide previously implicated in the inhibition of itch. In the spinal cord, DOR overlapped with both the NPY receptor (NPY1R) and KOR, suggesting that DOR neurons represent a site for convergent itch information in the dorsal horn. Lastly, we found that neurons co-expressing DOR and KOR showed significant Fos induction following pruritogen-evoked itch. These results uncover a role for DOR in the modulation of itch in the superficial dorsal horn.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional Neuroligin-2-MDGA1 interactions differentially regulate synaptic GABAARs and cytosolic gephyrin aggregation</a></h4>

              
                The function of GABAergic synapses is critically shaped by cell adhesion proteins that recruit GABAARs to synapses and mediate transsynaptic signalling, but the synapse-type-specific function of such synaptic adhesion proteins and their mutual interaction remain incompletely understood. A ubiquitous cell adhesion protein at GABAergic synapses is Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), which recruits synaptic GABAARs by promoting the assembly of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold. While Nlgn2 is present at virtually all GABAergic synapses throughout the forebrain, its loss affects different GABAergic synapse subtypes with different severity, indicating that synapse-specific interactors and synapse-organizer-redundancies define the function of Nlgn2 for a given synapse type. Here we investigated how Nlgn2 function at GABAergic synapses in mouse hippocampal area CA1 is modulated by two recently identified interaction partners, MDGA1 and MDGA2. We show that Nlgn2 and MDGA1 colocalize most prominently in the stratum radiatum (S.R.) of area CA1, and that combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion causes a layer-specific exacerbation of the loss of gephyrin puncta in layer S.R. seen following Nlgn2 deletion. Intriguingly, combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion concurrently ameliorates the abnormal cytosolic gephyrin aggregation, the reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission and the exacerbated anxiety behavior seen in Nlgn2 knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, heterozygous deletion of MDGA2 in Nlgn2 KO mice has only minor effects on gephyrin and GABAAR puncta and does not normalize cytosolic gephyrin aggregates, inhibitory synaptic transmission or anxiety-related behavior. Our data indicate that MDGA1, but not MDGA2, modulates Nlgn2 function, primarily by regulating the formation of cytosolic gephyrin aggregates. Given that both Nlgn2 and the MDGA family of proteins have been linked to psychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, our data lead to the notion that abnormal gephyrin aggregation may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders, and that intervention with gephyrin aggregation could present a novel therapeutic strategy.

                Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is essential for effective motor control. Because proprioceptive sensory neurons are embedded in complex and dynamic tissues, it has been challenging to understand how they sense and encode mechanical stimuli. Here, we find that proprioceptor neurons in the Drosophila femur are organized into functional groups that are biomechanically specialized to detect features of tibia joint kinematics. The dendrites of position and vibration-tuned proprioceptors receive distinct mechanical signals via the arculum, an elegant mechanical structure that decomposes movement of the tibia joint into orthogonal components. The cell bodies of position-tuned proprioceptors form a goniotopic map of joint angle, whereas the dendrites of vibration-tuned proprioceptors form a tonotopic map of tibia vibration frequency. Our findings reveal biomechanical mechanisms that underlie proprioceptor feature selectivity and identify common organizational principles between proprioception and other topographically organized sensory systems.
