                <p>by Karim G. Habashy, Benjamin D. Evans, Dan F. M. Goodman, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons.

                <p>by Pengyu Liu, Jacob Lusk, Nataša Jonoska, Mariel Vázquez</p>

R-loops are a class of non-canonical nucleic acid structures that typically form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes the DNA template strand, leaving the non-template DNA strand unpaired. These structures are abundant in nature and play important physiological and pathological roles. Recent research shows that DNA sequence and topology affect R-loops, yet it remains unclear how these and other factors contribute to R-loop formation. In this work, we investigate the link between nascent RNA folding and the formation of R-loops. We introduce tree-polynomials, a new class of representations of RNA secondary structures. A tree-polynomial representation consists of a rooted tree associated with an RNA secondary structure together with a polynomial that is uniquely identified with the rooted tree. Tree-polynomials enable accurate, interpretable and efficient data analysis of RNA secondary structures without pseudoknots. We develop a computational pipeline for investigating and predicting R-loop formation from a genomic sequence. The pipeline obtains nascent RNA secondary structures from a co-transcriptional RNA folding software, and computes the tree-polynomial representations of the structures. By applying this pipeline to plasmid sequences that contain R-loop forming genes, we establish a strong correlation between the coefficient sums of tree-polynomials and the experimental probability of R-loop formation. Such strong correlation indicates that the pipeline can be used for accurate R-loop prediction. Furthermore, the interpretability of tree-polynomials allows us to characterize the features of RNA secondary structure associated with R-loop formation. In particular, we identify that branches with short stems separated by bulges and interior loops are associated with R-loops.

In the era of precision medicine, it is necessary to understand heterogeneity among patients with complex diseases to improve personalized prevention and management strategies. Here, we introduce ClustAll, a Bioconductor package designed for unsupervised patient stratification using clinical data. ClustAll is based on the previously validated methodology ClustAll, a clustering framework that effectively handles intricacies in clinical data, including mixed data types, missing values, and collinearity. Additionally, ClustAll stands out in its ability to identify multiple patient stratifications within the same population while ensuring their robustness. The updated implementation of ClustAll features S4 classes, parallel computing for enhanced computational efficiency, and user-friendly tools for exploring and comparing stratifications against clinical phenotypes. The performance of ClustAll has been validated using two public clinical datasets, confirming its effectiveness in patient stratification and highlighting its potential impact on clinical management. In summary, ClustAll is a powerful tool for patient stratification in personalized medicine.

                <p>by Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Riasat Khan</p>

Mosquito-related diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, necessitating efficient and accurate mosquito classification for effective surveillance and control. This work presents an innovative approach to mosquito classification by leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers and open-set learning techniques. A novel framework has been introduced that integrates Transformer-based deep learning models with comprehensive data augmentation and preprocessing methods, enabling robust and precise identification of ten mosquito species. The Swin Transformer model achieves the best performance for traditional closed-set learning with 99.60% accuracy and 0.996 F1 score. The lightweight MobileViT technique attains an almost equivalent accuracy of 98.90% with significantly reduced parameters and model complexities. Next, the applied deep learning models’ adaptability and generalizability in a static environment have been enhanced by using new classes of data samples during the inference stage that have not been included in the training set. The proposed framework’s ability to handle unseen classes like insects similar to mosquitoes, even humans, through open-set learning further enhances its practical applicability employing the OpenMax technique and Weibull distribution. The traditional CNN model, Xception, outperforms the latest transformer with higher accuracy and F1 score for open-set learning. The study’s findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced deep-learning architectures in entomology, providing a strong groundwork for future research and development in mosquito surveillance and vector control. The implications of this work extend beyond mosquito classification, offering valuable insights for broader ecological and environmental monitoring applications.

                <p>by Emine Celiker, Charlie Woodrow, Òscar Guadayol, Leonidas-Romanos Davranoglou, Christian M. Schlepütz, Beth Mortimer, Graham K. Taylor, Stuart Humphries, Fernando Montealegre-Z</p>

Mammalian hearing operates on three basic steps: 1) sound capturing, 2) impedance conversion, and 3) frequency analysis. While these canonical steps are vital for acoustic communication and survival in mammals, they are not unique to them. An equivalent mechanism has been described for katydids (Insecta), and it is unique to this group among invertebrates. The katydid inner ear resembles an uncoiled cochlea, and has a length less than 1 mm. Their inner ears contain a hearing organ, <i>crista acustica</i>, which holds tonotopically arranged sensory cells for frequency mapping via travelling waves. The <i>crista acustica</i> is located on a curved triangular surface formed by the dorsal wall of the ear canal. While empirical recordings show tonotopic vibrations in the katydid inner ear for frequency analysis, the biophysical mechanism leading to tonotopy remains elusive due to the small size and complexity of the hearing organ. In this study, robust numerical simulations are developed for an <i>in silico</i> investigation of this process. Simulations are based on the precise katydid inner ear geometry obtained by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography, and empirically determined inner ear fluid properties for an accurate representation of the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that the triangular structure below the hearing organ drives the tonotopy and travelling waves in the inner ear, and thus has an equivalent role to the mammalian basilar membrane. This reveals a stronger analogy between the inner ear basic mechanical networks of two organisms with ancient evolutionary differences and independent phylogenetic histories.

                <p>by Victor Geadah, Stefan Horoi, Giancarlo Kerg, Guy Wolf, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, either by learning an individual static function or via a learned and shared adaptation mechanism to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such adaptive networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. Finally, we outline similarities between these optimized solutions and known coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration.

                <p>by Jorin Overwiening, Federico Tesler, Domenico Guarino, Alain Destexhe</p>

The thalamus is the brain’s central relay station, orchestrating sensory processing and cognitive functions. However, how thalamic function depends on internal and external states, is not well understood. A comprehensive understanding would necessitate the integration of single cell dynamics with their collective behavior at population level. For this we propose a biologically realistic mean-field model of the thalamus, describing thalamocortical relay neurons (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons (RE). We perform a multi-scale study of thalamic responsiveness and its dependence on cell and brain states. Building upon existing single-cell experiments we show that: (1) Awake and sleep-like states can be defined via the absence/presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which controls bursting in TC and RE. (2) Thalamic response to sensory stimuli is linear in awake state and becomes nonlinear in sleep state, while cortical input generates nonlinear response in both awake and sleep state. (3) Stimulus response is controlled by cortical input, which suppresses responsiveness in awake state while it ‘wakes-up’ the thalamus in sleep state promoting a linear response. (4) Synaptic noise induces a global linear responsiveness, diminishing the difference in response between thalamic states. Finally, the model replicates spindle oscillations within a sleep-like state, exhibiting a qualitative change in activity and responsiveness. The development of this thalamic mean-field model provides a new tool for incorporating detailed thalamic dynamics in large scale brain simulations.

                <p>by Tina Lenče, Johannes Sulzer, Kilian Andress, Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer, Vanessa Lamm-Schmidt, Lars Barquist, Redmond P. Smyth, Franziska Faber</p>

Bacterial noncoding RNAs fulfill a variety of cellular functions as catalysts, as scaffolds in protein complexes or as regulators of gene expression. They often exhibit complex tertiary structures that are a key determinant of their biochemical function. Here, we characterize the structured “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA from <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, which is conserved in more than 2,500 bacterial species from the phyla Bacillota and Actinomycetota. We show that its transcript abundance and stability in exponentially growing bacteria rivals that of ribosomal RNAs. Deletion of the “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA is associated with delayed transition into stationary phase, and changes in stationary phase pathways such as spore formation, hence we rename it ModT (modulator of transition phase). Mechanistically, we show that ModT-mediated changes in cellular cyclic di-GMP levels are linked to the pronounced sporulation defect in the <i>modT</i> mutant. Importantly, we show that expression profiles and isoform patterns of ModT are conserved in <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> and <i>Paeniclostridium sordellii</i>, and that these orthologs can functionally complement ModT in <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>. Chemical structure probing of ModT in vivo reveals dynamic refolding and provides initial evidence for a potential association of ModT with proteins. In summary, our findings indicate that ModT fulfills a conserved role in regulating growth transitions in bacteria and provide a crucial step towards delineating its molecular mechanism.

They can be degraded by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, through emulsification (rhl genes) and biodegradation processes. The BTEX tolerance genes (mlaABCD) may be present in it. The aim of this research was to evaluate, through comparative genomics, the genes of the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon polluted environments. Methods This study examines six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Each strain shows capabilities like hydrocarbon degradation and heavy metal tolerance. After DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics to assess genetic similarity. A phylogenetic tree, built from core gene alignment, reveals evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results Results showed that all strains had a double copy of the rhlB gene, arranged in the same organization, with rhlABRI genes always adjacent in a 3′-5′ direction. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation among strains, often near rhlC. The C1BHIC5 strain had only one copy of the rhlB gene, and the 3′ – 5 orientation of the rhlG gene was the exception. Most strains had two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes for toluene tolerance, with diverse orientations across strains. High synteny was noted within mla gene blocks. Compared to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D), strains of P. aeruginosa strains display a similar yet distinct gene arrangement. Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes in all the strains analyzed and the BTEX tolerance genes allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background In broiler farming, vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) is essential. Nonetheless, during the post-vaccination phase, production may be negatively impacted by mycotoxin contamination in feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toxin binders on antibody titer and large intestine histopathology after ND vaccination in broiler with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) toxication. Methods A total of 20 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 5 replications i.e. (C-) broiler groups with basal feed, (C+) broiler groups with AFB1 and OTA feed contamination, (T1) and (T2) broiler groups with exposed AFB1, OTA, and toxin binders as feed additives with dose 1.1 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg feed, respectively. ND vaccination was carried out on day 7 and 21. Antibody titers were evaluated from serum samples of broiler on days 14, 28, and 35 for further hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Histopathology of the cecum and colon organs was evaluated using HE staining on day 36. HI test and histological scoring were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s test with a p < 0.05 in SPSS v.26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results As a result, histopathological improvement of the cecum and colon was reported based on mucosal rupture, hemorrhage and necrosis on day 35. An increase in the mean antibody titer compared to days 14 and 28 was observed on day 35, with significant changes observed in serum samples based on the C+ group, which was significantly different from the C- and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study revealed that toxin binder dose of 1.6 g/kg can increase antibody titer and histopathology of cecum and colon in broiler chickens after ND vaccination fed with mycotoxin-contaminated feed.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Swelling, stiffness, and pain in synovial joints are primary hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperactivity of nociceptors and excessive release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators play a crucial role, with emerging data suggesting extensive remodelling and plasticity of joint innervations. Herein, we review structural, functional, and molecular alterations in sensory and autonomic axons wiring arthritic joints and revisit mechanisms implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors, leading to chronic pain. Sprouting and reorganization of sensory and autonomic fibers with the invasion of ectopic branches into surrounding inflamed tissues are associated with the upregulation of pain markers. These changes are frequently complemented by a phenotypic switch of sensory and autonomic profiles and activation of silent axons, inferring homeostatic adjustments and reprogramming of innervations. Identifying critical molecular players and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the rewiring and sensitization of joints is likely to elucidate causatives of neuroinflammation and chronic pain, assisting in finding new therapeutic targets and opportunities for interventions.

                Fu et al. showed that point mutations in MmTMC1/2 are localized in plasma membrane, and knockdown of UROD, RGP1, or ARL1 promotes plasma membrane localization of HsTMC1/2 in heterologous cells. HsTMC1/2 are activated by mechanical stimuli and function as pore-forming ion channels, supporting their roles as mechanotransduction channels in hair cells.

                Early host defense eliminates many viruses before infections are established while clearing others so they remain subclinical or cause only mild disease. Paludan et al. put forward a criteria-based working hypothesis proposing “microbe- and inflammation-restricting mechanisms” as central mediators of the early cellular host defense against virus infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93764">Cell-autonomous timing drives the vertebrate segmentation clock’s wave pattern</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the growing vertebrate body relies on the segmentation clock, a multi-cellular oscillating genetic network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here, we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding similarity in the relative slowing of oscillations and arrest in concert with differentiation. This shows that cell-extrinsic signals are not required by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. We show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98081">A human forebrain organoid model reveals the essential function of GTF2IRD1-TTR-ERK axis for the neurodevelopmental deficits of Williams syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams syndrome (WS; OMIM#194050) is a rare disorder, which is caused by the microdeletion of one copy of 25–27 genes, and WS patients display diverse neuronal deficits. Although remarkable progresses have been achieved, the mechanisms for these distinct deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we have shown that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in WS forebrain organoids display abnormal proliferation and differentiation capabilities, and synapse formation. Genes with altered expression are related to neuronal development and neurogenesis. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis revealed 13 clusters in healthy control and WS organoids. WS organoids show an aberrant generation of excitatory neurons. Mechanistically, the expression of transthyretin (TTR) are remarkably decreased in WS forebrain organoids. We have found that GTF2IRD1 encoded by one WS associated gene <i>GTF2IRD1</i> binds to <i>TTR</i> promoter regions and regulates the expression of <i>TTR</i>. In addition, exogenous TTR can activate ERK signaling and rescue neurogenic deficits of WS forebrain organoids. <i>Gtf2ird1</i>-deficient mice display similar neurodevelopmental deficits as observed in WS organoids. Collectively, our study reveals critical function of GTF2IRD1 in regulating neurodevelopment of WS forebrain organoids and mice through regulating TTR-ERK pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98584">Caspar specifies primordial germ cell count and identity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Repurposing of pleiotropic factors during execution of diverse cellular processes has emerged as a regulatory paradigm. Embryonic development in metazoans is controlled by maternal factors deposited in the egg during oogenesis. Here, we explore maternal role(s) of Caspar (Casp), the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) originally implicated in host-defense as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Maternal loss of either Casp or it’s protein partner, transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) leads to partial embryonic lethality correlated with aberrant centrosome behavior, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and defective gastrulation. Although ubiquitously distributed, both proteins are enriched in the primordial germ cells (PGCs), and in keeping with the centrosome problems, mutant embryos display a significant reduction in the PGC count. Moreover, the total number of pole buds is directly proportional to the level of Casp. Consistently, it’s ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ results in respective reduction and increase in the Oskar protein levels, the master determinant of PGC fate. To elucidate this regulatory loop, we analyzed several known components of mid-blastula transition and identify the translational repressor Smaug, a zygotic regulator of germ cell specification, as a potential critical target. We present a detailed structure-function analysis of Casp aimed at understanding its novel involvement during PGC development.

                Cell migration towards stiff substrates has been coined as durotaxis and implicated in development, wound healing, and cancer, where complex interplays between immune and non-immune cells are present. Compared to the emerging mechanisms underlying the strongly adhesive mesenchymal durotaxis, little is known about whether immune cells - migrating in amoeboid mode - could follow mechanical cues. Here, we develop an imaging-based confined migration device with a stiffness gradient. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality of T cells and neutrophils, we observe that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further delineate the underlying mechanism to involve non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient. Using the protista <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid durotaxis. Finally, these experimental phenomena are theoretically captured by an active gel model capable of mechanosensing. Collectively, these results may shed new lights on immune surveillance and recently identified confined migration of cancer cells, within the mechanically inhomogeneous tumor microenvironment or the inflamed fibrotic tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96691">Estradiol elicits distinct firing patterns in arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons of females through altering ion channel conductances</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are vital for pubertal development and reproduction. Arcuate nucleus Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are responsible for the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In females, the behavior of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, expressing Kiss1, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin (Dyn), varies throughout the ovarian cycle. Studies indicate that 17β-estradiol (E2) reduces peptide expression but increases <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) mRNA and glutamate neurotransmission in these neurons, suggesting a shift from peptidergic to glutamatergic signaling. To investigate this shift, we combined transcriptomics, electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling. Our results demonstrate that E2 treatment upregulates the mRNA expression of voltage-activated calcium channels, elevating the whole-cell calcium current that contributes to high-frequency burst firing. Additionally, E2 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of canonical transient receptor potential (TPRC) 5 and G protein-coupled K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels. When <i>Trpc5</i> channels in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons were deleted using CRISPR/SaCas9, the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential was eliminated. Our data enabled us to formulate a biophysically realistic mathematical model of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, suggesting that E2 modifies ionic conductances in these neurons, enabling the transition from high-frequency synchronous firing through NKB-driven activation of TRPC5 channels to a short bursting mode facilitating glutamate release. In a low E2 milieu, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons drives pulsatile release of GnRH, while the transition to burst firing with high, preovulatory levels of E2 would facilitate the GnRH surge through its glutamatergic synaptic connection to preoptic Kiss1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86978">Key epigenetic and signaling factors in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation. In contrast, adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes involved in BBB formation and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevent Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93168">Ciliary length regulation by intraflagellar transport in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                How cells regulate the size of their organelles remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Cilia, with their simple structure and surface localization, provide an ideal model for investigating organelle size control. However, most studies on cilia length regulation are primarily performed on several single-celled organisms. In contrast, the mechanism of length regulation in cilia across diverse cell types within multicellular organisms remains a mystery. Similar to humans, zebrafish contain diverse types of cilia with variable lengths. Taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish embryos, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into intraflagellar transport (IFT), an essential process for ciliogenesis. By generating a transgenic line carrying Ift88-GFP transgene, we observed IFT in multiple types of cilia with varying lengths. Remarkably, cilia exhibited variable IFT speeds in different cell types, with longer cilia exhibiting faster IFT speeds. This increased IFT speed in longer cilia is likely not due to changes in common factors that regulate IFT, such as motor selection, BBSome proteins, or tubulin modification. Interestingly, longer cilia in the ear cristae tend to form larger IFT compared to shorter spinal cord cilia. Reducing the size of IFT particles by knocking down Ift88 slowed IFT speed and resulted in the formation of shorter cilia. Our study proposes an intriguing model of cilia length regulation via controlling IFT speed through the modulation of the size of the IFT complex. This discovery may provide further insights into our understanding of how organelle size is regulated in higher vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101269">Human birth tissue products as a non-opioid medicine to inhibit post-surgical pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93518">Fluid mechanics of luminal transport in actively contracting endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest cellular compartment, harbours the machinery for the biogenesis of secretory proteins and lipids, calcium storage/mobilisation, and detoxification. It is shaped as layered membranous sheets interconnected with a network of tubules extending throughout the cell. Understanding the influence of the ER morphology dynamics on molecular transport may offer clues to rationalising neuro-pathologies caused by ER morphogen mutations. It remains unclear, however, how the ER facilitates its intra-luminal mobility and homogenises its content. It has been recently proposed that intra-luminal transport may be enabled by active contractions of ER tubules. To surmount the barriers to empirical studies of the minuscule spatial and temporal scales relevant to ER nanofluidics, here we exploit the principles of viscous fluid dynamics to generate a theoretical physical model emulating in silico the content motion in actively contracting nanoscopic tubular networks. The computational model reveals the luminal particle speeds, and their impact in facilitating active transport, of the active contractile behaviour of the different ER components along various time–space parameters. The results of the model indicate that reproducing transport with velocities similar to those reported experimentally in single-particle tracking would require unrealistically high values of tubule contraction site length and rate. Considering further nanofluidic scenarios, we show that width contractions of the ER’s flat domains (perinuclear sheets) generate local flows with only a short-range effect on luminal transport. Only contractions of peripheral sheets can reproduce experimental measurements, provided they are able to contract fast enough.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90419">Genetic inactivation of zinc transporter SLC39A5 improves liver function and hyperglycemia in obesogenic settings</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have revealed a role for zinc in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Randomized placebo-controlled zinc supplementation trials have demonstrated improved glycemic traits in patients with type II diabetes (T2D). Moreover, rare loss-of-function variants in the zinc efflux transporter <i>SLC30A8</i> reduce T2D risk. Despite this accumulated evidence, a mechanistic understanding of how zinc influences systemic glucose homeostasis and consequently T2D risk remains unclear. To further explore the relationship between zinc and metabolic traits, we searched the exome database of the Regeneron Genetics Center-Geisinger Health System DiscovEHR cohort for genes that regulate zinc levels and associate with changes in metabolic traits. We then explored our main finding using in vitro and in vivo models. We identified rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants (MAF &lt;1%) in <i>Solute Carrier Family 39, Member 5</i> (<i>SLC39A5</i>) associated with increased circulating zinc (p=4.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Trans-ancestry meta-analysis across four studies exhibited a nominal association of <i>SLC39A5</i> LOF variants with decreased T2D risk. To explore the mechanisms underlying these associations, we generated mice lacking <i>Slc39a5. Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display improved liver function and reduced hyperglycemia when challenged with congenital or diet-induced obesity. These improvements result from elevated hepatic zinc levels and concomitant activation of hepatic AMPK and AKT signaling, in part due to zinc-mediated inhibition of hepatic protein phosphatase activity. Furthermore, under conditions of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), <i>Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display significantly attenuated fibrosis and inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest SLC39A5 as a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to metabolic derangements including T2D.

                Specialized chemosensory signals elicit innate social behaviors in individuals of several vertebrate species, a process that is mediated via the accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns, and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Our analysis reveals diverse cell types with gene expression patterns specific to each, which we made available as a searchable web resource accessed from <a href="https://www.scvnoexplorer.com">https://www.scvnoexplorer.com</a>. Pseudo-time developmental analysis indicates that neurons originating from common progenitors diverge in their gene expression during maturation with transient and persistent transcription factor expression at critical branch points. Comparative analysis across two of the major neuronal subtypes that express divergent GPCR families and the G-protein subunits Gnai2 or Gnao1, reveals significantly higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes within Gnao1 neurons. In addition<b>,</b> differences in ER content and prevalence of cubic membrane ER ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy, indicate fundamental differences in ER function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90296">Projection neurons are necessary for the maintenance of the mouse olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                The assembly and maintenance of neural circuits is crucial for proper brain function. Although the assembly of brain circuits has been extensively studied, much less is understood about the mechanisms controlling their maintenance as animals mature. In the olfactory system, the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odor receptor converge into discrete synaptic structures of the olfactory bulb (OB) called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic odor map. The OB projection neurons, called mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts), have a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus, where they make synapses with OSNs. We used a genetic method to progressively eliminate the vast majority of M/T cells in early postnatal mice, and observed that the assembly of the OB bulb circuits proceeded normally. However, as the animals became adults the apical dendrite of remaining M/Ts grew multiple branches that innervated several glomeruli, and OSNs expressing single odor receptors projected their axons into multiple glomeruli, disrupting the olfactory sensory map. Moreover, ablating the M/Ts in adult animals also resulted in similar structural changes in the projections of remaining M/Ts and axons from OSNs. Interestingly, the ability of these mice to detect odors was relatively preserved despite only having 1–5% of projection neurons transmitting odorant information to the brain, and having highly disrupted circuits in the OB. These results indicate that a reduced number of projection neurons does not affect the normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but induces structural instability of the olfactory circuitry of adult animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98016">CCDC113 stabilizes sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus to ensure male fertility</a></h4>

              
                The structural integrity of the sperm is crucial for male fertility, defects in sperm head-tail linkage and flagellar axoneme are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS) and the multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Notably, impaired head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) often accompanies defects in the flagellum structure, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and HTCA, which caused male infertility. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 could bind to CFAP57 and CFAP91, and function as an adaptor protein for the connection of radial spokes, nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. Moreover, CCDC113 was identified as a structural component of HTCA, collaborating with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to connect sperm head to tail during spermiogenesis. Together, our studies reveal that CCDC113 serve as a critical hub for sperm axoneme and HTCA stabilization in mice, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of infertility associated with human <i>CCDC113</i> mutations.

">Data-driven synapse classification reveals a logic of glutamate receptor composition</a></h4>

              
                The rich diversity of synapses facilitates the capacity of neural circuits to transmit, process and store information. Here, we used multiplex super-resolution proteometric imaging through array tomography to define features of single synapses in the adult mouse neocortex. We find that glutamatergic synapses cluster into subclasses that parallel the distinct biochemical and functional categories of receptor subunits: GluA1/4, GluA2/3 and GluN1/GluN2B. Two of these subclasses align with physiological expectations based on synaptic plasticity: large AMPAR-rich synapses may represent potentiated synapses, whereas small NMDAR-rich synapses suggest "silent" synapses. The NMDA receptor content of large synapses correlates with spine neck diameter, and thus the potential for coupling to the parent dendrite. Conjugate array tomography's rigorous registration of immunofluorescence with electron microscopy provides validation for future super-resolution imaging studies in other systems. No barriers prevent generalization of this approach to other species, laying a foundation for future studies of human disorders and therapeutics.

">Investigating cerebellar control in slow gait adaptations: Insights from predictive simulations of split-belt walking</a></h4>

              
                During split-belt treadmill walking, neurotypical humans exhibit slow adaptations, characterized by a gradual decrease in step length asymmetry, whereas individuals with cerebellar damage do not show these motor adaptations. We used a neuromusculoskeletal model to better understand individual aspects of the underlying neural control. Specifically, we extended a spinal reflex model by adding a supraspinal layer, representing the cerebellum and its main function of error-driven motor adaptation. The cerebellum, based on the mismatch between an internal prediction and the actual motor outcome, can modulate spinal motor commands within the simulation. Using this model, we investigated the effect of an isolated adaptation of gait timing parameters, in our case the beginning of the liftoff phase. We created 80 s predictive simulations of the model walking on a split-belt treadmill with a 2:1 belt-speed ratio, and evaluated the results by comparing spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics with literature. The simulations exhibited adaptation patterns similar to those observed in human experiments. Specifically, the step length symmetry decreased from an initial asymmetric level toward the baseline, driven primarily by adaptations in the fast step length, while the individual joint kinematics remained similar. The adaptations affected the spatial and temporal domains, represented by a change in the center of oscillation difference and limb phasing. Our findings suggest that reflex gains do not necessarily need to be adapted to achieve changes in step length asymmetry and that, unlike what had been inferred from experiments, the same neural mechanism might account for adaptations in the spatial and temporal domains at different rates. Our simulations demonstrated distinct adaptation patterns corresponding to slow and fast learning behaviors, as reported in the literature, through modifications of a single cerebellar parameter, the adaptation rate. The framework can be extended to test different hypotheses about motor control and adaptations during continuous perturbation tasks.

">Network-based amyloid-beta pathology predicts subsequent cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults</a></h4>

              
                The deposition of amyloid-beta protein in the human brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and is related to cognitive decline. However, the relationship between early amyloid-beta deposition and future cognitive impairment remains poorly understood, particularly concerning its spatial distribution and network-level effects. Here, we employed a cross-validated machine learning approach and investigated whether integrating subject-specific brain connectome information with amyloid-beta burden measures improves predictive validity for subsequent cognitive decline. Baseline regional amyloid-beta pathology measures from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging predicted prospective cognitive decline. Incorporating structural connectome, but not functional connectome, information into the amyloid-beta measures improved predictive performance. We further identified a neuropathological signature pattern linked to future cognitive decline, which was validated in an independent cohort. These findings advance our understanding of how amyloid-beta pathology relates to brain networks and highlight the potential of network-based metrics for amyloid-beta-PET imaging to identify individuals at higher risk of cognitive decline.

	<p>The current standard of care for brain tumor management includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent advances in image-guided surgical techniques have enhanced the precision of tumor resections, yet there remains a critical need for innovative technologies to further improve patient outcomes. Techniques such as fluorescence image-guided neurosurgery in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery have improved outcomes for patients with brain tumors. In this article for Brain Science&amp;amp;rsquo;s Special Issue Recent Advances in Translational Neuro-Oncology, we review the use of image-guided neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain tumors. In addition, we summarize the emerging use of theranostic nanoparticles for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies to enable the neurosurgeon to perform more precise surgical resections in the operating room, to specifically target the delivery of existing and novel treatments to tumor cells, and to augment the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery. These innovative translational tools will allow neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, and radiation oncologists to go &amp;amp;ldquo;beyond the knife&amp;amp;rdquo; to improve the survival of brain tumor patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A multimodal brain age estimation model could provide enhanced insights into brain aging. However, effectively integrating multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance the accuracy of brain age estimation remains a challenging task. Methods: In this study, we developed an innovative data fusion technique employing a low-rank tensor fusion algorithm, tailored specifically for deep learning-based frameworks aimed at brain age estimation. Specifically, we utilized structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to extract spatial&amp;amp;ndash;temporal brain features with different properties. These features were fused using the low-rank tensor algorithm and employed as predictors for estimating brain age. Results: Our prediction model achieved a desirable prediction accuracy on the independent test samples, demonstrating its robust performance. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the low-rank tensor fusion algorithm has the potential to effectively integrate multimodal data into deep learning frameworks for estimating brain age.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease of both upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs) leading invariably to decline in motor function. The clinical exam is foundational to the diagnosis of the disease, and ordinal severity scales are used to track its progression. However, the lack of objective biomarkers of disease classification and progression delay clinical trial enrollment, muddle inclusion criteria, and limit accurate assessment of drug efficacy. Ultimately, biomarker evidence of therapeutic target engagement will support, and perhaps supplant, more traditional clinical trial outcome measures. Electrophysiology tools including nerve conduction study and electromyography (EMG) have already been established as diagnostic biomarkers of LMN degeneration in ALS. Additional understanding of the motor manifestations of disease is provided by motor unit number estimation, electrical impedance myography, and single-fiber EMG techniques. Dysfunction of UMN and non-motor brain areas is being increasingly assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation, high-density electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography; less common autonomic and sensory nervous system dysfunction in ALS can also be characterized. Although most of these techniques are used to explore the underlying disease mechanisms of ALS in research settings, they have the potential on a broader scale to noninvasively identify disease subtypes, predict progression rates, and assess physiologic engagement of experimental therapies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: To examine the relationships between state affect and sleep health at within- and between-person levels among health science students. Methods: A correlational design was used and 54 health science students were included. The participants completed baseline and 7-day ambulatory assessments in a free-living setting. Daily sleep and affect were measured using the Consensus Sleep Diary and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the effects of affect on sleep health. Results: The participants were 19.8 (SD, 0.6) years and 92.6% were females. Approximately 40% had poor sleep quality. Controlling for the potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, and bedtime procrastination), higher within-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, and less feeling rested. Higher between-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration. Higher within-person positive affect predicted longer sleep onset latency. Higher within- and between-person positive affect predicted more feeling rested. Conclusions: Negative affect was most consistently associated with sleep health at the individual level. Affect regulation should be considered when delivering personalized interventions targeting sleep health among health science students.</p>

                <p>Although most adults in the United States will drink alcohol in their life, only ~6% will go on to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). While a great deal of work has furthered our understanding of the cycle of addiction, it remains unclear why certain people transition to disordered drinking. Altered activity in regions implicated in AUDs, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA), has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of AUDs, but how these networks contribute to alcohol misuse remains unclear. Here we investigated how the impact of alcohol on the BLA network relates to alcohol exposure. We first examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on the BLA and frontal cortical networks and the relationship with subsequent voluntary ethanol consumption using the Intermittent Access paradigm. In addition, we recorded network activity from the BLA and frontal cortex throughout the Drinking-in-the-Dark-Multiple Scheduled Access paradigm to assess the impact of voluntary alcohol consumption on network states during binge and abstinence periods. Finally, we investigated the impact of acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure on BLA and frontal cortex network states using the Chronic Intermittent Ethanol (vapor) paradigm. We demonstrate that across paradigms, ethanol alters low gamma band (40&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and remarkably correlates with the extent of future voluntary ethanol consumption in the IA paradigm. These data suggest that BLA network states play a role in the mechanisms influencing voluntary alcohol intake.</p>

                <p>Maintaining concentration on demanding cognitive tasks, such as vigilance (VG) and working memory (WM) tasks, is crucial for successful task completion. Previous research suggests that internal concentration maintenance fluctuates, potentially declining to suboptimal states, which can influence trial-by-trial performance in these tasks. However, the timescale of such alertness maintenance, as indicated by slow changes in pupil diameter, has not been thoroughly investigated. This study explored whether "pupil trends"&mdash;which selectively signal suboptimal tonic alertness maintenance at various timescales&mdash;negatively correlate with trial-by-trial performance in VG and WM tasks. Using the psychomotor vigilance task (VG) and the visual&ndash;spatial two-back task (WM), we found that human pupil trends lasting over 10&nbsp;s were significantly higher in trials with longer reaction times, indicating poorer performance, compared with shorter reaction time trials, which indicated better performance. The attention network test further validated that these slow trends reflect suboptimal states related to (tonic) alertness maintenance rather than suboptimal performance specific to VG and WM tasks, which is more associated with (phasic) responses to instantaneous interference. These findings highlight the potential role of detecting and compensating for nonoptimal states in VG and WM performance, significantly beyond the 10&nbsp;s timescale. Additionally, the findings suggest the possibility of estimating human concentration during various visual tasks, even when rapid pupil changes occur due to luminance fluctuations.</p>

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient. Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral patellar tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 10 and 5 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                <p>by Yutong Sun, Peng Qiu</p>

When analyzing scRNA-seq data containing heterogeneous cell populations, an important task is to select informative marker genes to distinguish various cell clusters and annotate the clusters with biologically meaningful cell types. In existing analysis methods and pipelines, marker genes are typically identified using a one-vs-all strategy, examining differential expression between one cell cluster versus the combination of all other cell clusters. However, this strategy applied to cell clusters belonging to closely related cell types often generates overlapping marker genes, which capture the common signature of closely related cell clusters but provide limited information for distinguishing them. To address the limitations of the one-vs-all strategy, we propose a hierarchical marker gene selection strategy that groups similar cell clusters and selects marker genes in a hierarchical manner. This strategy is able to improve the accuracy and interpretability of cell type identification in single-cell RNA-seq data.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene (isoform 2, 3, or 4). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology.

                <p>by Atle E. Rimehaug, Anders M. Dale, Anton Arkhipov, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of the extracellular potential, reflects transmembrane currents in the vicinity of the recording electrode. Thought mainly to stem from currents caused by synaptic input, it provides information about neural activity complementary to that of spikes, the output of neurons. However, the many neural sources contributing to the LFP, and likewise the derived current source density (CSD), can often make it challenging to interpret. Efforts to improve its interpretability have included the application of statistical decomposition tools like principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to disentangle the contributions from different neural sources. However, their underlying assumptions of, respectively, orthogonality and statistical independence are not always valid for the various processes or pathways generating LFP. Here, we expand upon and validate a decomposition algorithm named Laminar Population Analysis (LPA), which is based on physiological rather than statistical assumptions. LPA utilizes the multiunit activity (MUA) and LFP jointly to uncover the contributions of different populations to the LFP. To perform the validation of LPA, we used data simulated with the large-scale, biophysically detailed model of mouse V1 developed by the Allen Institute. We find that LPA can identify laminar positions within V1 and the temporal profiles of laminar population firing rates from the MUA. We also find that LPA can estimate the salient current sinks and sources generated by feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), recurrent activity in V1, and feedback input from the lateromedial (LM) area of visual cortex. LPA identifies and distinguishes these contributions with a greater accuracy than the alternative statistical decomposition methods, PCA and ICA. The contributions from different cortical layers within V1 could however not be robustly separated and identified with LPA. This is likely due to substantial synchrony in population firing rates across layers, which may be reduced with other stimulus protocols in the future. Lastly, we also demonstrate the application of LPA on experimentally recorded MUA and LFP from 24 animals in the publicly available Visual Coding dataset. Our results suggest that LPA can be used both as a method to estimate positions of laminar populations and to uncover salient features in LFP/CSD contributions from different populations.

The interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration, and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. However, current high-throughput approaches mainly focus on cells grown on plastic in 2D, making it difficult to apply these to the study of ECM dynamics. Here, we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake, based on the of use automated ECM coating for the generation of highly homogeneous ECM a pH-sensitive dye to image ECM trafficking in live cells. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38β), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound α2β1 integrin. Mechanistically, we show that down-regulation of the sodium/proton exchanger 1 (NHE1), an established macropinocytosis regulator and a target of p38, mediated ECM macropinocytosis. Moreover, disruption of α2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and NHE1-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Of note, integrin-bound ECM was targeted for lysosomal degradation, which was required for cell migration on cell-derived matrices. Finally, α2β1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly up-regulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and α2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the α2β1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression, demonstrating that our high-content screening approach has the capability of identifying novel regulators of cancer cell invasion.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mandate for this special issue of Hippocampus was to provide a few examples of one's own work in a relatively personal context. Accordingly, I will discuss some of my own work here, but will also provide a broader arc of ideas and discoveries within which the efforts of myself and many others have taken place. This history begins with the associationists, who proposed that the human mind could be understood, in part, as a compounding of simple associations between contiguously occurring items and events. This idea was taken up by the behaviorist traditions, which made significant progress toward refining this simple idea. Subsequently, as interest turned toward neural mechanisms, Donald Hebb provided a foundational proposal for how synaptic changes could provide for this associative learning. The associationist view was, however, challenged by gestaltists who took a more wholistic, cognitive approach. Stunning support was provided for Tolman's cognitive map idea with the discovery of place cells in the hippocampus, and the subsequent treatise provided in O'Keefe and Nadel's <i>The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map</i>. I propose that, ultimately, this associationist versus cognitive debate was settled by the development of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach, which incorporated Hebbian synapses into large, neural-like networks, which could accomplish complex cognitive tasks. My own work took place within the framework provided by O'Keefe and Nadel. One aspect of my work followed Jim Ranck's discovery of Head Direction cells. Tad Blair and others in my lab traced a brainstem circuit, which we proposed could explain the origins of the directional code. In other work, I investigated cells in the subicular region. These provided a contrast to the hippocampal place cells in that each subicular cell kept the same spatial pattern across different environments, whereas the hippocampal cells formed a different map for each context.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamatergic dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) innervate the primary DG cell type, granule cells (GCs). Numerous MC synapses are on GC proximal dendrites in the inner molecular layer (IML). However, field recordings of the GC excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) have not been used to study this pathway selectively. Here we describe methods to selectively activate MC axons in the IML using mice with Cre recombinase expressed in MCs. Slices were made after injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the DG. In these slices, we show that fEPSPs could be recorded reliably in the IML in response to optogenetic stimulation of MC axons. Furthermore, fEPSPs were widespread across the septotemporal axis. However, fEPSPs were relatively weak because they were small in amplitude and did not elicit a significant population spike in GCs. They also showed little paired pulse facilitation. We confirmed the extracellular findings with patch clamp recordings of GCs despite different recording chambers and other differences in methods. Together the results provide a simple method for studying MC activation of GCs and add to the evidence that this input is normally weak but widespread across the GC population.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (<i>r</i> = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>When I began my career, I had no idea that much of it would center around the hippocampus. Here I discuss some of the history of how this happened. I briefly mention my early undergraduate life and the problems it posed for getting into graduate school. I describe the unique circumstances that led me to Allan Wagner's laboratory and changed my career trajectory. My path to the hippocampus began with a decision to study memory development. This led to a collaboration with Rob Sutherland that produced the configural theory of the hippocampus. The idea was that the hippocampus facilitated the construction of representations of the co-occurring stimulus elements currently experienced by the organism. Thus, if two elements, A and B, occurred together, a representation, AB, could be constructed that could be discriminated from its elements, A and B. This idea was partially correct, but we missed an important property of the hippocampal system that was recognized by O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 that is, that the hippocampus is an unmotivated, rapid learning system. Randy O'Reilly and I addressed this issue in what we called conjunctive representation theory and put forth a detailed cortical-hippocampus computational theory to explain how this could work I later realized that our ideas were remarkably like Tim Teyler's indexing theory of how the hippocampal system supports memory. At a Park City meeting, a chance encounter with Tim (whom I had never met) resulted in the opportunity to write a paper with Tim updating the indexing theory, It is my favorite theoretical paper.</p>

                The lateral thalamus (LT) receives input from primary sensory nuclei and responds to multimodal stimuli. The LT is also involved in regulating innate and social behaviors through its projections to cortical and limbic networks. However, the importance of multisensory processing within the LT in modulating behavioral output has not been explicitly addressed. Here, we discuss recent findings primarily from rodent studies that extend the classical view of the LT as a passive relay, by underscoring its involvement in associating multimodal features and encoding the salience, valence, and social relevance of sensory signals. We propose that the primary function of the LT is to integrate sensory and non-sensory aspects of multisensory input to gate naturalistic behaviors.

                Across studied vertebrates, the medial amygdala (MeA) is a central hub for relaying sensory information with social and/or survival relevance to downstream nuclei such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and the hypothalamus. MeA-driven behaviors, such as mating, aggression, parenting, and predator avoidance are processed by different molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neuronal output populations. Work over the past two decades has deciphered how diverse MeA neurons arise from embryonic development, revealing contributions from multiple telencephalic and diencephalic progenitor domains. Here, we first provide a brief overview of current findings regarding the role of the MeA in social behaviors, followed by a deeper dive into current knowledge of how this complex structure is specified during development. We outline a conceptual model of MeA formation that has emerged based on these findings. We further postulate how embryonic developmental programming of the MeA may inform later emergence of stereotypical circuitry governing hardwired behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96338">A systematic review and meta-analysis of eyespot anti-predator mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Eyespot patterns have evolved in many prey species. These patterns were traditionally explained by the eye mimicry hypothesis, which proposes that eyespots resembling vertebrate eyes function as predator avoidance. However, it is possible that eyespots do not mimic eyes: according to the conspicuousness hypothesis, eyespots are just one form of vivid signals where only conspicuousness matters. They might work simply through neophobia or unfamiliarity, without necessarily implying aposematism or the unprofitability to potential predators. To test these hypotheses and explore factors influencing predators’ responses, we conducted a meta-analysis with 33 empirical papers that focused on bird responses to both real lepidopterans and artificial targets with conspicuous patterns (i.e. eyespots and non-eyespots). Supporting the latter hypothesis, the results showed no clear difference in predator avoidance efficacy between eyespots and non-eyespots. When comparing geometric pattern characteristics, bigger pattern sizes and smaller numbers of patterns were more effective in preventing avian predation. This finding indicates that single concentric patterns have stronger deterring effects than paired ones. Taken together, our study supports the conspicuousness hypothesis more than the eye mimicry hypothesis. Due to the number and species coverage of published studies so far, the generalisability of our conclusion may be limited. The findings highlight that pattern conspicuousness is key to eliciting avian avoidance responses, shedding a different light on this classic example of signal evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97552">The evolutionary history of the ancient weevil family Belidae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) reveals the marks of Gondwana breakup and major floristic turnovers, including the rise of angiosperms</a></h4>

              
                The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera <i>Rhinotia</i> (Australian region) and <i>Proterhinus</i> (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.

                Marcks and Marcksl1 are abundant proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and membrane to modulate multiple cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and secretion. Here, we performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> to reveal the novel roles of these proteins in spinal cord development and regeneration. We show that Marcks and Marcksl1 have partly redundant functions and are required for normal neurite formation and proliferation of neuro-glial progenitors during embryonic spinal cord development and for its regeneration during tadpole stages. Rescue experiments in Marcks and Marcksl1 loss-of-function animals further suggested that some of the functions of Marcks and Marcksl1 in the spinal cord are mediated by phospholipid signaling. Taken together, these findings identify Marcks and Marcksl1 as critical new players in spinal cord development and regeneration and suggest new pathways to be targeted for therapeutic stimulation of spinal cord regeneration in human patients.

                Retinal degeneration in mammals causes permanent loss of vision, due to an inability to regenerate naturally. Some non-mammalian vertebrates show robust regeneration, via Muller glia (MG). We have recently made significant progress in stimulating adult mouse MG to regenerate functional neurons by transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1. While these results showed that MG can serve as an endogenous source of neuronal replacement, the efficacy of this process is limited. With the goal of improving this in mammals, we designed a small molecule screen using sci-Plex, a method to multiplex up to thousands of single-nucleus RNA-seq conditions into a single experiment. We used this technology to screen a library of 92 compounds, identified, and validated two that promote neurogenesis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling can substantially improve the discovery process for molecules and pathways that can stimulate neural regeneration and further demonstrate the potential for this approach to restore vision in patients with retinal disease.

The resulting framework, when combined with an efficient method for factorizing high-dimensional vectors, can represent and operate on numerical values over a large dynamic range using resources that scale only logarithmically with the range, a vast improvement over previous methods. It also exhibits impressive robustness to noise.

However, there is an increased risk of erroneously detecting random noise fluctuations as CPs. The primary goal of this study is to rigorously control the risk of false detections by providing theoretically valid p-values to the CPs detected by RNN. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method based on the framework of selective inference (SI). SI enables valid inferences by conditioning on the event of hypothesis selection, thus mitigating bias from generating and testing hypotheses on the same data. In this study, we apply an SI framework to RNN-based CP detection, where characterizing the complex process of RNN selecting CPs is our main technical challenge.

Here, we consider a decision-theoretic approach to study networks of bounded rational decision makers that are allowed to specialize and communicate with each other. In contrast to previous work that has focused on feedforward communication between decision-making agents, we consider cyclical information processing paths allowing for back-and-forth communication. We adapt message-passing algorithms to suit this purpose, essentially allowing for local information flow between units and thus enabling circular dependency structures. We provide examples that show how repeated communication can increase performance given that each unit’s information processing capability is limited and that decision-making systems with too few or too many connections and feedback loops achieve suboptimal utility.</span>

Modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods perform a similar operation but in terms of scalar rewards. Despite this similarity, the relationship between action updates of deep RL and human error–based learning has yet to be investigated. Here, we systematically compare the three major families of deep RL algorithms to human error–based learning. We show that all three deep RL approaches are qualitatively different from human error–based learning, as assessed by a mirror-reversal perturbation experiment. To bridge this gap, we developed an alternative deep RL algorithm inspired by human error–based learning, model-based deterministic policy gradients (MB-DPG). We showed that MB-DPG captures human error–based learning under mirror-reversal and rotational perturbations and that MB-DPG learns faster than canonical model-free algorithms on complex arm-based reaching tasks, while being more robust to (forward) model misspecification than model-based RL.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Even as machine learning exceeds human-level performance on many applications, the generality, robustness, and rapidity of the brain’s learning capabilities remain unmatched. How cognition arises from neural activity is <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> central open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of intelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in Papadimitriou et al. (<a href="#bib37" class="reflinks">2020</a>) and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical proofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive operations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However, many intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and manipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to list a few). Here we show that in the same model, sequential precedence can be captured naturally through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a result, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out. In particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to the memorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: upon future presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assembly and its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the end of the sequence. If the stimulus sequence is presented to two brain areas simultaneously, a scaffolded representation is created, resulting in more efficient memorization and recall, in agreement with cognitive experiments. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learned in a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns of sequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be capable of universal computation. Taken together, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the brain’s remarkable abilities to compute and learn, with sequences playing a vital role.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The free energy principle (FEP) describes (biological) agents as minimizing a variational free energy (FE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., <a href="#bib18" class="reflinks">2023</a>) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message-passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.</span>

">Cell type mapping of mild malformations of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy using single-nucleus multiomics</a></h4>

              
                Objective Mild malformations of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy (MOGHE) are brain lesions associated with focal epilepsy and characterized by increased oligodendroglial density, heterotopic neurons, and hypomyelination in the white matter. While previous studies have implicated somatic mutations in the SLC35A2 gene, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying MOGHE pathogenesis remain elusive. To address this gap, this study aimed to systematically characterize the cell type composition and molecular alterations of MOGHE lesions at cellular resolution using single-nucleus multiomics profiling. Methods We performed single-nucleus multiomics sequencing to obtain paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of > 31,000 nuclei from gray matter and white matter regions of MOGHE lesions, and compared the results with publicly available neurotypical control datasets. Results The analysis of gray and white matter regions from two MOGHE patients revealed significant cellular composition alterations, including an oligodendrocyte expansion and heterotopic neurons within the subcortical white matter. We identified a distinct population of MOGHE-associated oligodendrocytes characterized by expressing genes related to immune response, myelination disruption, and epilepsy-related pathways. These oligodendrocytes shared a common transcriptional signature with oligodendrocytes in other neurological conditions involving white matter abnormalities. Further analysis of heterotopic neurons in MOGHE revealed the upregulation of genes associated with neuronal migration and the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanism underlying their atypical localization. Significance This high-resolution cell type mapping of MOGHE lesions in clinical samples unveils neuronal and glial populations affected by the disease, and provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of MOGHE.

">All ribosomal RNAs and 45S spacers from humans to worms are packed with organism-specific motifs whose other copies are found predominantly in numerous nervous system genes including many associated with human disorders</a></h4>

              
                The nucleotide sequences of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and the spacers of 45S are tuned to fulfill optimally their respective roles during ribosome biosynthesis and function. We report that these sequences satisfy additional genome-wide constraints in humans, mice, fruit flies, and worms. In all four organisms, the rRNAs and 45S spacers are densely packed with organism-specific nucleotide motifs with many additional identical copies throughout the genome. The human rRNAs and 45S spacers contain 1,723 motifs whose sequences are unique to the rRNAs/spacers of primates. These motifs have numerous additional exact intronic and exonic copies whose genomic placement is also unique to primates. Specific combinations of the motifs appear exclusively in 3,430 human nervous system and developmental genes, including 1,046 risk genes for autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. RNA/RNA crosslinking experiments show that the rRNA/spacer motifs are contact points for rRNA-mRNA and mRNA-mRNA heteroduplexes. RNA binding protein (RBP) assays show that these motifs are also in the binding sites of 113 RBPs. RNA sequencing reveals that rRNAs and spacers produce endogenous small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that carry the same primate-specific motifs. Lastly, the motifs' intergenic and intronic copies overlap 131 GWAS polymorphisms associated with neuropathologies (p-val<3.9e-12). The findings suggest that the motifs facilitate RNA/RNA and RBP/RNA interactions that are affected by polymorphisms and modulated by rRNA- and spacer-derived sncRNAs carrying the same motifs. Our study also genetically links for the first time rRNAs and 45S spacers to autism and other typically human neurological disorders. Mutation panels based on these motifs can lead to new molecular diagnostics for these disorders, whereas snRNAs carrying these motifs can serve as drugs or potential therapeutic targets.

">Cognitive effort and reward. Functional imaging of time on task and the involvement of dopaminergic and cholinergic substrates</a></h4>

              
                Numerous neuroimaging studies have identified the cortical network associated with sustained cognitive efforts and control and its modulation by rewards. Different lines of evidence implicate the prefrontal cortex (especially the anterior cingulum, ACC), dopaminergic, and cholinergic substrates in this modulation. To inquire about involvement of these substrates, we studied their activity at increasing time on task (providing increasing levels of cognitive effort) in trial blocks with differing reward levels. In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was found to be extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum, consistent with their motivational role and previous studies, but did not reflect increasing time on task. Instead, parts of the ventral forebrain corresponding to the location of cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels. This finding is consistent with a cholinergic role in driving compensatory efforts modulated by reward levels, while dopaminergic substrates track levels of expected rewards irrespective of required sustained attention efforts. These findings identify a distinct neuroimaging phenotype associated with sustaining task sets and cognitive efforts.

">Deconstruction of a memory engram reveals distinct ensembles recruited at learning</a></h4>

              
                How are associative memories formed? Which cells represent a memory, and when are they engaged? By visualizing and tagging cells based on their calcium influx with unparalleled temporal precision, we identified non-overlapping dorsal CA1 neuronal ensembles that are differentially active during associative fear memory acquisition. We dissected the acquisition experience into periods during which salient stimuli were presented or certain mouse behaviors occurred and found that cells associated with specific acquisition periods are sufficient alone to drive memory expression and contribute to fear engram formation. This study delineated the different identities of the cell ensembles active during learning, and revealed, for the first time, which ones form the core engram and are essential for memory formation and recall.

">What are you talking about? Representation of the Topic of Speech in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                A sentence outside the context provides very restricted information to the listener. Real understanding requires one to be able to place it within the sequence of sentences forming a coherent story and just as importantly, within ones general knowledge of the topic. Here, we demonstrate the existence of functional brain networks that are robustly sensitive to the topic of ca. 6-minute-long coherent newspaper articles. The main network hubs are located in the parietal and temporal brain regions. These networks changed very slowly during the course of the article, consistent with their involvement in representing the topic rather than the story aspect of the context. Because even the meaning of words can depend on the topic (see, e.g., the word shuttle in transportation and weaving), the topic-sensitive network must also be intimately linked with the mental lexicon underlying language comprehension.

">Selective Targeting of a Defined Subpopulation of Corticospinal Neurons using a Novel Klhl14-Cre Mouse Line Enables Molecular and Anatomical Investigations through Development into Maturity</a></h4>

              
                The corticospinal tract (CST) facilitates skilled, precise movements, which necessitates that subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) establish segmentally specific connectivity with brainstem and spinal circuits. Developmental molecular delineation enables prospective identification of corticospinal neurons (CSN) projecting to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments; however, it remains unclear whether other SCPN subpopulations in developing sensorimotor cortex can be prospectively identified in this manner. Such molecular tools could enable investigations of SCPN circuitry with precision and specificity. During development, Kelch-like 14 (Klhl14) is specifically expressed by a specific SCPN subpopulation, CSNBC-lat, that reside in lateral sensorimotor cortex with axonal projections exclusively to bulbar-cervical targets. In this study, we generated Klhl14-T2A-Cre knock-in mice to investigate SCPN that are Klhl14+ during development into maturity. Using conditional anterograde and retrograde labeling, we find that Klhl14-Cre is specifically expressed by CSNBC-lat only at specific developmental time points. We establish conditional viral labeling in Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice as a new approach to reliably investigate CSNBC-lat axon targeting and confirm that this identifies known molecular regulators of CSN axon targeting. Therefore, Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice can be used as a novel tool for identifying molecular regulators of CST axon guidance in a relatively high-throughput manner in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that intersectional viral labeling enables precise targeting of only Klhl14-Cre+ CSNBC-lat in the adult central nervous system. Together, our results establish that developmental molecular delineation of SCPN subpopulations can be used to selectively and specifically investigate their development, as well as anatomical and functional organization into maturity.

">Age-related decline in neural phase-locking to envelope and temporal fine structure revealed by frequency following responses: A potential signature of cochlear synaptopathy impairing speech intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                Assessing the contribution of cochlear synaptopathy (CS) to the variability in speech-in-noise intelligibility among individuals remains a challenge. While several studies have proposed biomarkers for CS based on neural phase-locking to the temporal envelope (ENV), fewer have investigated how CS affects the coding of temporal fine structure (TFS), despite its crucial role in speech-in-noise perception. In this study, we specifically examined whether TFS-based markers of CS could be derived from electrophysiological responses and psychophysical detection thresholds of spectral modulation (SM) in a complex tone, which serves as a parametric model of speech. We employed an integrated approach, combining psychophysical testing with frequency-following response (FFR) measurements in three groups of participants: young normal-hearing (yNH), older normal-hearing (oNH), and older hearing-impaired (oHI) individuals. We expanded on previous work by assessing phase-locking to both ENV, using a 4 kHz rectangular amplitude-modulated (RAM) tone, and TFS, using a low-frequency (<1.5 kHz) SM complex tone. Overall, FFR results showed significant reductions in neural phase-locking to both ENV and TFS components with age and hearing loss. Specifically, the strength of TFS-related FFRs, particularly the component corresponding to the harmonic closest to the peak of the spectral envelope (~500 Hz), was negatively correlated with age, even after adjusting for audiometric thresholds. This TFS marker also correlated with ENV-related FFRs derived from the RAM tone, suggesting a shared decline in phase-locking capacity across low and high cochlear frequencies. Computational simulations of the auditory periphery indicated that the observed FFR strength reduction with age is consistent with approximately 50% loss of auditory nerve fibers, aligning with histopathological data. However, the TFS-based FFR marker did not account for variability in speech intelligibility observed in the same participants. Psychophysical measurements showed no age-related effects and were unrelated to the TFS-based FFR marker, highlighting the need for further psychophysical research to establish a behavioral counterpart. Altogether, our results demonstrate that FFRs to vowel-like stimuli can serve as a complementary electrophysiological marker for assessing neural coding fidelity to stimulus TFS. This approach could provide a valuable tool for better understanding the impact of CS on an important coding dimension for speech-in-noise perception.

">Sneezing in response to bright light exposure: A case study in a photic sneezer</a></h4>

              
                Background: The photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is a widespread, yet understudied phenomenon characterised by sneezing in response to bright-light exposure, reportedly affecting around 30% of the general population. Our goals were to collect real-world data to characterise PSR-inducing naturalistic light conditions, and to develop an indoor protocol to reliably induce the PSR in affected subjects using parametric stimuli. Methods: This study was carried out on one male adult affected by photic sneezing (n=1). To characterise naturalistic light conditions eliciting photic sneezing, real-world light exposure was measured over a 30-day period, while logging PSR events. To study photic sneezing in response to artificial stimuli, a setup including a multi-primary LED source and an integrating sphere was used to present 30-second light stimuli to the subject while collecting pupillometric data with an eye-tracker. Results: 82 photic sneeze events were recorded, with an average of 2.73 sneezes per day and a range of 1 to 6 sneezes per event. At a sneeze event, illuminance is on average ten times bigger than five minutes before the sneeze event. A significant increase in illuminance is observed around 2 minutes before the sneeze event. Light levels go back down to pre-sneeze levels within 10 minutes after sneezing. Despite exposure to more than 150 stimuli, no sneeze could be artificially induced in the subject. However, a strong tickling sensation was consistently reported, especially for high illuminance settings. Conclusions: Real-world light data confirmed that a sudden increase in environmental lighting conditions can induce photic sneezing. Further analysis could be relevant on instances of illuminance increments not eliciting a photic sneeze. The experimental setup only elicited tickling sensations, but with further testing and optimisation, it is reasonable to assume that it would reliably induce photic sneezes, thereby opening further mechanistic study of this intriguing phenomenon.

                The genus Peromyscus has been extensively used as a model for ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary investigations. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), craniofacial morphology, and pinna measurements to compare characteristics that impact hearing in two wild-caught species, P. leucopus P. maniculatus. We observed significant statistical differences in craniofacial and pinna attributes between species with P. leucopus overall exhibiting larger features than P. maniculatus. ABR recordings indicated that both species showed similar best frequency thresholds between 8-24 kHz. We found significant effects of intensity on amplitude ratio of wave I and IV for P. maniculatus, but not P. leucopus and effects of wave number on slope of the latency-intensity function with higher wave IV and shorter wave I slope of latency intensity function in P. leucopus. Finally, the data showed significant differences in latency shift of the DN1 component of the BIC in relation to ITD between species, while no significant differences were observed across relative DN1 amplitude. This study supports the used of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus as future model species for auditory research.

">Exercise-induced differential transcriptional output of AMPK signalling improves axon regeneration and functional recovery</a></h4>

              
                In adulthood, the regenerative capacity of the injured brain circuit is poor preventing functional restoration. Rehabilitative physical exercise is a promising approach to overcome such functional impairment and the metabolic sensor AMPK has emerged to be a critical mediator for this. However, the mechanistic understanding of upstream and downstream components of AMPK signalling in the physical exercise-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration is not clear. We combined swimming exercise with laser axotomy of posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to address this question. We found that direct activation of AMPK through AICAR treatment is sufficient to improve axon regeneration and functional recovery. The PAR-4/Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) acts upstream of AMPK to enhance functional recovery following swimming exercise. Using genetics, tissue-specific RNAi, and AICAR treatment, we found that the transcriptional regulators DAF-16 and MDT-15 act downstream of AMPK in mediating the positive effects of swimming. We found that MDT-15 acts in neuron to mediate the benefit of AMPK activation in axon regeneration, whereas DAF-16 acts both in neuron and muscle to promote regrowth downstream to AMPK. We also showed that swimming exercise induces nuclear localization of DAF-16 in an AMPK-dependent manner. Our results showed that neuronal and non-neuronal arms of AMPK signalling play an integrative role in response to physical exercise to promote functional recovery after axon injury.

Significance statementFinding ways to promote functional recovery after accidental damage to the nervous system has been challenging as adult neurons lose the capability to regenerate. Rehabilitation therapy is the most promising approach to improve the health condition of patients with nervous system injury. Even in the roundworm C. elegans, axon regeneration could be enhanced through swimming exercise, which is mediated by the metabolic energy sensor AMP Kinase. In this study, using sensory neurons in worm, we found that PAR-4/ Liver kinase B1 acts upstream of AMPK. Whereas, the transcription factor DAF-16/ FOXO and the transcriptional co-regulator MDT-15 act as downstream signalling arms in muscle and neuron tissues. Excitingly, both of these arms could be harnessed through agonist-mediated activation of AMPK to promote functional recovery in adulthood.

">Cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in category-selectivity in visual cortex following pediatric cortical resection</a></h4>

              
                The topographic organization of category-selective responses in human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) and its relationship to regions subserving language functions is remarkably uniform across individuals. This arrangement is thought to result from the clustering of neurons responding to similar inputs, constrained by intrinsic architecture and tuned by experience. We examined the malleability of this organization in individuals with unilateral resection of VOTC during childhood for the management of drug-resistant epilepsy. In cross-sectional and longitudinal functional imaging studies, we compared the topography and neural representations of 17 category-selective regions in individuals with a VOTC resection, a  control patient with resection outside VOTC, and typically developing matched controls. We demonstrated both adherence to and deviation from the standard topography and uncovered fine-grained competitive dynamics between word- and face-selectivity over time in the single, preserved VOTC. The findings elucidate the nature and extent of cortical plasticity and highlight the potential for remodeling of extrastriate architecture and function.

TeaserAfter pediatric cortical resection, deviations from the constraints of standard topography in visual cortex reflect plasticity.

">Development of a real-time neural controller using an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model</a></h4>

              
                Here we present our development of a novel real-time neural controller based on an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model, designed for volitional control of robots and computers. Our controller uniquely enables motion control during both isometric and non-isometric muscle contractions. We address several key challenges in EMG control system design, including accuracy, latency, and robustness. Our approach combines EMG signal processing, neural activation dynamics, and Hill-type muscle modeling to translate neural commands into muscle forces, which can enhance robustness against electrode variability and signal noise. Additionally, we integrate muscle activation dynamics with impedance control, inspired by the human motor control system, for smooth and adaptive interactions. As an initial proof of concept, we demonstrated that our system could control a robot actuator across a range of movements, both static and dynamic, and at different operating speeds, achieving high reference tracking performance and state-of-the-art processing times of 2.9 ms, important for real-time embedded computing. This research helps lay the groundwork for next-generation neural-machine interfaces that are fast, accurate, and adaptable to diverse users and control applications.

">Hypocretin receptor 1 blockade early in abstinence reduces future demand for cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Relapse to cocaine use after abstinence remains a significant challenge for treating cocaine use disorder. While the mechanisms of relapse are still under investigation, adaptations in mesolimbic dopamine systems may contribute to cocaine craving and propensity for relapse. Current pharmacological treatments targeting dopamine systems are often intolerable and may have abuse potential. Therefore, identifying novel pharmacological targets for cocaine use disorder is crucial. The hypocretin/orexin system has been shown to regulate cocaine-associated behavior and dopamine transmission. Our previous studies indicated that the hypocretin receptor 1 antagonist, RTIOX-276, reduced motivation for cocaine and attenuated dopamine responses to cocaine. Importantly, the effects of RTIOX-276 on dopamine transmission persisted for at least 24 hours, suggesting lasting effects of hypocretin receptor antagonism. Here, we hypothesized that a single RTIOX-276 treatment would reduce motivation for cocaine and normalize dopamine transmission after abstinence. Rats were pre-assessed for cocaine consumption and motivation using a within-session threshold schedule before intermittent access exposure to cocaine. Rats were subsequently treated with RTIOX-276 on the first day of a 7-day abstinence period, after which they were reassessed for cocaine consumption and motivation or examined for dopamine transmission using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in nucleus accumbens core slices. We found that a single treatment with RTIOX-276 on the first day of abstinence reduced motivation for cocaine and normalized aberrant dopamine uptake observed following intermittent access to cocaine. These findings suggest that hypocretin receptor 1 may be a viable target for reducing motivation for cocaine through alterations in dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens.

">Multimodal single-cell analyses reveal molecular markers of neuronal senescence in human drug-resistant epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The histopathological neurons in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy exhibit aberrant cytoarchitecture and imbalanced synaptic circuit function. However, the gene expression changes of these neurons remain unknown, making it difficult for the diagnosis or to dissect the mechanism of drug-resistant epilepsy. By integrating whole-cell patch clamp recording and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches, we identified a transcriptionally distinct subset of cortical pyramidal neurons. These neurons highly expressed genes CDKN1A (P21), CCL2 and NFKBIA that associated with mTOR pathway, inflammatory response and cellular senescence. We confirmed the expression of senescent marker genes in a subpopulation of cortical pyramidal neurons with enlarged soma size in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy. We further revealed the expression of senescent cell markers P21, P53, COX2, {gamma}-H2AX, {beta}-Gal and reduction of nuclear integrity marker Lamin B1 in histopathological neurons in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy patients with different pathologies, but not in control brain tissue with no history of epilepsy. Additionally, chronic, but not acute, epileptic seizures induced senescent markers expression in cortical neurons in mouse models of drug-resistant epilepsy. These results provide important molecular markers for histopathological neurons and new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of drug-resistant epilepsy.

">Behavioral and genetic markers of susceptibility to escalate fentanyl intake.</a></h4>

              
                Background: The ''loss of control'' over drug consumption, present in opioid use disorder (OUD) and known as escalation of intake, is well-established in preclinical rodent models. However, little is known about how antecedent behavioral characteristics, such as valuation of hedonic reinforcers prior to drug use, may impact the trajectory of fentanyl intake over time. Moreover, it is unclear if distinct escalation phenotypes may be driven by genetic markers predictive of OUD susceptibility. Methods: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=63) were trained in a sucrose reinforcement task using a progressive ratio schedule. Individual differences in responsivity to sucrose were hypothesized to predict escalation of fentanyl intake. Rats underwent daily 1-h acquisition sessions for i.v. fentanyl self-administration (2.5  g/kg; FR1) for 7 days, followed by 21 6-h escalation sessions, then tissue from prefrontal cortex was collected for RNA sequencing and qPCR. Latent growth curve and group-based trajectory modeling were used, respectively, to evaluate the association between sucrose reinforcement and fentanyl self-administration and to identify whether distinct escalation phenotypes can be linked to gene expression patterns. Results: Sucrose breakpoints were not predictive of fentanyl acquisition nor change during escalation, but did predict fentanyl intake on the first day of extended access to fentanyl. Permutation analyses did not identify associations between behavior and single gene expression when evaluated overall, or between our ascertained phenotypes. However, weighted genome correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) determined several gene modules linked to escalated fentanyl intake, including genes coding for voltage-gated potassium channels, calcium channels, and genes involved in excitatory synaptic signaling. Transcription factor analyses identified EZH2 and JARID2 as potential transcriptional regulators associated with escalated fentanyl intake. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) term categories were also generated and positively associated with terms relating to substance use disorders. Discussion: Escalation of opioid intake is largely distinct from motivation for natural reward, such as sucrose. Further, the gene networks associated with fentanyl escalation suggest that engagement of select molecular pathways distinguish individuals with ''addiction prone'' behavioral endophenotypes, potentially representing druggable targets for opioid use disorder. Our extended in silico identification of SNPs and transcription factors associated with the ''addiction prone'' high escalating rats highlights the importance of integrating findings from translational preclinical models. Through a precision medicine approach, our results may aid in the development of patient-centered treatment options for those with OUD.

">Perceptual choice and motor signals in mouse somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory cortex activity relates both to sensation and movement, reflecting their intimate relationship, but the extent and nature of sensory-motor interactions in the somatosensory cortex remain unclear. Here, we investigated perception-related sensory and motor signals in the whisker areas of mouse primary (wS1) and secondary (wS2) somatosensory cortices. We recorded neuronal activity while mice performed a whisker detection task using two alternative lickports, one each to indicate the presence or absence of a whisker deflection on a given trial. One group of mice reported the presence of the whisker stimulus by licking at the port on the same ("congruent") side of the animal as the stimulated whisker, whereas a second group of mice did so by licking at the opposite ("incongruent") side. Activity of single neurons in wS1 and wS2 correlated with perceptual choice. This choice-related activity was enhanced when responding to the congruent side. wS2 neurons projecting along two output pathways---to wS1 or to whisker secondary motor cortex, wM2---also showed choice-related activity, but differed in their dependence on congruence and in the effects of optogenetic manipulation. Thus, somatosensory cortex contains pathway- and action-specific choice-related activity.

">Goal-Directed Learning in Cortical Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Experimental neuroscience techniques are advancing rapidly, with major recent developments in high-density electrophysiology and targeted electrical stimulation. In combination with these techniques, cortical organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells show great promise as in vitro models of brain development and function. Although sensory input is vital to neurodevelopment in vivo, few studies have explored the effect of meaningful input to in vitro neural cultures over time. In this work, we demonstrate the first example of goal-directed learning in brain organoids. We developed a closed-loop electrophysiology framework to embody mouse cortical organoids into a simulated dynamical task (the inverted pendulum problem known as "Cartpole") and evaluate learning through specific training signals. Longitudinal experiments enabled by this framework illuminate how different methods of selecting training signals enable improvement on the tasks. We found that for most organoids, training signals chosen by artificial reinforcement learning yield better performance on the task than randomly chosen training signals or the absence of a training signal. This systematic approach to studying learning mechanisms in vitro opens new possibilities for therapeutic interventions and biological computation.

">Biophysical modeling of thalamic reticular nucleus subpopulations and their differential contribution to network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The burst firing mode of thalamic reticular neurons plays a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of sleep rhythms and is implicated in sleep-related deficits characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Although several models of reticular neurons have been developed to date, we currently lack a biophysically detailed model able to accurately reproduce the heterogeneity of burst firing observed experimentally. Using electrophysiology recordings of patch-clamped fluorescently tagged Spp1+ and Ecel1+ reticular neurons, we leverage a previously established statistical framework to introduce differentiation of cell types in model thalamic reticular neurons. We developed a population of biophysically detailed models of thalamic reticular neurons that capture the diversity of their firing properties, particularly their ability to generate rebound bursts. These models incorporate key ion channels, such as T-type Ca and small conductance potassium channels (SK), and enable systematic investigations into the impact of these channels on single-cell dynamics. By integrating these models into a thalamic microcircuit, we demonstrate that T-type Ca and SK channel conductances have opposing effects on spindle oscillations. We identify a simple relationship between these conductances and the peak firing frequency of spindles, maintained across circuits with mixed reticular neuron populations, providing a framework for understanding how ion channel expression influences thalamic network dynamics. Collectively, these models establish a foundation for relating intrinsic cellular properties of reticular cell populations to network-level activity in both healthy and pathological conditions.

">Relationship between Brain and Body Temperature in Anesthetized Animals Measured by Ultralocal Thermometry</a></h4>

              
                Temperature is one of the least studied biophysical characteristics of the brain, although both the rate of biochemical reactions and the electrical activity of nervous tissue directly depend on it. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between brain and body temperatures in anesthetized animals. Simultaneous measurement of brain and body temperature (rectally) was carried out at ambient temperature controlled with a thermal mat. The temperature of the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex was measured by ultralocal thermometry using a diamond thermometer. Under anesthesia, the body and brain temperature dropped to 27 C (4 degrees above ambient temperature). When the thermal mat was turned on, the brain and body began to heat up synchronously. The brain initially lagged behind, but when the critical temperature was reached, it began to release heat in quantities exceeding the influx from the blood, reaching physiological values of 37C. A reverse experiment with decreasing the temperature of the thermal mat showed a similar picture: a synchronous start of the decrease, but with reverse dynamics. Thus, we can distinguish two phases of the brain's reaction to external heating: passive - when neuronal activity is decreased, and active - after internal regulatory mechanisms are triggered, which, in its turn, slows down the temperature drop. In general, the data obtained in the present work indicate that the temperature of neural tissue is not linearly related to body temperature.

">Temporal shift in task factor influence across the stretch reflex</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical perturbations applied to the arm can elicit reflexive actions. These rapid corrective responses include the stretch reflex, which consists of different components: the short-latency reflex (SLR) as well as the early and late long-latency reflex (LLR). In this study, we explore how different task factors dynamically influence these reflex components in the context of a specific delayed-reach paradigm. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), we analysed reflex responses from seven muscles actuating the right arm to examine the effects of mechanical load, preparatory delay, perturbation and target direction, as well as their two-factor interactions. The MLR analysis shows that our delayed-reach tasks engaged shoulder girdle muscles, whereas the biceps and triceps primarily acted as stabilizing muscles, with rapid responses triggered regardless of perturbation direction. Specifically, our analyses show that the earliest corrective response, the SLR, exhibited some task/target-dependent modulation particularly in muscles of the shoulder girdle, although background (pre-)loading decreased this modulation. The SLR was primarily influenced by the main factors Load and Perturbation, along with the interaction Load x Perturbation. Perturbations aligned with the load direction were associated with increased electromyographic (EMG) activity across all examined muscles. While there was a small but significant effect of load during the early LLR, this effect diminished by the late LLR epoch. Task-dependent modulation was most pronounced at the late LLR epoch, suggesting greater top-down modulation of this reflex component. In particular, the late LLR was shaped by the factors Perturbation and Target, as well as the interaction Perturbation x Target. Targets and perturbations in opposing directions resulted in heightened EMG activity, and shoulder muscles exhibited stronger LLR responses for targets located farther along the muscle shortening direction. Across all reflex epochs, a longer preparatory delay (750 ms) was associated with higher EMG activity.

">Phase reset dynamics of memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Human and animal studies have implicated oscillatory reset following a behaviorally relevant stimulus in learning and memory function. Here we asked whether phase reset predicts the dynamics of memory encoding for subsequently recalled and forgotten items. Our dataset comprised 188 neurosurgical patients (99 male, 89 female) who studied lists of common words for a subsequent delayed free recall test. We observed significant 3-21Hz overall phase reset widespread throughout the brain in the 125-500ms interval following stimulus presentation for both subsequently recalled and forgotten items. We found that the increased recalls of the primacy effect correlated significantly and exclusively with theta phase reset from 3-7Hz throughout the brain. When controlling for serial position effects and examining the phase consistency differences of subsequently recalled and forgotten items, we identified both a theta (3-6Hz) and an alpha (9-14Hz) component of phase reset. Examined separately, early list items revealed a significant theta phase reset difference, while later list items revealed a significant alpha phase reset difference for subsequently recalled items. In regional analyses, the lateral temporal cortex exhibited a significant theta phase reset difference, while the prefrontal cortex revealed both a significant theta and a significant alpha phase reset difference for subsequently recalled items. These findings support the view that oscillatory reset serves an important role in encoding new episodic associations, and reveal differing oscillatory mechanisms across theta and alpha bands for serial position effects of phase reset versus serial position controlled subsequent recall.

">Space- and object-based attention in patientswith a single hemisphere following childhood resection</a></h4>

              
                The neural processes underlying attentional processing are typically lateralized in adults, with spatial attention associated with the right hemisphere (RH) and object-based attention with the left hemisphere (LH). Using a modified two-rectangle attention paradigm, we compared the lateralization profiles of individuals with childhood hemispherectomy (either LH or RH) and age-matched, typically developing controls. Although patients exhibited slower reaction times (RTs) compared to controls, both groups benefited from valid attentional cueing. However, patients experienced significantly higher costs for invalid trials, reflected by larger RT differences between validly and invalidly cued targets. This was true for invalid trials on both cued and uncued objects, probes of object- and space-based attentional processes, respectively. Notably, controls showed no significant RT cost differences between invalidly cued locations on cued versus uncued objects. By contrast, patients exhibited greater RT costs for targets on uncued versus cued objects, suggesting greater difficulty shifting attention across objects. We explore potential explanations for this group difference and the lack of difference between patients with LH or RH resection. These findings enhance our understanding of spatial and object-based attention in typical development and reveal how significant neural injury affects the development of attentional systems in the LH and RH.

">Salience Network Segregation and Symptom Profiles in Psychosis Prodrome Subgroups</a></h4>

              
                Background: Understanding neurobiological similarities between individuals with prodromal psychosis symptoms can improve early identification and intervention strategies. Here, we aimed to (i) identify neurobiologically similar groups by integrating resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal symptom data and (ii) discern discriminating symptom profiles and brain connectivity patterns in the identified sub-groups. Methods: Our sample (N=922) was extracted from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and included individuals ages 12-21 years with fMRI and self-reported psychopathology data. Analyses were conducted separately for youth and early adults. We first constructed a two-layer network using pair-wise similarity distances between participants based on resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal positive psychosis symptoms. We then performed community detection via a multiplex stochastic block model to identify subject clusters. Results: We identified 2 blocks or communities for both the youth (n=458 and 179) and early adult (n=173 and 112) groups. Connection parameter estimates of the neuroimaging layer were nearly identical between blocks for both age groups whereas there was significant variation for the symptom layer. Psychopathology symptom and brain system segregation profiles were consistent across age groups. The youth block (n=458) with higher salience network segregation values had higher mean scores for prodromal symptoms. However, the early adult block (n=173) with lower salience network segregation had higher mean prodromal scores. Conclusions: By integrating global similarities in brain connectivity and prodromal symptoms, we identified distinct subgroups. These groups show differences in symptom profiles and network segregation in youth and early adults, indicating significant variations in developmental paths for psychosis spectrum.

">Alterations in topology, cost and dynamics of gamma-band EEG functional networks in a preclinical model of traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of disability leading to multiple sequelae in cognitive, sensory, and physical domains, including post-traumatic epilepsy. Despite extensive research, our understanding of its impact on macroscopic brain circuitry remains incomplete. We analyzed electrophysiological functional connectomes in the gamma band using a preclinical model of blast-induced traumatic brain injury over multiple time points after injury. We revealed differences in small-world propensity and rich-club structure compared to age-matched controls, indicating functional reorganization following injury. We further investigated cost-efficiency trade-offs, propose a computationally efficient normalization procedure for quantifying cost of spatially embedded networks that controls for connectivity strength differences, and suggest metabolic drivers as a candidate for the observed differences. Furthermore, we employed a brain-wide computational model of seizure dynamics and attribute brain reorganization to a homeostatic mechanism of activity regulation with the potential unintended consequence of driving generalized seizures. Finally, we demonstrated post-injury hyperexcitability that manifests as an increase in sound-evoked response amplitudes at the cortical level. Our work characterizes for the first time gamma-band functional network reorganization in a model of brain injury and proposes potential causes of these changes, thus identifying targets for future therapeutic interventions.

">Loom response in mouse superior colliculus depends on sensorimotor context</a></h4>

              
                Visual motion is produced both by an organism's movement through the world, and by objects moving in the world such as potential predators. Choosing appropriate behaviour therefore requires organisms to distinguish these sources of visual motion. Here we asked how mice integrate self-movement with looming visual motion by combining virtual reality and neural recordings from superior colliculus (SC), a brain area important in visually-guided approach and avoidance behaviours. We first measured locomotion behaviour and neural activity while animals approached an object in virtual reality, and while the same object loomed at them. In both cases, vision dominated activity in superficial layers (SCs), while locomotion had more influence on activity in intermediate layers (SCim). In addition, animals instinctively slowed their locomotion when nearing the object, or when the object neared them. To directly test animals' ability to distinguish self- from object motion we replayed the visual images generated during object approach. Locomotion behaviour often changed during replay, showing animals are able to establish if visual motion is matched to their self-movement. Further, decoders trained on locomotion behaviour, or on population activity in SC, particularly in SCim, were able to reliably discriminate epochs of replay and object approach. We conclude that both mouse behaviour and SC activity encode whether looming visual motion arises from self- or object movement, with implications for understanding sensorimotor coordination in dynamic environments.

">Sensor Movement Drives Emergent Attention and Scalability in Active Neural Cellular Automata</a></h4>

              
                The brain's distributed architecture has inspired numerous artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly through its neocortical organization. However, current AI approaches largely overlook a crucial aspect of biological intelligence: active sensing - the deliberate movement of sensory organs to explore the environment. To explore how sensor movement impacts behavior in classification tasks, we introduce the Active Neural Cellular Automata (ANCA), a neocortex-inspired model with movable sensors. Active sensing naturally emerges in the ANCA, with belief-informed exploration and attentive behavior to salient information, without adding explicit attention mechanisms. Active sensing both simplifies classification tasks and leads to a highly scalable system. This enables ANCAs to be smaller than the image size without losing information and enables fault tolerance to damaged sensors. Overall, our work provides insight to how distributed architectures can interact with movement, opening new avenues for adaptive AI systems in embodied agents.

">The heart rate dynamics and antioxidant capacity under cognitive load in Obsessive-Compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                The research of the oxidants-antioxidants homeostasis and its connection to autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively uncharted field of study. We recruited 31 patients diagnosed with OCD and 29 healthy volunteers to analyze their saliva antioxidant capacity before and after a three-block behavioral task with cognitive and emotional load, during which we assessed heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) patterns. We found that the OCD group had a significantly lower antioxidant capacity (AOC) and showed no increase in AOC after the cognitive task as compared with healthy volunteers. The notable negative correlation between HR and AOC changes led us to select two subgroups inside the OCD and control group: one with high HR and another with low HR. The AOC changes for OCD and healthy participants with high HR were similar, while OCD sub-group with low HR exhibited significantly different changes in AOC compared with the control group. Although HRV did not show a correlation with AOC, the OCD group demonstrated substantially higher increase of very low frequencies (VLF) of 24 HRV during the cognitive task performance and significantly elevated low frequency powers of HRV expressed in normal units (LFnu). OCD sub-group with lower HR exhibited higher LFnu compared to both the patient and the control group with high HR. Our findings imply that OCD patients with elevated sympathetic tone of ANS reflected by initially increased HR show more adaptive AOC to cognitive load.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Postpartum depression and postpartum depression with anxiety, which are highly prevalent and debilitating disorders, become a growing public concern. The high overlap on the symptomatic and neurobiological levels led to ongoing debates about their diagnostic and neurobiological uniqueness. Delineating the shared and disorder-specific intrinsic functional connectivities and their causal interactions is fundamental to precision diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we recruited 138 participants including 45 postpartum depression, 31 postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety patients, and 62 healthy postnatal women with age ranging from 23 to 40 years. We combined independent component analysis, resting-state functional connectivity, and Granger causality analysis to reveal the abnormal intrinsic functional couplings and their causal interactions in postpartum depression and postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety from a large-scale brain network perspective. We found that they exhibited widespread abnormalities in intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities. Importantly, the intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities within or between the fronto-parietal network, default model network, ventral and dorsal attention network, sensorimotor network, and visual network, especially the functional imbalances between primary and association cortices could serve as effective neural markers to differentiate postpartum depression, postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety, and healthy controls. Our findings provide the initial evidence for shared and disorder-specific intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities for postpartum depression and postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety, which provide an underlying neuropathological basis for postpartum depression or postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety to facilitate precision diagnosis and therapy in future studies.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Value-based decision-making involves weighing costs and benefits. The activity of the medial prefrontal cortex reflects cost–benefit assessments, and the mediodorsal thalamus, reciprocally connected with the medial prefrontal cortex, has increasingly been recognized as an active partner in decision-making. However, the specific role of the interaction between the mediodorsal thalamus and the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating the neuronal activity underlying how costs and benefits influence decision-making remains largely unexplored. We investigated this by training the rats to perform a self-determined decision-making task, where longer nose poke durations resulted in correspondingly larger rewards. Our results showed that the inactivation of either the medial prefrontal cortex or the mediodorsal thalamus significantly impaired rat to invest more nose poke duration for larger rewards. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex pathway enhanced rats’ motivation for larger rewards, whereas inhibition of this pathway resulted in decreased motivation. Notably, we identified a specific population of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex that exhibited firing patterns correlated with motivation, and these neurons were modulated by the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex projection. These findings suggest that the motivation during decision-making is encoded primarily by activity of particular neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and indicate the crucial role of the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex pathway in maintaining motivation.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Innovative therapies are needed to reduce disability, facilitate activities of daily living, and improve the quality of life in patients with stroke. Non-invasive methods of stimulating the peripheral and central nervous system are increasingly being used to enhance the effects of existing therapies in stroke rehabilitation. One potentially relevant method for achieving greater improvement is repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS). This randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Peripheral MAgnetic stimulation in patients with spastic hemiparesis after Stroke Trial (REPMAST), will investigate whether rPMS improves upper extremity function, spasticity, and activities of daily living in patients with stroke compared with neuromuscular stimulation (NMS). Methods: REPMAST is an interventional, randomized controlled single-blinded study. Patients with subacute stroke are randomized to receive rPMS or NMS five days a week for three weeks in addition to standard rehabilitation therapy. The primary outcome is the change in the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity between the beginning and end of the stimulation sessions. Secondary outcomes include changes in the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, the Timed Up and Go Test, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Tardieu Scale. A total sample size of 138 patients (69 in each group) is required to investigate the superiority of rPMS compared with NMS. Conclusions: The aim of this RCT is to provide evidence for an effective peripheral stimulation treatment for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this study is to shed light on activity-based prospective memory upon the awakening and its association with motor sleep inertia in different phenotypes of insomnia disorder. Methods: To this end, 67 patients with insomnia and 51 healthy controls took part in the study. After enrollment, previously proposed actigraphic quantitative criteria were adopted, and the following phenotypes of insomnia disorder were observed in the patient sample: sleep onset (n = 12), maintenance (n = 19), mixed (n = 17), and negative misperception (n = 19). Each participant had used the Micro Motionlogger Watch (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) actigraph for one week. Actigraphic recording allowed for a description of both the activity-based prospective memory performance upon the awakening&amp;amp;mdash;by computing the time interval between sleep end and the time participants actually remembered to push the event-marker button of the actigraph&amp;amp;mdash;and the motor sleep inertia, i.e., the mean motor activity, minute-by-minute, in the first 60 min after sleep end in the morning. Results: Compared to healthy controls, a longer time interval was observed between sleep end and activity-based prospective memory performance in patients with mixed and maintenance insomnia. Moreover, a significant association was highlighted between motor sleep inertia and the activity-based prospective memory performance: higher levels of motor activity in those who remembered to perform the memory task early after sleep end, that spread over a longer time interval in maintenance and mixed insomnia. Conclusions: Overall, the present results seem to highlight a more marked cognitive inertia in patients with mixed and maintenance insomnia as well as a significant association between motor and cognitive inertia that spreads over a different time interval according to the phenotype of insomnia.</p>

	<p>Background: In this study, we aimed to comparatively evaluate the morphology of internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcations with and without aneurysms and identify risk factors for aneurysm development that are associated with the bifurcation geometry. Method: In this two-center study, the computerized tomography angiography data of 1512 patients were evaluated. The study included 64 (4.2%) patients with ICA bifurcation aneurysms (ICAbifAn) and patients with anterior circulation aneurysms (non-ICAbifAn). ICA (P1) was defined as the parent artery, and the middle (M1) and anterior (A1) cerebral artery segments were defined as daughter arteries. We measured the diameters of the P1, M1, and A1 and their ratios (BifSR) to identify the risk factors. In addition, we calculated the bifurcation angle in two ways by measuring all angles between the P1 and daughter arteries and compared these two methods. The first method was the angle between the M1 and A1 (&amp;amp;alpha;), and the second was the sum of the angles between the P1 and daughter arteries (BifA). Result: A total of 163 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study: 58 patients in the ICAbifAn group and 105 patients in the non-ICAbifAn group. A univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the P1, BifSR, &amp;amp;alpha;, and BifA measurements were significant predictors of aneurysm formation. However, after a multivariate analysis, only the BifA angle retained its significance (OR, 0.911 (0.877&amp;amp;ndash;0.946), p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the ROC curve, the optimal BifA threshold for accurately differentiating between an ICAbifAn and non-aneurysmal bifurcation was 210&amp;amp;deg; (area under the curve (AUC), 0.81; sensitivity, 69%; and specificity, 87%). The &amp;amp;alpha; angle had an AUC of 0.68. Conclusions: These results suggest that bifurcation geometry plays a significant role in the likelihood of aneurysm formation. We also showed that the BifA was more predictive of aneurysm formation than the &amp;amp;alpha; angle.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) is a common disease in childhood, but its impact on the vestibular system remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of rAOM on balance and vestibular function in pediatric patients. Methods: A total of 55 children, aged 8 years (25 males and 30 females), with a documented history of rAOM, no AOM episodes in the past year, and no previous ear surgery were assessed. Static posturography was used to assess postural instability, measuring sway area (SX, mm2) under four conditions: eyes open and eyes closed, with and without foam pads. Vestibular function was evaluated using the video head impulse test (v-HIT) to quantify vestibulo&amp;amp;ndash;ocular reflex (VOR) gain and corrective saccades across all six semicircular canals. Results: Children with a history of rAOM demonstrated significantly greater postural instability than healthy controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 for all test conditions). The number of AOM episodes was the primary factor influencing balance dysfunction, with children who had more than eight episodes showing the most pronounced deficits in postural stability (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In some cases, the v-HIT revealed hypofunction in the right anterior (14.5%), left posterior (7.3%), left lateral (5.5%), left anterior (3.6%), and right posterior (3.6%) semicircular canals. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that rAOM can lead to lasting balance and vestibular dysfunction, highlighting the importance of early monitoring and potential rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background and objective: Staging Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) with a novel simple classification called MNCD, based on four axes (Motor; Non-motor; Cognition; Dependency) and five stages, correlated with disease severity, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; strain and burden. Our aim was to apply the MNCD classification in advanced PD patients treated with device-aided therapy (DAT). Patients and Methods: A multicenter observational retrospective study of the first patients to start the levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) in Spain was performed (LECIPARK study). The MNCD total score (from 0 to 12) and MNCD stages (from 1 to 5) were collected by the neurologist at V0 (before starting LECIG) and V2 (follow-up visit). Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s signed rank and Marginal Homogeneity tests were applied to compare changes from V0 to V2. Results: Sixty-seven PD patients (58.2% males; 69.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.3 years old) with a mean disease duration of 14.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.5 years were included. The mean treatment duration (V2) was 172.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 105.2 days. At V0, patients were classified as in stage 2 (35.8%), 3 (46.3%) or 4 (17.9%). The frequency of patients in stage 4 decreased to 9% at V2 (p = 0.001). The MNCD total score decreased from 6.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.94 at V0 to 5.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.23 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). From V0 to V2, the motor (M; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and non-motor symptom (N; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) burden decreased, and autonomy for the activities of daily living (D; p = 0.005) improved. Conclusions: The MNCD classification could be useful to classify advanced PD patients and to monitor the response to a DAT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/50/e0166242024?rss=1">The Relationship between White Matter Architecture and Language Lateralization in the Healthy Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interhemispheric anatomical differences have long been thought to be related to language lateralization. Previous studies have explored whether asymmetries in the diffusion characteristics of white matter language tracts are consistent with language lateralization. These studies, typically with smaller cohorts, yielded mixed results. This study investigated whether connectomic analysis of quantitative anisotropy (QA) and shape features of white matter tracts across the whole brain are associated with language lateralization. We analyzed 1,040 healthy individuals (562 females) from the Human Connectome Project database. Hemispheric language dominance for each participant was quantified using a laterality quotient (LQ) derived from fMRI activation in regions of interest (ROIs) associated with a language comprehension task compared against a math task. A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between structural asymmetry and functional lateralization. Connectometry revealed a significant negative correlation between LQs and QA of corpus callosum tracts, indicating that higher QA in these regions is associated with bilateral and right hemisphere language representation in frontal and temporal regions. Left language laterality in the temporal lobe was significantly associated with longer right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and forceps minor tracts. These results suggest that diffusion measures of microstructural architecture as well as geometrical features of reconstructed white matter tracts play a role in language lateralization. People with increased dependence on the right or both frontal hemispheres for language processing may have more developed commissural fibers, which may support more efficient interhemispheric communication.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/50/e0215242024?rss=1">Restoring Compromised Cl- in D2 Neurons of a Huntingtons Disease Mouse Model Rescues Motor Disability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, characterized by significant neurodegeneration of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Early stages of the disease are characterized by the loss of dopamine 2 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D2 MSNs) followed by degeneration of dopamine 1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1 MSNs), leading to aberrant basal ganglia signaling. While the early degeneration of D2 MSNs and impaired GABAergic transmission are well-documented, potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a key regulator of intracellular chloride (Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>), and therefore GABAergic signaling, has not been characterized in D1 and D2 MSNs in HD. We aimed to investigate whether Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the early degeneration of D2 MSNs in male and female symptomatic R6/2 mice. We used electrophysiology to record the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (<I>E</I><SUB>GABA</SUB>), a read-out for the efficacy of Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation, in striatal D1 and D2 MSNs and their corresponding output structures. During the early symptomatic phase (P55&ndash;P65), Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> impairments were observed in D2 MSNs in R6/2 mice, with no change in D1 MSNs. Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was also dysfunctional in the globus pallidus externa, resulting in GABA-mediated excitation. When we overexpressed KCC2 in D2 MSNs using AAV-mediated delivery, we delayed the onset of motor impairments in R6/2 mice. We demonstrate that Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> homeostasis is differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of D2 MSNs during HD progression.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated calcium influx triggers the induction and initial expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we report that in male rodents, ion flux-independent (metabotropic) NMDAR signaling is critical for a third step in the production of enduring LTP, i.e., cytoskeletal changes that stabilize the activity-induced synaptic modifications. Surprisingly, females rely upon estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) for the metabotropic NMDAR operations used by males. Blocking NMDAR channels with MK-801 eliminated LTP expression in hippocampal field CA1 of both sexes but left intact theta burst stimulation (TBS)-induced actin polymerization within dendritic spines. A selective antagonist (Ro25-6981) of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit had minimal effects on synaptic responses but blocked actin polymerization and LTP consolidation in males only. Conversely, an ER&alpha; antagonist thoroughly disrupted TBS-induced actin polymerization and LTP in females while having no evident effect in males. In an episodic memory paradigm, Ro25-6981 prevented acquisition of spatial locations by males but not females, whereas an ER&alpha; antagonist blocked acquisition in females but not males. Sex differences in LTP consolidation were accompanied by pronounced differences in episodic memory in tasks involving minimal (for learning) cue sampling. Males did better on acquisition of spatial information whereas females had much higher scores than males on tests for acquisition of the identity of cues (episodic "what") and the order in which the cues were sampled (episodic "when"). We propose that sex differences in synaptic processes used to stabilize LTP result in differential encoding of the basic elements of episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Protocadherins, a family of adhesion molecules with a crucial role in cell&ndash;cell interactions, have emerged as key players in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In particular, growing evidence links genetic alterations in the protocadherin 9 (<I>PCDH9</I>) gene with autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, <I>Pcdh9</I> deletion induces neuronal defects in the mouse somatosensory cortex, accompanied by sensorimotor and memory impairment. However, the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of <I>PCDH9</I> in the brain remain largely unknown, particularly concerning its impact on brain pathology. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of PCDH9&rsquo;s role in the male mouse hippocampus at the ultrastructural, biochemical, transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and network levels. We show that PCDH9 mainly localizes at glutamatergic synapses and its expression peaks in the first week after birth, a crucial time window for synaptogenesis. Strikingly, <I>Pcdh9</I> KO neurons exhibit oversized presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic density in the CA1. Synapse overgrowth is sustained by the widespread upregulation of synaptic genes, as revealed by single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), and the dysregulation of key drivers of synapse morphogenesis, including the SHANK2/CORTACTIN pathway. At the functional level, these structural and transcriptional abnormalities result in increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) and reduced network activity in the CA1 of <I>Pcdh9</I> KO mice. In conclusion, our work uncovers <I>Pcdh9</I>&rsquo;s pivotal role in shaping the morphology and function of CA1 excitatory synapses, thereby modulating glutamatergic transmission within hippocampal circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/50/e0532242024?rss=1">Alpha Traveling Waves during Working Memory: Disentangling Bottom-Up Gating and Top-Down Gain Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>While previous works established the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations during working memory maintenance, it remains an open question whether such an inhibitory control is a top-down process. Here, we attempted to disentangle this issue by considering the spatiotemporal component of waves in the alpha band, i.e., alpha traveling waves. We reanalyzed two pre-existing and open-access EEG datasets (<I>N</I> = 180, 90 males, 80 females, 10 unknown) where participants performed lateralized, visual delayed match-to-sample working memory tasks. In the first dataset, the distractor load was manipulated (2, 4, or 6), whereas in the second dataset, the memory span varied between 1, 3, and 6 items. We focused on the propagation of alpha waves on the anterior-posterior axis during the retention period. Our results reveal an increase in alpha-band forward waves as the distractor load increased, but also an increase in forward waves and a decrease in backward waves as the memory set size increased. Our results also showed a lateralization effect: alpha forward waves exhibited a more pronounced increase in the hemisphere contralateral to the distractors, whereas the reduction in backward waves was stronger in the hemisphere contralateral to the targets. In short, the forward waves were regulated by distractors, whereas targets inversely modulated backward waves. Such a dissociation of goal-related and goal-irrelevant physiological signals suggests the coexistence of bottom-up and top-down inhibitory processes: alpha forward waves might convey a gating effect driven by distractor load, while backward waves may represent direct top-down gain control of downstream visual areas.</p>

                <p>Mutations in human <I>VPS4A</I> are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, including motor delays and defective muscle tone. <I>VPS4A</I> encodes a AAA-ATPase required for membrane scission, but how mutations in <I>VPS4A</I> lead to impaired control of motor function is not known. Here we identified a mutation in zebrafish <I>vps4a</I>, T248I, that affects sensorimotor transformation. Biochemical analyses indicate that the T248I mutation reduces the ATPase activity of Vps4a and disassembly of ESCRT filaments, which mediate membrane scission. Consistent with the role for Vps4a in exosome biogenesis, <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae have enlarged endosomal compartments in the CNS and decreased numbers of circulating exosomes in brain ventricles. Resembling the central form of hypotonia in <I>VPS4A</I> patients, motor neurons and muscle cells are functional in mutant zebrafish. Both somatosensory and vestibular inputs robustly evoke tail and eye movements, respectively. In contrast, optomotor responses, vestibulospinal, and acoustic startle reflexes are absent or strongly impaired in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae, indicating a greater sensitivity of these circuits to the T248I mutation. ERG recordings revealed intensity-dependent deficits in the retina, and in vivo calcium imaging of the auditory pathway identified a moderate reduction in afferent neuron activity, partially accounting for the severe motor impairments in mutant larvae. Further investigation of central pathways in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> mutants showed that activation of descending vestibulospinal and midbrain motor command neurons by sensory cues is strongly reduced. Our results suggest that defects in sensorimotor transformation underlie the profound yet selective effects on motor reflexes resulting from the loss of membrane scission mediated by Vps4a.</p>

                <p>Cognitive control is engaged by working memory processes and high-demand situations like antisaccade, where one must suppress a prepotent response. While it is known to be supported by the frontoparietal control network, how intra- and interareal dynamics contribute to cognitive control processes remains unclear. <I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play a key role in prefrontal dynamics that support cognitive control. NMDAR antagonists, such as ketamine, are known to alter task-related prefrontal activities and impair cognitive performance. However, the role of NMDAR in cognitive control-related frontoparietal dynamics remains underexplored. Here, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and single-unit activities from the lateral prefrontal (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortices (PPC) in two male macaque monkeys during a rule-based antisaccade task, with both rule-visible (RV) and rule-memorized (RM) conditions. In addition to altering the E/I balance in both areas, ketamine had a negative impact on rule coding in true oscillatory activities. It also reduced frontoparietal coherence in a frequency- and rule-dependent manner. Granger prediction analysis revealed that ketamine induced an overall reduction in bidirectional connectivity. Among antisaccade trials, a greater reduction in lPFC&ndash;PPC connectivity during the delay period preceded a greater delay in saccadic onset under the RM condition and a greater deficit in performance under the RV condition. Lastly, ketamine compromised rule coding in lPFC neurons in both RV and RM conditions and in PPC neurons only in the RV condition. Our findings demonstrate the utility of acute NMDAR antagonists in understanding the mechanisms through which frontoparietal dynamics support cognitive control processes.</p>

                <p>Barn owls enable investigation of neural mechanisms underlying stimulus selection of concurrent stimuli. The audiovisual space map in the optic tectum (OT), avian homolog of the superior colliculus, encodes relative strength of concurrent auditory stimuli through spike response rate and interneuronal spike train synchrony (STS). Open questions remain regarding stimulus selection in downstream forebrain regions lacking topographic coding of auditory space, including the functional consequences of interneuronal STS on interregional signaling. To this end, we presented concurrent stimuli at different locations and manipulated relative strength while simultaneously recording neural responses from OT and its downstream thalamic target, nucleus rotundus (nRt), in awake barn owls of both sexes. Results demonstrated that broadly spatially tuned nRt units exhibit different spike response patterns to competition depending on spatial tuning preferences. Modeling suggests nRt units integrate convergent inputs from distant locations across midbrain map regions. Additionally, STS within nRt reflects the temporal properties of the strongest stimulus. Furthermore, interregional STS between OT and nRt was strongest when spatial tuning overlap between units across regions was large and when the strongest stimulus location during competition was favorable for units in both regions. Additionally, though gamma oscillations synthesized within OT are weakly propagated within nRt, average gamma power across regions correlates with strength of interregional STS. Overall, we demonstrate that nRt integrates inputs across distant areas of OT, retains spatial information through differences in strength of inputs from various locations of the midbrain map across neurons, and prioritizes coding of identity features to the strongest sound.</p>

                <p>Impairments in synaptic dynamics and stability are observed both in neurodegenerative disorders and in the healthy aging cortex, which exhibits elevated dendritic spine turnover and decreased long-term stability of excitatory connections at baseline, as well as an altered response to plasticity induction. In addition to the discrete gain and loss of synapses, spines also change in size and strength both during learning and in the absence of neural activity, and synaptic volume has been associated with stability and incorporation into memory traces. Furthermore, intrinsic dynamics, an apparently stochastic component of spine volume changes, may serve as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent stabilization of superfluous connections. However, the effects of age on modulation of synaptic weights remain unknown. Using two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy of spines during chemical plasticity induction in vitro and analyzing longitudinal in vivo 2PE images after a plasticity-inducing manipulation, we characterize the effects of age on volumetric changes of spines of the apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Aged mice exhibit decreased volumetric volatility and delayed rearrangement of synaptic weights of persistent connections, as well as greater susceptibility to spine shrinkage in response to chemical long-term depression. These results suggest a deficit in the aging brain&rsquo;s ability to fine-tune synaptic weights to properly incorporate and retain novel memories. This research provides the first evidence of alterations in spine volumetric dynamics in healthy aging and may support a model of impaired processing and learning in the aged somatosensory system.</p>

                <p>Hostility often co-occurs in parents and associates with increased aggression and inattention problems in children. In this population-based cohort of 484 mother&ndash;father&ndash;child neuroimaging trios, we investigated the degree to which associations of prenatal and childhood parental hostility would be associated with maternal, paternal, and child brain structural differences. Also, we examined whether hippocampal volumes of the parents or child mediate the association of prenatal parental hostility with child externalizing behaviors. Maternal and paternal hostility was assessed with the hostility subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory at three time points: prenatally at 30&nbsp;weeks&rsquo; gestation and when the child was 3 and 10&nbsp;years old. During adolescence assessment wave (age 14), maternal, paternal, and offspring assessment included a magnetic resonance imaging. Child externalizing problems were assessed with Youth Self-Report Child Behavior Checklist. Our findings suggest that maternal and paternal hostility were each associated with smaller gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes of their own and their partner's brain. Prenatal maternal but not paternal hostility was associated with smaller total gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes in the offspring. The child's hippocampal volumes partially mediated the associations of prenatal parental hostility (latent construct) with adolescent externalizing behavior, even after adjusting for prior child externalizing problems. Moreover, parental psychopathology may have long-lasting neurodevelopmental correlates in children that underlie the intergenerational transmission of behavioral problems. The behavior of family members results from a system of interdependent dyadic relationships over time that associate with specific brain structural differences.</p>
