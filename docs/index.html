	<p>Background: Although increased food cue reactivity is evidenced to be crucial to the development and maintenance of pediatric obesity, virtually nothing is known about the underlying neurophysiological aspects of food cue reactivity in children with obesity. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating neural characteristics in children with overweight or obesity using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Electrophysiological brain activity was measured using EEG frequency band analysis in n = 9 children with overweight or obesity versus n = 16 children with normal weight (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 years) during the presentation of high- and low-calorie food pictures and images of appealing non-food stimuli. Results: Children with overweight or obesity showed significantly increased relative central beta band activity induced by high-calorie foods and appealing non-food stimuli compared to children with normal weight. Beyond significant effects of the scalp region on EEG activity, non-significant effects of stimulus category or weight status were seen for theta and alpha frequency bands. Conclusions: This study demonstrated elevated beta band activity in children with overweight or obesity when viewing high-calorie food stimuli. Beta band activity may, thus, be a valuable target for neuromodulatory interventions in children with overweight or obesity.</p>

	<p>Background: Multimodal postoperative pain regimens are widely used following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, there are few studies on the rehabilitation of the co-application of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) for patients undergoing TKA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of LIA plus FNB and co-application of perioperative DEX on TKA outcomes. Methods: 95 patients were randomized into two groups. Patients in group B (n = 48) received a single preoperative FNB and LIA. Patients in group A (n = 47) received FNB and LIA, as well as continuous intravenous injection of DEX starting from the induction of anesthesia to postoperative day 2. All patients were allowed patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, knee range of motion (ROM) degrees, narcotic consumption, length of hospital stay (LOS), complications, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) Scores were recorded. Results: In group A, the mean VAS scores at rest and during movement were lower, the amount of rescue analgesia was decreased, first time of ambulation was reduced, ROM was improved, MoCA-B Scores were increased, LOS was shorter, HSS scores were higher postoperatively compared with group B (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our study indicated multimodal analgesia involving a single FNB and LIA combined with DEX accelerates rehabilitation for patients undergoing TKA.</p>

	<p>Proprioceptive deficits are common following stroke, yet the white matter involved in proprioception is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that multiple cortical regions are involved in proprioception, each connected by major white matter tracts, namely: Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (branches I, II and III), Arcuate Fasciculus and Middle Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF respectively). However, direct evidence on the involvement of these tracts in proprioception is lacking. Diffusion imaging was used to investigate the proprioceptive role of the SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF in 26 participants with stroke, and seven control participants without stroke. Proprioception was assessed using a robotic Arm Position Matching (APM) task, performed in a Kinarm Exoskeleton robotic device. Lesions impacting each tract resulted in worse APM task performance. Lower Fractional Anisotropy (FA) was also associated with poorer APM task performance for the SLF II, III, AF and MdLF. Finally, connectivity data surrounding the cortical regions connected by each tract accurately predicted APM task impairments post-stroke. This study highlights the importance of major cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical white matter tracts, particularly the SLF III and AF, for accurate proprioception after stroke. It advances our understanding of the white matter tracts responsible for proprioception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding the Time Course of Spatial Information from Spiking and Local Field Potential Activities in the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Place code representation is ubiquitous in circuits that encode spatial parameters. For visually guided eye movements, neurons in many brain regions emit spikes when a stimulus is presented in their receptive fields and/or when a movement is directed into their movement fields. Crucially, individual neurons respond for a broad range of directions or eccentricities away from the optimal vector, making it difficult to decode the stimulus location or the saccade vector from each cell&rsquo;s activity. We investigated whether it is possible to decode the spatial parameter with a population-level analysis, even when the optimal vectors are similar across neurons. Spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the superior colliculus (SC) were recorded with a laminar probe as monkeys performed a delayed saccade task to one of eight targets radially equidistant in direction. A classifier was applied offline to decode the spatial configuration as the trial progresses from sensation to action. For spiking activity, decoding performance across all eight directions was highest during the visual and motor epochs and lower but well above chance during the delay period. Classification performance followed a similar pattern for LFP activity too, except the performance during the delay period was limited mostly to the preferred direction. Increasing the number of neurons in the population consistently increased classifier performance for both modalities. Overall, this study demonstrates the power of population activity for decoding spatial information not possible from individual neurons.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Decision-making is an essential cognitive process by which we interact with the external world. However, attempts to understand the neural mechanisms of decision-making are limited by the current available animal models and the technologies that can be applied to them. Here, we build on the renewed interest in using tree shrews (<I>Tupaia belangeri</I>) in vision research and provide strong support for them as a model for studying visual perceptual decision-making. Tree shrews learned very quickly to perform a two-alternative forced choice contrast discrimination task, and they exhibited differences in response time distributions depending on the reward and punishment structure of the task. Specifically, they made occasional fast guesses when incorrect responses are punished by a constant increase in the interval between trials. This behavior was suppressed when faster incorrect responses were discouraged by longer intertrial intervals. By fitting the behavioral data with two variants of racing diffusion decision models, we found that the between-trial delay affected decision-making by modulating the drift rate of a time accumulator. Our results thus provide support for the existence of an internal process that is independent of the evidence accumulation in decision-making and lay a foundation for future mechanistic studies of perceptual decision-making using tree shrews.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-based learning in design and visual arts education: a bibliometric assessment of Scopus indexed literature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to critically review, quantify, and assess research outcomes on brain-based learning with an evidence-based study on Scopus indexed literature, with a focus to understand the evolution structure and growth, detect trends, subject development, and most importantly, identify the gaps in the published body of literature that relates brain-based learning to design and visual arts education. Methods: Various scientometric tools were used to map, visualize, and analyze 186 research publications, indexed in Scopus in a twenty-year timespan ‘2001-2021’. Annual publication trends, relevant sources, prolific authors, authorship patterns, productive organizations and countries, funding agencies, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and thematic evolution mapping on brain-based learning publications were examined in this study. Results: Despite the significance to apply brain-based learning strategies in design and visual arts education to boost students’ knowledge and creative skills, the findings show a decline in quantities and growth patterns in brain-based learning research directed towards design disciplines in the past twenty years. Among the identified (186) documents published in (128) sources, with (1013) citations, the study detected only (57) research (30%) that were related to ‘design education,’ including those focusing on ‘instructional design, ‘and ‘syllabus design’ whereas only (3) articles were in ‘design and visual arts’ disciplines. Conclusion: These rather small numbers reflect the big gap in the current body of literature that associates brain-based learning with creativity-based disciplines, specifically in design and visual arts education. This infers the necessity to direct the attention of academics, researchers, and educationalists in the fields of design and arts towards brain-based learning applications, research and pedagogy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measuring the motives of informal entrepreneurs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Handling non-observed activities pose major challenges to the governments and other stakeholders. Non-observed activities refer to underground activities, illegal activities, informal sector and any other activities that result in goods or services consumed by the household. The impact of these non-observed activities shows that the volume of people involved in the informal sector will rapidly increase. Informal economic activities are technically illegal yet are not intended as antisocial,   thereby remaining acceptable to many individuals within the society. This research aimed to identify the factors that lead to entrepreneurial necessity and opportunity.   Methods – The data of 51 respondents who were employed as informal entrepreneurs in Klang Valley areas in Malaysia was collected with the use of a questionnaire and convenient and proportionate sampling techniques. The data were analysed using SPSS software.   Results – The two primary drivers of informal entrepreneurial activity were necessity and opportunity. The inability to find a formal job was an example of being driven by necessity. Meanwhile, individuals that are driven by opportunity chose to work independently in these informal sectors. Between necessity and engagement, refinement acted as a mediator. Often, necessity and opportunity do not automatically translate into successful entrepreneurship; further refinement is required in terms of market potential, technology usage, location preferences, and capital requirements. Improved refinement results in increased entrepreneurial engagement.  Conclusions - The role and contribution of the informal sector entrepreneurship in economic development need to be evaluated and not just observed as an opportunity for individuals who choose this type of career. Therefore, further research is required in a wider variety of contexts to evaluate whether the same remains true in different populations. The results of this study can be useful for the government to set policies to encourage the transition of informal to formal entrepreneurships in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Plausible pathway for a host-parasite molecular replication network to increase its complexity through Darwinian evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rikuto Kamiura, Ryo Mizuuchi, Norikazu Ichihashi</p>

How the complexity of primitive self-replication molecules develops through Darwinian evolution remains a mystery with regards to the origin of life. Theoretical studies have proposed that coevolution with parasitic replicators increases network complexity by inducing inter-dependent replication. Particularly, Takeuchi and Hogeweg proposed a complexification process of replicator networks by successive appearance of a parasitic replicator followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasitic replicator. However, the feasibility of such complexification with biologically relevant molecules is still unknown owing to the lack of an experimental model. Here, we investigated the plausible complexification pathway of host-parasite replicators using both an experimental host-parasite RNA replication system and a theoretical model based on the experimental system. We first analyzed the parameter space that allows for sustainable replication in various replication networks ranging from a single molecule to three-member networks using computer simulation. The analysis shows that the most plausible complexification pathway from a single host replicator is the addition of a parasitic replicator, followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasite, consistent with the previous study by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. We also provide evidence that the pathway actually occurred in our previous evolutionary experiment. These results provide experimental evidence that a population of a single replicator spontaneously evolves into multi-replicator networks through coevolution with parasitic replicators.

                <p>by Matthias C. Rillig</p>

Lab teams are dynamic entities in which a lot depends on the principal investigator (PI) and the framework set by them. However, within these parameters, there is a lot of room for lab members to contribute to a happy and productive environment. Often doctoral students or postdocs (or other staff) may underestimate how much of a difference they can really make. Here are 10 simple rules on how to help make a lab a better place; these rules are mostly aimed at building better lab communities, where people help each other, look out for each other, and take an interest in critically questioning the status quo.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten quick tips for sequence-based prediction of protein properties using machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingzhen Hou, Katharina Waury, Dea Gogishvili, K. Anton Feenstra</p>

The ubiquitous availability of genome sequencing data explains the popularity of machine learning-based methods for the prediction of protein properties from their amino acid sequences. Over the years, while revising our own work, reading submitted manuscripts as well as published papers, we have noticed several recurring issues, which make some reported findings hard to understand and replicate. We suspect this may be due to biologists being unfamiliar with machine learning methodology, or conversely, machine learning experts may miss some of the knowledge needed to correctly apply their methods to proteins. Here, we aim to bridge this gap for developers of such methods. The most striking issues are linked to a lack of clarity: how were annotations of interest obtained; which benchmark metrics were used; how are positives and negatives defined. Others relate to a lack of rigor: If you sneak in structural information, your method is not sequence-based; if you compare your own model to “state-of-the-art,” take the best methods; if you want to conclude that some method is better than another, obtain a significance estimate to support this claim. These, and other issues, we will cover in detail. These points may have seemed obvious to the authors during writing; however, they are not always clear-cut to the readers. We also expect many of these tips to hold for other machine learning-based applications in biology. Therefore, many computational biologists who develop methods in this particular subject will benefit from a concise overview of what to avoid and what to do instead.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interneuronal network model of theta-nested fast oscillations predicts differential effects of heterogeneity, gap junctions and short term depression for hyperpolarizing versus shunting inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guillem Via, Roman Baravalle, Fernando R. Fernandez, John A. White, Carmen C. Canavier</p>

Theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Recently, it was shown that an intrinsic fast gamma mechanism in medial entorhinal cortex can be recruited by optogenetic stimulation at theta frequencies, which can persist with fast excitatory synaptic transmission blocked, suggesting a contribution of interneuronal network gamma (ING). We calibrated the passive and active properties of a 100-neuron model network to capture the range of passive properties and frequency/current relationships of experimentally recorded PV+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). The strength and probabilities of chemical and electrical synapses were also calibrated using paired recordings, as were the kinetics and short-term depression (STD) of the chemical synapses. Gap junctions that contribute a noticeable fraction of the input resistance were required for synchrony with hyperpolarizing inhibition; these networks exhibited theta-nested high frequency oscillations similar to the putative ING observed experimentally in the optogenetically-driven PV-ChR2 mice. With STD included in the model, the network desynchronized at frequencies above ~200 Hz, so for sufficiently strong drive, fast oscillations were only observed before the peak of the theta. Because hyperpolarizing synapses provide a synchronizing drive that contributes to robustness in the presence of heterogeneity, synchronization decreases as the hyperpolarizing inhibition becomes weaker. In contrast, networks with shunting inhibition required non-physiological levels of gap junctions to synchronize using conduction delays within the measured range.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Monitoring real-time transmission heterogeneity from incidence data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yunjun Zhang, Tom Britton, Xiaohua Zhou</p>

The transmission heterogeneity of an epidemic is associated with a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors. And it may indicate superspreading events to reduce the efficiency of population-level control measures and to sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in historic epidemics based on several data sources, such as contact history, viral genomes and spatial information, which may not be available, and more importantly ignore the temporal trend of transmission heterogeneity. Here we attempted to establish a convenient method to estimate real-time heterogeneity over an epidemic. Within the branching process framework, we introduced an instant-individualheterogenous infectiousness model to jointly characterize the variation in infectiousness both between individuals and among different times. With this model, we could simultaneously estimate the transmission heterogeneity and the reproduction number from incidence time series. We validated the model with data of both simulated and real outbreaks. Our estimates of the overall and real-time heterogeneities of the six epidemics were consistent with those presented in the literature. Additionally, our model is robust to the ubiquitous bias of under-reporting and misspecification of serial interval. By analyzing recent data from South Africa, we found evidence that the Omicron might be of more significant transmission heterogeneity than Delta. Our model based on incidence data was proved to be reliable in estimating the real-time transmission heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Inorganic sulfur fixation via a new homocysteine synthase allows yeast cells to cooperatively compensate for methionine auxotrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason S. L. Yu, Benjamin M. Heineike, Johannes Hartl, Simran K. Aulakh, Clara Correia-Melo, Andrea Lehmann, Oliver Lemke, Federica Agostini, Cory T. Lee, Vadim Demichev, Christoph B. Messner, Michael Mülleder, Markus Ralser</p>

The assimilation, incorporation, and metabolism of sulfur is a fundamental process across all domains of life, yet how cells deal with varying sulfur availability is not well understood. We studied an unresolved conundrum of sulfur fixation in yeast, in which organosulfur auxotrophy caused by deletion of the homocysteine synthase Met17p is overcome when cells are inoculated at high cell density. In combining the use of self-establishing metabolically cooperating (SeMeCo) communities with proteomic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we discovered an uncharacterized gene product YLL058Wp, herein named Hydrogen Sulfide Utilizing-1 (<i>HSU1</i>). Hsu1p acts as a homocysteine synthase and allows the cells to substitute for Met17p by reassimilating hydrosulfide ions leaked from <i>met17Δ</i> cells into O-acetyl-homoserine and forming homocysteine. Our results show that cells can cooperate to achieve sulfur fixation, indicating that the collective properties of microbial communities facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ERK1/2 signalling dynamics promote neural differentiation by regulating chromatin accessibility and the polycomb repressive complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claudia I. Semprich, Lindsay Davidson, Adriana Amorim Torres, Harshil Patel, James Briscoe, Vicki Metzis, Kate G. Storey</p>

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a neural inducer in many vertebrate embryos, but how it regulates chromatin organization to coordinate the activation of neural genes is unclear. Moreover, for differentiation to progress, FGF signalling must decline. Why these signalling dynamics are required has not been determined. Here, we show that dephosphorylation of the FGF effector kinase ERK1/2 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility at neural genes in mouse embryos, and, using ATAC-seq in human embryonic stem cell derived spinal cord precursors, we demonstrate that this occurs genome-wide across neural genes. Importantly, ERK1/2 inhibition induces precocious neural gene transcription, and this involves dissociation of the polycomb repressive complex from key gene loci. This takes place independently of subsequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and transcriptional onset. Transient ERK1/2 inhibition is sufficient for the dissociation of the repressive complex, and this is not reversed on resumption of ERK1/2 signalling. Moreover, genomic footprinting of sites identified by ATAC-seq together with ChIP-seq for polycomb protein Ring1B revealed that ERK1/2 inhibition promotes the occupancy of neural transcription factors (TFs) at non-polycomb as well as polycomb associated sites. Together, these findings indicate that ERK1/2 signalling decline promotes global changes in chromatin accessibility and TF binding at neural genes by directing polycomb and other regulators and appears to serve as a gating mechanism that provides directionality to the process of differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The importance of intermediate filaments in the shape maintenance of myoblast model tissues</a></h4>

              
                Liquid and elastic behaviors of tissues drives their morphology and their response to the environment. They appear as the first insight into tissue mechanics. We explore the role of individual cell properties on spheroids of mouse muscle precursor cells and investigate the role of intermediate filaments on surface tension and Young's modulus. By attening multicellular myoblast aggregates under magnetic constraint, we measure their rigidity and surface tension and show that they act as highly sensitive macroscopic reporters closely related to microscopic local tension and effective adhesion. Shedding light on the major contributions of acto-myosin contractility, actin organization and intercellular adhesions, we reveal the role of a major component of intermediate filaments in the muscle, desmin and its organization, on the macroscopic mechanics of these tissue models. Implicated in the mechanical and shape integrity of cells, intermediate filaments are found to be crucial to the mechanics of unorganized muscle tissue models even at an early stage of differentiation both in terms of elasticity and surface tension.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evaluation of in silico predictors on short nucleotide variants in HBA1, HBA2 and HBB associated with haemoglobinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Haemoglobinopathies are the commonest monogenic diseases worldwide and are caused by variants in the globin gene clusters. With over 2400 variants detected to date, their interpretation using the ACMG/AMP guidelines is challenging and computational evidence can provide valuable input about their functional annotation. While many <i>in silico</i> predictors have already been developed, their performance varies for different genes and diseases. In this study, we evaluate 31 <i>in silico</i> predictors using a dataset of 1627 variants in <i>HBA1</i>, <i>HBA2,</i> and <i>HBB</i>. By varying the decision threshold for each tool, we analyse their performance (a) as binary classifiers of pathogenicity, and (b) by using different non-overlapping pathogenic and benign thresholds for their optimal use in the ACMG/AMP framework. Our results show that CADD, Eigen-PC, and REVEL are the overall top performers, with the former reaching moderate strength level for pathogenic prediction. Eigen-PC and REVEL achieve the highest accuracies for missense variants, while CADD is also a reliable predictor of non-missense variants. Moreover, SpliceAI is the top performing splicing predictor, reaching strong level of evidence, while GERP++ and phyloP are the most accurate conservation tools. This study provides evidence about the optimal use of computational tools in globin gene clusters under the ACMG/AMP framework.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amino acid transporter SLC38A5 regulates developmental and pathological retinal angiogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Amino acid (AA) metabolism in vascular endothelium is important for sprouting angiogenesis. SLC38A5 (solute carrier family 38 member 5), an AA transporter, shuttles neutral AAs across cell membrane, including glutamine, which may serve as metabolic fuel for proliferating endothelial cells (ECs) to promote angiogenesis. Here, we found that <i>Slc38a5</i> is highly enriched in normal retinal vascular endothelium, and more specifically, in pathological sprouting neovessels. <i>Slc38a5</i> is suppressed in retinal blood vessels from <i>Lrp5<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Ndp<sup>y/−</sup></i> mice, both genetic models of defective retinal vascular development with Wnt signaling mutations. Additionally, <i>Slc38a5</i> transcription is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Genetic deficiency of <i>Slc38a5</i> in mice substantially delays retinal vascular development and suppresses pathological neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy modeling ischemic proliferative retinopathies. Inhibition of <i>SLC38A5</i> in human retinal vascular ECs impairs EC proliferation and angiogenic function, suppresses glutamine uptake, and dampens vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Together these findings suggest that SLC38A5 is a new metabolic regulator of retinal angiogenesis by controlling AA nutrient uptake and homeostasis in ECs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urotensin II-related peptides, Urp1 and Urp2, control zebrafish spine morphology</a></h4>

              
                The spine provides structure and support to the body, yet how it develops its characteristic morphology as the organism grows is little understood. This is underscored by the commonality of conditions in which the spine curves abnormally such as scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. Understanding the origin of such spinal curves has been challenging in part due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Recently, zebrafish have emerged as promising tools with which to understand the origin of spinal curves. Using zebrafish, we demonstrate that the Urotensin II-related peptides (URPs), Urp1 and Urp2, are essential for maintaining spine morphology. Urp1 and Urp2 are 10-amino acid cyclic peptides expressed by neurons lining the central canal of the spinal cord. Upon combined genetic loss of Urp1 and Urp2, adolescent-onset planar curves manifested in the caudal region of the spine. Highly similar curves were caused by mutation of Uts2r3, an URP receptor. Quantitative comparisons revealed that Urotensin-associated curves were distinct from other zebrafish spinal curve mutants in curve position and direction. Last, we found that the Reissner fiber, a proteinaceous thread that sits in the central canal and has been implicated in the control of spine morphology, breaks down prior to curve formation mutants with perturbed cilia motility but was unaffected by loss of Uts2r3. This suggests a Reissner fiber-independent mechanism of curvature in Urotensin-deficient mutants. Overall, our results show that Urp1 and Urp2 control zebrafish spine morphology and establish new animal models of spine deformity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human hippocampal responses to network intracranial stimulation vary with theta phase</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal-dependent memory is thought to be supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong input to the hippocampus benefitting encoding and weak input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles predicting minimal versus maximal input. We investigated whether this phase dependence exists in humans using network-targeted intracranial stimulation. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Lateral temporal stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late components. Using evoked component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether the phase of hippocampal theta predicted relatively high versus low connectivity. We observed an increase in the continuous phase-amplitude relationship selective to the early and late components of the response evoked by lateral temporal stimulation. The maximal difference in these evoked component amplitudes occurred across 180 degrees of separation in the hippocampal theta rhythm; i.e., the greatest difference in component amplitude was observed when stimulation was delivered at theta peak versus trough. The pattern of theta phase dependence observed for hippocampus was not identified for control locations. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal receptivity to input varies with theta phase, suggesting that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks. These findings confirm a putative mechanism by which neural oscillations modulate human hippocampal function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CD47 cross-dressing by extracellular vesicles expressing CD47 inhibits phagocytosis without transmitting cell death signals</a></h4>

              
                Transgenic CD47 overexpression is an encouraging approach to ameliorating xenograft rejection and alloresponses to pluripotent stem cells, and the efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRPα to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution and biological correlates of hand preferences in anthropoid primates</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of human right-handedness has been intensively debated for decades. Manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness, but restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies have so far limited comparative phylogenetic studies. By combining original data with published literature reports, we assembled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Based on that, we employ quantitative phylogenetic methods to test prevalent hypotheses on the roles of ecology, brain size, and tool use in primate handedness evolution. We confirm that human right-handedness represents an unparalleled extreme among anthropoids and found taxa displaying population-level handedness to be rare. Species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and did not strongly correlate with any of the selected biological predictors, nor with phylogeny. In contrast, we recovered highly variable patterns of hand preference strength, which show signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. In particular, terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution, including the postural origins hypothesis. Furthermore, they point to a potential adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates, a measure of hand preference that has often been overlooked in the past. Finally, our data show that human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.

                A growing body of research suggests that changes in both structural and functional connectivity in the ageing brain contribute to cognitive declines observed in later life. In recent years, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has garnered substantial research interest as a potential tool for the modulation of functional connectivity. Here, we report the findings from a double-blind crossover study that investigated the effects of dual-site beta tACS over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) on the response inhibition performance of healthy older (n =15, aged 61-79 years) and healthy younger (n = 18, aged 18-34 years) adults. Two tACS conditions were administered in separate sessions: in-phase tACS, where electrical currents delivered to rIFG and preSMA have a 0 degree phase difference, and anti-phase tACS, where the currents have a 180 degree phase difference. In-phase tACS was found to significantly improve response inhibition of only younger individuals, with better inhibitory performance associated with stronger rIFG-preSMA functional connectivity. Anti-phase tACS did not result in any significant changes in response inhibition or functional connectivity for either age group. It was posited that these findings were due to the disparity of tACS-induced field strengths in the stimulated regions, inter-individual variability in the tACS-induced effects on rIFG-preSMA connectivity, and age-related brain atrophy. The current study sheds light on the complex nature of responses to non-invasive brain stimulation, which potentially contributes to the development of novel neuromodulation-based therapeutic interventions for the maintenance of cognitive function in older adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational modeling reveals latent components of mouse behavior in the sucrose preference test</a></h4>

              
                The sucrose preference test (SPT) measures the relative preference of a sucrose solution over water to assess hedonic behaviors in rodents. The SPT involves numerous complex behaviors, including learning, motivation, and choice. Yet, it remains uncertain whether its main outcome measure, sucrose preference, can reflect these behavioral subcomponents. Here, we conducted an experimental and computational decomposition of mouse behavior in the SPT and discovered previously unrecognized behavioral subcomponents associated with changes in sucrose preference. While both acute and chronic stress reduced sucrose preference, only chronic stress evoked anhedonia. Additionally, reduced sucrose preference induced by optogenetics is not always indicative of anhedonia but can also reflect learning deficits. Even small variations in experimental conditions influence behavior, task outcome and interpretation. Thus, an ostensibly simple behavioral task can entail high levels of complexity, demonstrating the need for careful dissection of behavior into its subcomponents when studying the underlying neurobiology.

                In the search for biologically plausible but mathematically precise theories of learning in the brain, recent studies have begun to investigate how key assumptions underlying algorithms for supervised learning in artificial neural networks can be relaxed in biologically plausible ways. Turning to unsupervised learning, we develop biologically more plausible variants of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and benchmark their performance on MNIST. We show that RBMs with asymmetric connectivity can still be successfully trained with contrastive divergence, even if no two units are reciprocally connected. Furthermore, RBMs are able to learn if the forward, visible-to-hidden layer weights are kept constant and only the backward, hidden-to-visible layer weights are updated. These findings indicate that neural networks with biologically plausible connectivity support contrastive learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How gut hormones shape reward: a systematic review of the role of ghrelin and GLP-1 in human fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have opposite secretion patterns, as well as opposite effects on metabolism and food intake. Beyond their role in energy homeostasis, gastrointestinal hormones have also been suggested to modulate the reward system. However, the potential of ghrelin and GLP-1 to modulate reward responses in humans has not been systematically reviewed before. To evaluate the convergence of published results, we first conduct a multi-level kernel density meta-analysis of studies reporting a positive association of ghrelin (Ncomb = 353, 18 contrasts) and a negative association of GLP-1 (Ncomb = 258, 12 contrasts) and reward responses measured using task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Second, we complement the meta-analysis using a systematic literature review, focusing on distinct reward phases and applications in clinical populations that may account for variability across studies. In line with preclinical research, we find that ghrelin increases reward responses across studies in key nodes of the motivational circuit, such as the nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the dorsal mid insula. In contrast, for GLP-1, we did not find sufficient convergence in support of reduced reward responses. Instead, our systematic review identifies potential differences of GLP-1 on anticipatory versus consummatory reward responses. Based on a systematic synthesis of available findings, we conclude that there is considerable support for the neuromodulatory potential of gut-based circulating peptides on reward responses. To unlock their potential for clinical applications, future studies may move beyond anticipated rewards to cover other reward facets.

                Regulation of dopamine (DA) biosynthesis is critical for the functionalities of midbrain DA neurons. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine (DA) biosynthesis in midbrain DA neurons. Here we report that DA contents are decreased in the midbrain and striatum of DA neuron-specific JMJD3 conditional knockdown mice. Consistent results are obtained from mice underwent pharmaceutical JMJD3 inhibition. Biochemical and histological experiments reveal that TH mRNA and protein levels are specifically decreased in DA neurons residing in ventral tegmental area but not substantia nigra pars compacta. On behavioral level, JMJD3 knockdown affects inflammation-induced chronic mechanical hyperalgesia but not locomotor coordination, corresponding to DA-associated behavior in ventral tegmental area and in substantia nigra pars compacta, respectively. Mechanistically, using a midbrain DA neuron culture, we demonstrate that JMJD3 transactivates TH gene expression through direct binding onto TH promoter and catalyzing H3K27 de-methylation. In summary, our findings reveal a novel role of JMJD3 in adult midbrain DA system and suggest its functional specificity with DA subtype heterogeneity.

                Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity has been shown to be modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish the relationship between cortical network activity and arousal in spontaneously behaving head-fixed mice expressing the voltage sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. This approach allowed us to simultaneously image hemodynamic and voltage activity, and then compare fMRI analogous activity changes to the direct cortical voltage activity in relation to arousal and movement. Arousal and facial movements were assessed through analysis of face video recordings. We find that changes in pupil diameter were differentially coupled to hemodynamics and cortical voltage activity in a regionally and frequency specific way. Further this coupling changed between periods of spontaneous facial movements, and periods of rest. Our results indicate that while fMRI-like hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those shown by brain voltage activity.

                Presynaptic terminals are actively relocated during development to refine circuit function, but the underlying cell biological mechanisms are largely unknown. In C. elegans, the presynaptic boutons of GABAergic DD neurons are moved to new locations during early larval development. We show that developmentally regulated expression of a presynaptic Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC), UNC-8, promotes a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, resembling Activity-Dependent Bulk Endocytosis (ADBE), that dismantles presynaptic material for reassembly at nascent DD synapses. ADBE normally functions in highly active neurons to accelerate local recycling of synaptic vesicles. We show that DD presynaptic remodeling depends on canonical features of ADBE including elevated intracellular Ca2+, the phosphatase Calcineurin and its targets, dynamin and the F-BAR protein syndapin, and Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization. Thus, our findings suggest that a native mechanism (ADBE) for maintaining neurotransmitter release at local synapses has been repurposed, in this case, to dismantle presynaptic terminals for reassembly at new locations.

                Breathing is vital and must be concurrently robust and flexible. This rhythmic behavior is generated and maintained within a rostro-caudally aligned set of medullary nuclei called the Ventral Respiratory Column (VRC). The rhythmic properties of individual VRC nuclei are well known, yet technical challenges have limited the interrogation of the entire VRC population simultaneously. Here, we characterize over 13,000 VRC units using high-density electrophysiology, opto-tagging, and histological reconstruction. Population dynamics analysis reveals interactions between inspiratory and expiratory dynamical states give rise to a low-dimensional, elliptical neural manifold. The structure of this manifold is robust and maintained even during opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). However, during severe hypoxia-induced gasping, the low-dimensional dynamics of the VRC reconfigure from rotational to all-or-none, ballistic efforts.

                Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis currently being exacerbated by increased rates of use and overdose of synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers and treatment strategies to reduce problematic fentanyl use and relapse to fentanyl taking is critical. In recent years, there has been a growing body of work demonstrating that the gut microbiome can serve as a potent modulator of the behavioral and transcriptional responses to both stimulants and opioids. Here, we advance this work to define how manipulations of the microbiome drive fentanyl intake and fentanyl seeking in a translationally relevant drug self-administration model. Additionally, we utilize global proteomic analysis of the nucleus accumbens following microbiome manipulation and fentanyl administration to define how microbiome status alters the functional proteomic landscape in this key limbic substructure. These findings establish clear relevance for gut-brain signaling in OUD, and lay foundations for further translational work in this space.

                To understand how sensory events are represented in and perceived by the brain, one must understand how varying internal brain states affect neuronal decoding of sensory input. Recent studies indicate global state changes in the brain impact the representation of haptic events in neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). It could be argued that the manipulations used so far to alter the cortical circuitry behavior were artificial and not reflective of normal information processing in the neocortex. In the present study we therefore wanted to explore if natural visual stimulation also could impact the interpretation of given tactile input patterns. We recorded the unitary extracellular responses to a set of spatiotemporal tactile input patterns presented either alone or together with simultaneously multicolor flashing lights from a large number of neurons in parallel in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that the visual input, mildly but consistently altered the temporal spike outputs to tactile input patterns in S1 neurons. We argue that the visual input change the global cortical state to an extent that it affects the cortical representation of haptic events even within the S1 and that this is an indication that the cortical network in its information processing may be far more reliant on globally distributed network dynamics than traditionally thought.

                Some experiences are stronger than others: they have greater phenomenal magnitude. Although the phenomenal magnitude of experience is a familiar component of human consciousness, the computational scheme underpinning its encoding in the brain is unknown. In particular, it is unknown whether phenomenal magnitude is encoded in a "rich" manner, via the strengthening or broadcast of content-specific perceptual representations, or a "sparse" scheme, in which a content-invariant signal monitors the reliability or precision of first-order contents. In a reanalysis of existing MEG and fMRI data from two distinct studies, we operationalise phenomenal magnitude as subjective ratings of awareness and visibility to address this question. We find that phenomenal magnitude is associated with content-invariant neural signatures distributed across visual, parietal, and frontal cortices. Moreover, we show that these neural signatures exhibit similarities with other analogue magnitude codes such as number, with each rating being represented as being more similar to its neighbours, and less similar to more distant ratings. Our findings suggest a role for a content-invariant analogue magnitude code in determining the strength of perceptual experience.

                Body postures provide information about others' actions, intentions, and emotional states. However, little is known about how postures are represented in the brain's visual system. Considering our extensive visuomotor experience with body postures, we hypothesized that priors derived from this experience may systematically bias visual body posture representations. We examined two priors: gravity and biomechanical constraints. Gravity pushes lifted body parts downwards, while biomechanical constraints limit the range of possible postures (e.g., an arm raised far behind the head cannot go down further). We probed participants' (N = 246) memory of briefly presented postures using change discrimination and adjustment tasks. Results showed that lifted arms were misremembered as lower and as more similar to biomechanically plausible postures. Inverting the body stimuli eliminated both biases, implicating holistic body processing. Together, these findings show that knowledge shapes body posture representations, reflecting modulation from a combination of category-general and category-specific priors.

                Abnormalities in temporal and frontal lobes (TL and FL) have been linked to cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. While structural and functional differences between the brain lobes have been documented in disease, the cellular heterogeneity in FL and TL and its impact to the vulnerability to genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders is not well studied. We hypothesize that intrinsic cellular-level differences between TL and FL explain the vulnerability of specific cell types to genetic risk factors and psychoactive drugs. To test this, we integrated single-nucleus transcriptome analysis in fresh human FL and TL with data related to genetic susceptibility and gene dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disease, and response to psychoactive drugs. We also investigate how these differences are associated with gene dysregulation in disease brain. Neuronal cell populations were the most vulnerable to psychiatric genetic risk factors, and more specifically parvalbumin interneurons (PVALB neurons). These PVALB-expressed genetic risk factors were mostly upregulated in the TL compared with FL, and dysregulated in the brain of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We found GRIN2A and HCN1, implicated in schizophrenia by genome-wide association studies, to be significantly upregulated in PVLAB from the TL and in brain cortex from schizophrenia patients. Our analysis provides comprehensive evidence for PVALB neurons as the most vulnerable cell type that is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. PVALB neurons showed the highest vulnerability to psychoactive drug response, which was 3.6-fold higher than the vulnerability to genetic risk factors. In summary, we show high vulnerability of PVALB neurons that is specific to the temporal lobe, implying that differences between TL and FL greatly influence the cell vulnerability to genetic risk factors as well as the response to psychoactive drugs. These findings offer insights into how regional brain differences affect the cell type vulnerabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Prion-like transmission of pathology in alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinsons disease or multiple system atrophy is increasingly recognized as one potential mechanism to address disease progression. Active and passive immunotherapies targeting insoluble, aggregated alpha-synuclein are already being actively explored in the clinic with mixed outcomes so far. Here, we report the identification of 306C7B3, a highly selective, aggregate-specific alpha-synuclein antibody with picomolar affinity devoid of binding to the monomeric, physiologic protein. 306C7B3 binding is Ser129-phosphorylation independent and shows high affinity to several different aggregated alpha-synuclein polymorphs, increasing the likelihood that it can also bind to the pathological seeds assumed to drive disease progression in patients. In support of this, highly selective binding to pathological aggregates in postmortem brains of MSA patients was demonstrated, with no staining in samples from other human neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve CNS exposure of 306C7B3, an Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) based approach driving expression of the secreted antibody within the brain of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-alpha-Synuclein mice was used. Widespread central transduction after intrastriatal inoculation was ensured by using the AAV2HBKO serotype, with transduction being spread to areas far away from the inoculation site. Treatment of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-alpha-Synuclein mice at the age of 12 months demonstrated significantly increased survival, with 306C7B3 concentration reaching 3.9 nM in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results suggest that AAV-mediated expression of 306C7B3 has great potential as a disease-modifying therapy for alpha-synucleinopathies as it ensures CNS exposure of the antibody, thereby mitigating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are required for potentiation and depression of responses in ocular dominance plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed to synaptic scaling. However, homeostasis during other forms of visual deprivation is caused by sliding the threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2-6d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results indicate that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure, and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.

                World-wide, nearly 40% of the adult population is classified as clinically obese. Central inflammation is highly correlated with obesity and increases morbidity and deterioration of health. The hypothalamus is a brain region that governs many facets of energy homeostasis, and melanocortins in the hypothalamus both decrease feeding and increase metabolism via melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs). Although MC4Rs are present on neurons and astrocytes (aMC4R) previous work has focused almost exclusively on the neuronal population with the contribution of aMC4R on these processes largely unknown. Our objective was to determine the effects of hypothalamic aMC4R deletion on central and peripheral inflammation, as well as feeding and body weight homeostasis. Adult MC4R fl/fl mice were microinjected with an astrocyte-specific promoter driving Cre-expression (AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre) or AAV-control (AAV-GFAP-GFP; n=4-7/group/sex) to produce a hypothalamic knock-down of aMC4R (KD). Body weight and composition were monitored throughout the study, and indirect calorimetry was conducted at 1 and 4 weeks after AAV injection. Acquisition of operant self-administration of palatable food was also examined. Mice were euthanized 7-8 weeks post AAV injection and brain and tissue samples were collected. We observed a significant increase in body weight, feeding, and energy balance in the KD group compared to control group. Inflammation was significantly increased centrally in KD mice within the hypothalamus, but not peripherally within serum. Additionally, aMC4R KD mice trended towards an increased reward learning for palatable food. This is the first demonstration that hypothalamic aMC4R, independent of neuronal MC4R, is important in modulating inflammation as well as contributing to energy balance. These results provide an integral understanding of the aMC4R system that will provide the foundation for future studies investigating the role of aMC4R in various disease states.

                Mechanisms that augment dopamine (DA) signaling to compensate for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss and delay motor impairment in Parkinsons disease remain unidentified. The rat nigrostriatal pathway was unilaterally-lesioned by 6-OHDA to determine whether differences in DA content, TH protein, TH phosphorylation, or D1 receptor expression in striatum or substantia nigra (SN) aligned with onset of hypokinesia at two time points. At 7 days, DA and TH loss in striatum exceeded 95%, whereas DA was unaffected in SN, despite 60% TH loss. At 28 days, hypokinesia was established. At both time points, ser31 TH phosphorylation increased only in SN, corresponding to less DA versus TH loss. ser40 TH phosphorylation was unaffected in striatum or SN. By day 28, D1 receptor expression increased only in lesioned SN. These results indicate that increased ser31 TH phosphorylation and D1 receptor in the SN, not striatum, augment DA signaling against TH loss to mitigate hypokinesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orthogonal neural encoding of targets and distractors supports multivariate cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                People can overcome a wide array of mental challenges by coordinating their neural information processing to align with their goals. Recent behavioral work has shown that people can independently control their attention across multiple features during perceptual decision-making, but the structure of the neural representations that enables this multivariate control remains mysterious. We hypothesized that the brain solves this complex coordination problem by orthogonalizing feature-specific representations of task demands and attentional priority, allowing the brain to independently monitor and adjust multiple streams of stimulus information. To test this hypothesis, we measured fMRI activity while participants performed a task designed to tag processing and control over feature-specific information that is task-relevant (targets) versus task-irrelevant (distractors). We then characterized the geometry of these neural representations using a novel multivariate analysis (Encoding Geometry Analysis), estimating where the encoding of different task features is correlated versus orthogonal. We identified feature-specific representations of task demands and attentional priority in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), respectively, consistent with differential roles for these regions in monitoring versus directing information processing. Representations of attentional priority in IPS were fully mediated by the control requirements of the task, associated with behavioral performance, and depended on connectivity with nodes in the frontoparietal control network, suggesting that these representations serve a fundamental role in supporting attentional control. Together, these findings provide evidence for a neural geometry that can enable coordinated control over multiple sources of information.

                Assessing the consistency of quantitative MRI measurements is critical for inclusion in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Intraclass coefficient correlation and coefficient of variation were used to evaluate the different consistency aspects of diffusion- and myelin-based MRI measures. Multi-shell diffusion and inhomogeneous magnetization transfer datasets were collected from twenty healthy adults at a high-frequency of five MRI sessions. The consistency was evaluated across whole bundles and the track-profile along the bundles. The impact of the fiber populations on the consistency was also evaluated using the number of fiber orientations map. For whole and profile bundles, moderate to high reliability of diffusion and myelin measures were observed. We report higher reliability of measures for multiple fiber populations than single. The overall portrait of the most consistent measurements and bundles drawn from a wide range of MRI techniques presented here will be particularly useful for identifying reliable biomarkers capable of detecting, monitoring and predicting white matter changes in clinical applications and has the potential to inform patient-specific treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Filter-based models of suppression in retinal ganglion cells: comparison and generalization across species and stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of the neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron's spiking responses and shapes, for example, the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models in predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depended on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and emphasize different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel expressed in primary sensory neurons and other tissues, including prostate and urothelium. Its participation in different physiological and pathological processes such as thermoregulation, pain, itch, inflammation and cancer has been widely de-scribed, making it a promising target for therapeutic approaches. The detection and quantification of TRPM8 seems crucial for advancing in the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its role in these pathophysiological conditions. Antibody-based techniques are commonly used for protein detection and quantification, although their performance with many ion channels, including TRPM8, is suboptimal. Thus, the search for reliable antibodies is of utmost importance. In this study, we characterized the performance of six TRPM8 commercial antibodies in three immuno-detection techniques: western blot, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Different outcomes were obtained for the tested antibodies; two of them proved to be successful detecting TRPM8 in the three approaches while, in the conditions tested, the other four were acceptable only for specific techniques. Considering our results, we offer some insight into the usefulness of these antibodies for detection of TRMP8 depending on the methodology of choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered lipid homeostasis underlies selective neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulated lipid homeostasis is emerging as a potential cause of neurodegenerative disorders. However, evidence of errors in lipid homeostasis as a pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration remains limited. Here, we show that the cerebellar neurodegeneration caused by SNX14 deficiency is associated with lipid metabolism defects. Recent in vitro and in silico studies indicate that SNX14 is an inter-organelle lipid transfer protein that regulates lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid desaturation, suggesting that human SNX14 deficiency belongs to an expanding class of cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders caused by altered cellular lipid homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse model that recapitulates the human SNX14 deficiency at genetic and phenotypic level. Through histological and transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cells are selectively vulnerable to SNX14 deficiency, while forebrain regions preserve their neuronal content. Ultrastructure and lipidomic studies reveal widespread lipid storage and metabolism defects in SNX14 deficient mice. Furthermore, we identify a unique lipid metabolite profile that links the accumulation of acylcarnitines with the selective cerebellar neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency. These findings highlight the importance of lipid homeostasis for neuronal function and survival and suggest a mechanism for selective cerebellar vulnerability to altered lipid homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Moving and static faces, bodies, objects and scenes are differentially represented across the three visual pathways</a></h4>

              
                Models of human cortex propose the existence of neuroanatomical pathways specialised for different behavioural functions. These pathways include a ventral pathway for object recognition, a dorsal pathway for performing visually guided physical actions and a recently proposed third pathway for social perception. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that different categories of moving stimuli are differentially processed across the dorsal and third pathways according to their behavioural implications. Human participants (N=30) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing moving and static stimuli from five categories (faces, bodies, scenes, objects, and scrambled objects). Whole brain group analyses showed that moving bodies and moving objects increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), parts of the dorsal pathway. In addition, moving faces and moving bodies increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS), parts of the third pathway. This pattern of results was also supported by a separate region of interest (ROI) analysis showing that moving stimuli produced more robust neural responses for all visual object categories, particularly in lateral and dorsal brain areas. Our results suggest that dynamic naturalistic stimuli from different categories are routed along specific visual pathways that process their unique behavioural implications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanisms of parasite-induced summiting behavior in 'zombie' Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                For at least two centuries, scientists have been enthralled by the zombie behaviors induced by mind-controlling parasites. Despite this interest, the mechanistic bases of these uncanny processes have remained mostly a mystery. Here, we leverage the recently established Entomophthora muscae-Drosophila melanogaster zombie fly system to reveal the molecular and cellular underpinnings of summit disease, a manipulated behavior evoked by many fungal parasites. Using a new, high-throughput behavior assay to measure summiting, we discovered that summiting behavior is characterized by a burst of locomotion and requires the host circadian and neurosecretory systems, specifically DN1p circadian neurons, pars intercerebralis to corpora allata projecting (PI-CA) neurons and corpora allata (CA), who are solely responsible for juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and release. Summiting is a fleeting phenomenon, posing a challenge for physiological and biochemical experiments requiring tissue from summiting flies. We addressed this with a machine learning classifier to identify summiting animals in real time. PI-CA neurons and CA appear to be intact in summiting animals, despite E. muscae cells invading the host brain, particularly in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), the neuropil that contains DN1p axons and PI-CA dendrites. The blood-brain barrier of flies late in their infection was significantly permeabilized, suggesting that factors in the hemolymph may have greater access to the central nervous system during summiting. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from summiting flies revealed differential abundance of several compounds compared to non-summiting flies. Transfusing the hemolymph of summiting flies into non-summiting recipients induced a burst of locomotion, demonstrating that factor(s) in the hemolymph likely cause summiting behavior. Altogether, our work reveals a neuro-mechanistic model for summiting wherein fungal cells perturb fly hemolymph, activating the neurohormonal pathway linking clock neurons to juvenile hormone production in the CA, ultimately inducing locomotor activity in their host.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The evolution of whole-brain turbulent dynamics during recovery from traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Significant advances in non-linear dynamics and computational modeling have opened up the possibility of studying how whole-brain dynamics may be impacted by brain injury. Importantly, by looking at the local level of synchronization, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal patterns affected at different spatial scales. In the current study, we applied the turbulent dynamics framework to investigate the temporal evolution in whole-brain dynamics using an open access resting state fMRI dataset from a cohort of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and healthy controls (HC). We first examined how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between HCs and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury. We found a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI, with the largest change at 6-months post-injury. Next, we built a Hopf whole-brain model with coupled oscillators and conducted in silico perturbations to investigate the mechanistic principles underlying the reduced turbulent dynamics found in the empirical data. This revealed a shift to lower coupling parameters in the TBI dataset and, critically, decreased susceptibility and information encoding capability. These findings confirm the potential of the turbulent framework to characterize whole-brain dynamics after TBI and suggest a mechanistic link between structural disconnection and impaired information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-directed modulation of stretch reflex gains is reduced in the non-dominant upper limb</a></h4>

              
                Most individuals experience their dominant arm as being more dexterous than the non-dominant arm, but the neural mechanisms underlying this asymmetry in motor behaviour are unclear. Using a delayed reach task, it has recently been demonstrated that there is a strong goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains in the dominant upper limb of human participants. Here, we used an equivalent experimental paradigm to address the neural mechanisms that underlie the preparation for reaching movements with the non-dominant upper limb. We found only minor goal-directed differences in the short latency stretch reflex of the non-dominant limb. There were consistent effects of load, preparatory delay duration and target direction on the long latency stretch reflex. However, by comparing stretch reflex responses in the non-dominant arm with those previously documented in the dominant arm, we demonstrate that goal-directed tuning of short and long latency stretch reflexes is markedly weaker in the non-dominant limb. The results indicate that the motor performance asymmetries across the two upper limbs is partly due to the more sophisticated control of reflexive stiffness in the dominant limb, likely facilitated by the superior goal-directed control of muscle spindle receptors. Our findings therefore suggest that independent fusimotor control plays a role in determining performance of complex motor behaviours and support existing proposals that the dominant arm is better supplied for executing more complex tasks, such as trajectory control.

                The Human 1.2-Mb AUTS2 locus on chromosome 7q11.22 encodes a 1259-aa full-length protein, and a 711-aa C-terminal isoform. Functions of these AUTS2 proteins are only partly known. The major traits found in patients displaying AUTS2 locus mutations are Intellectual Disabilities, microcephaly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (54%), and autistic traits. Furthermore, AUTS2 common variants were recently found associated to alcohol consumption and dyslexia using GWAS approaches. Auts2 localizes mainly in cell nuclei. We evidenced by super-resolution that Auts2 is present in dendritic spines. Auts2 interacts with Ttc3, the Akt2 E3 ligase, and negatively regulates Akt2 ubiquitination. Auts2 haploinsufficiency affects Akt/mTorc1 pathway with a decrease in AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and in synaptic currents. Akt2 injection in postsynaptic neurons is sufficient to reverse changes in synaptic currents generated by Auts2 haploinsufficiency. Using chromosome engineering based on targeted meiotic recombination, we generated two mouse models with Auts2 locus deletion and duplication. Deleted Auts2 locus mice display stereotypies (rearing), perseveration and abnormal recognition memory. Duplicated Auts2 locus mice display similar perseveration and abnormal recognition memory but also a decrease in cued and contextual fear memory. Gene dosage induce changes in brain sub-region neuronal networks. In the thalamo-lateral amygdala pathway linked to cued fear memory, we found synaptic impairments linked to AMPA receptors, with a specific decrease in pAKT/total AKT ratio in duplicated Auts2 mice. Altogether, our study thereby provides a novel mechanistic and potentially therapeutic understanding of synaptic AKT/mTORC1 deregulated signaling and its related behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.

                The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been extensively studied in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a novel selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of transitions of the horizon across a retinal region. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour-opponency in transient Suppressed-by-Contrast RGCs (tSbC), a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts, which we found to be characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head- or eye-movements across the horizon. Because tSbCs reliably detected these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.

                Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) modulates social behaviors in a species-specific manner. Remarkable inter- and intraspecies variation in brain OXTR distribution are associated with diversity in social behavior. To investigate potential genetic mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic plasticity in brain Oxtr expression and its consequences on social behavior, we constructed BAC transgenic mice harboring the entire prairie vole Oxtr locus with surrounding intergenic regulatory elements. Eight independent volized (pvOxtr) mouse lines were obtained; remarkably, each line displayed a unique pattern of brain expression distinct from mice and prairie voles. Four pvOxtr lines were selected for further investigation. Despite robust differences in brain expression, Oxtr expression in mammary gland was conserved across lines, suggesting that Oxtr expression in brain, but not mammary gland, is highly sensitive to local chromosomal landscape at integration sites. Moreover, different volized mouse lines showed differences in partner preference and maternal behaviors. Our results from this cross-species study suggest that species-specific variation in regulatory elements or distribution of transcription factors are not responsible for species-typical brain Oxtr expression patterns. Thus, transcriptional hypersensitivity to surrounding sequence of brain Oxtr may be a key mechanism to generate diversity in brain OXTR distribution and social behaviors. This inherent evolvability of brain Oxtr expression constitutes a novel transcriptional mechanism to generate variability in neuropeptide receptor distribution which, through natural selection, can generate diversity in adaptive social behaviors while preserving peripheral expression. The volized Oxtr mouse lines are useful for further understanding OXTR regulation and key neural circuits/networks mediating variability in social behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A small-correlation expansion to quantify information in noisy sensory systems</a></h4>

              
                Neural networks encode information through their collective spiking activity in response to external stimuli. This population response is noisy and strongly correlated, with complex interplay between correlations induced by the stimulus, and correlations caused by shared noise. Understanding how these correlations affect information transmission has so far been limited to pairs or small groups of neurons, because the curse of dimensionality impedes the evaluation of mutual information in larger populations. Here we develop a small-correlation expansion to compute the stimulus information carried by a large population of neurons, yielding interpretable analytical expressions in terms of the neurons' firing rates and pairwise correlations. We validate the approximation on synthetic data and demonstrate its applicability to electrophysiological recordings in the vertebrate retina, allowing us to quantify the effects of noise correlations between neurons and of memory in single neurons.

	<p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have attracted much attention in the task of electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition. However, most features of current GCNs do not take full advantage of the causal connection between the EEG signals in different frequency bands during the process of constructing the adjacency matrix. Based on the causal connectivity between the EEG channels obtained by Granger causality (GC) analysis, this paper proposes a multi-frequency band EEG graph feature extraction and fusion method for EEG emotion recognition. First, the original GC matrices between the EEG signals at each frequency band are calculated via GC analysis, and then they are adaptively converted to asymmetric binary GC matrices through an optimal threshold. Then, a kind of novel GC-based GCN feature (GC-GCN) is constructed by using differential entropy features and the binary GC matrices as the node values and adjacency matrices, respectively. Finally, on the basis of the GC-GCN features, a new multi-frequency band feature fusion method (GC-F-GCN) is proposed, which integrates the graph information of the EEG signals at different frequency bands for the same node. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GC-F-GCN method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art GCN methods, for which average accuracies of 97.91%, 98.46%, and 98.15% were achieved for the arousal, valence, and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;valence classifications, respectively.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Obesity is thought to arise, in part, from deficits in the inhibitory control over appetitive behavior. Such motivational processes are regulated by neuromodulators, specifically acetylcholine (ACh), via &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR). These nAChR are highly enriched in the thalamus and contribute to the thalamic gating of cortico-striatal signaling, but also act on the mesoaccumbal reward system. The changes in &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability, however, have not been demonstrated in human obesity thus far. The aim of our study was, thus, to investigate whether there is altered brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in individuals with obesity compared to normal-weight healthy controls. Methods: We studied 15 non-smoking individuals with obesity (body mass index, BMI: 37.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.1 kg/m2; age: 39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 years, 9 females) and 16 normal-weight controls (non-smokers, BMI: 21.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 kg/m2; age: 28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7 years, 13 females) by using PET and the &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR selective (&amp;amp;minus;)-[18F]flubatine, which was applied within a bolus-infusion protocol (294 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16 MBq). Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was performed in order to calculate the regional total distribution volume (VT). Results: No overall significant difference in VT between the individuals with obesity and the normal-weight volunteers was found, while the VT in the nucleus basalis of Meynert tended to be lower in the individuals with obesity (10.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 versus 11.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.2; p = 0.10), and the VT in the thalamus showed a tendency towards higher values in the individuals with obesity (26.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 versus 25.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.2; p = 0.09). Conclusion: While these first data do not show greater brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in human obesity overall, the findings of potentially aberrant &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in the key brain regions that regulate feeding behavior merit further exploration.</p>

	<p>The body of mammals harbors two distinct types of adipose tissue: while cells within the white adipose tissue (WAT) store surplus energy as lipids, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is nowadays recognized as the main tissue for transforming chemical energy into heat. This process, referred to as &amp;amp;lsquo;non-shivering thermogenesis&amp;amp;rsquo;, is facilitated by the uncoupling of the electron transport across mitochondrial membranes from ATP production. BAT-dependent thermogenesis acts as a safeguarding mechanism under reduced ambient temperature but also plays a critical role in metabolic and energy homeostasis in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the evolutionary structure, function and regulation of the BAT organ under neuronal and hormonal control and discuss its mutual interaction with the central nervous system. We conclude by conceptualizing how better understanding the multifaceted communicative links between the brain and BAT opens avenues for novel therapeutic approaches to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To determine the short- and medium-term therapeutic effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and to study the optimal position of activated contacts for RLS symptoms. Methods: We preoperatively and postoperatively assessed PD Patients with RLS undergoing STN-DBS. Additionally, we recorded the stimulation parameters that induced RLS or relieved RLS symptoms during a follow-up. Finally, we reconstructed the activated contacts&amp;amp;rsquo; position that reduced or induced RLS symptoms. Results: 363 PD patients were enrolled. At the 1-year follow-up, we found that the IRLS sum significantly decreased in the RLS group (preoperative 18.758 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.706, postoperative 8.121 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.083, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the CGI score, MOS sleep, and RLS QLQ all showed that the STN-DBS improved RLS symptoms after one year. Furthermore, the activated contacts that relieved RLS were mainly located in the central sensorimotor region of the STN. Activated contacts in the inferior sensorimotor part of the STN or in the substantia nigra might have induced RLS symptoms. Conclusions: STN-DBS improved RLS in patients with PD in one year, which reduced their sleep disorders and increased their quality of life. Furthermore, the central sensorimotor region part of the STN is the optimal stimulation site.</p>

	<p>Stereotype threat arises when the activation of negative stereotypes about a group impairs performance of stigmatized individuals on stereotype relevant tasks. There is ample evidence that stereotype threat leads to performance detriments by consuming executive resources. Several studies indeed showed that working memory (WM) mediates stereotype threat effects among young adults. More recently, researchers have sought to understand whether the same mechanisms underlie age-based stereotype threat, but findings are mixed regarding the role of WM and some authors rather favor a motivational explanation based on regulatory fit. The present review critically appraises the empirical support for distinct forms of stereotype threat effects mediated by distinct mechanisms. We propose a novel approach based on one of the most recent WM models, the time-based resource sharing model, to evaluate the impact of stereotype threat on attentional resources in WM among both young and older adults.</p>

	<p>This article provides an overview of verbal lie detection research. This type of research began in the 1970s with examining the relationship between deception and specific words. We briefly review this initial research. In the late 1980s, Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) emerged, a veracity assessment tool containing a list of verbal criteria. This was followed by Reality Monitoring (RM) and Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), two other veracity assessment tools that contain lists of verbal criteria. We discuss their contents, theoretical rationales, and ability to identify truths and lies. We also discuss similarities and differences between CBCA, RM, and SCAN. In the mid 2000s, &amp;amp;lsquo;Interviewing to deception&amp;amp;rsquo; emerged, with the goal of developing specific interview protocols aimed at enhancing or eliciting verbal veracity cues. We outline the four most widely researched interview protocols to date: the Strategic Use of Evidence (SUE), Verifiability Approach (VA), Cognitive Credibility Assessment (CCA), and Reality Interviewing (RI). We briefly discuss the working of these protocols, their theoretical rationales and empirical support, as well as the similarities and differences between them. We conclude this article with elaborating on how neuroscientists can inform and improve verbal lie detection.</p>

	<p>An obvious reason for substance uses disorders (SUDs) is drug craving and seeking behavior induced by conditioned context, which is an abnormal solid context memory. The relationship between susceptibility to SUD and learning ability remains unclear in humans and animal models. In this study, we found that susceptibility to morphine use disorder (MUD) was negatively correlated with learning ability in conditioned place preference (CPP) in C57 mice. By using behavioral tests, we identified the FVB mouse as learning impaired. In addition, we discovered that learning-relevant proteins, such as the glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, NR1, and NR2A, were decreased in FVB mice. Finally, we assessed the context learning ability of FVB mice using the CPP test and priming. We found that FVB mice had lower learning performance with respect to normal memory but higher performance of morphine-reinstatement memory. Compared to C57 mice, FVB mice are highly sensitive to MUDs. Our results suggest that SUD susceptibility is predicted by impaired learning ability in mice; therefore, learning ability can play a simple and practical role in identifying high-risk SUD groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Networks Implicated in Autobiographical Memory Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive function. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain areas have been previously linked to autobiographical recollection, including structures in the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in connectivity within different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 human subjects. We found that memory training using olfactory cues increases resting-state intranetwork DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, preliminary data indicate that only the decrease in sensorimotor connectivity associated with the training-induced decrease in the tumor necrosis factor &alpha; (TNF&alpha;) factor, an immune modulation previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory with both high-level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Discounting of Future Rewards and Punishments in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal reward discounting describes the decrease of value of a reward as a function of delay. Decision-making between future aversive outcomes is much less studied, and there is no clear decision pattern across studies; while some authors suggest that human and nonhuman animals prefer sooner over later painful shocks, others found the exact opposite. In a series of three experiments, Long&ndash;Evans rats chose between differently timed electric shocks and rewards in a T-maze. In experiment 1, rats chose between early and late painful shocks with identical, long reward delays; in experiment 2, they chose between early reward and early shocks, or late rewards and late shocks; in experiment 3, they chose between early and late rewards, with identical, short delays to the shock. We tested the predictions of two competing hypotheses: the aversive discounting theory assumes that future shocks are discounted, and, hence, less unpleasant than early shocks. The utility from anticipation theory implies that rats derive negative utility from waiting for the shock; late shocks should, hence, be more unpleasant than early shocks. We did not find unanimous evidence for either theory. Instead, our results are more consistent with the <I>post hoc</I> idea that shocks may have negative spill-over effects on reward values, the closer in time a shock is to a subsequent reward, the stronger the reward is devalued. Interestingly and consistent with our theory, we find that, depending on the temporal shock-reward contiguity, rats can be brought to prefer later over sooner rewards of identical magnitudes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC2 in Primary Sensory Neurons Constitutively Restrains Chronic Pain by Repressing {alpha}2{delta}-1 Expression and Associated NMDA Receptor Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;2-1 (encoded by the <I>Cacna2d1</I> gene) is a newly discovered NMDA receptor-interacting protein and is the therapeutic target of gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin) frequently used for treating patients with neuropathic pain. Nerve injury causes sustained &alpha;2-1 upregulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which promotes NMDA receptor synaptic trafficking and activation in the spinal dorsal horn, a hallmark of chronic neuropathic pain. However, little is known about how nerve injury initiates and maintains the high expression level of &alpha;2-1 to sustain chronic pain. Here, we show that nerve injury caused histone hyperacetylation and diminished enrichment of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), but not HDAC3, at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in the DRG. Strikingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown or conditional knockout in DRG neurons in male and female mice consistently induced long-lasting mechanical pain hypersensitivity, which was readily reversed by blocking NMDA receptors, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDA receptor interaction at the spinal cord level. <I>Hdac2</I> deletion in DRG neurons increased histone acetylation levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter, upregulated &alpha;2-1 in the DRG, and potentiated &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent NMDA receptor activity at primary afferent central terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correspondingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown-induced pain hypersensitivity was blunted in <I>Cacna2d1</I> knockout mice. Thus, our findings reveal that HDAC2 functions as a pivotal transcriptional repressor of neuropathic pain via constitutively suppressing &alpha;2-1 expression and ensuing presynaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord. HDAC2 enrichment levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in DRG neurons constitute a unique epigenetic mechanism that governs acute-to-chronic pain transition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excess &alpha;2-1 proteins produced after nerve injury directly interact with glutamate NMDA receptors to potentiate synaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord, a prominent mechanism of nerve pain. Because &alpha;2-1 upregulation after nerve injury is long lasting, gabapentinoids relieve pain symptoms only temporarily. Our study demonstrates for the first time the unexpected role of intrinsic HDAC2 activity at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in limiting &alpha;2-1 gene transcription, NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and chronic pain development after nerve injury. These findings challenge the prevailing view about the role of general HDAC activity in promoting chronic pain. Restoring the repressive HDAC2 function and/or reducing histone acetylation at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in primary sensory neurons could lead to long-lasting relief of nerve pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurexin-{beta} Mediates the Synaptogenic Activity of Amyloid Precursor Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid precursor protein (APP) has physiological roles in synapse development and function. APP induces presynaptic differentiation when presented to axons, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that APP binds neurexin to mediate this synaptogenic activity. APP specifically binds &beta; not &alpha; neurexins modulated by splice site 4. Binding to neurexin heparan sulfate glycan and LNS protein domains is required for high-affinity interaction and for full-length APP to recruit axonal neurexin. The synaptogenic activity of APP is abolished by triple knockdown of neurexins in hippocampal neurons pooled from male and female rats. Based on these and previous results, our model is that a dendritic-axonal <I>trans</I> dimer of full-length APP binds to axonal neurexin-&beta; to promote synaptic differentiation and function. Furthermore, soluble sAPPs also bind neurexin-&beta; and inhibit its interaction with neuroligin-1, raising the possibility that disruption of neurexin function by altered levels of full-length APP and its cleavage products may contribute to early synaptic deficits in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The prevailing model for the basis of Alzheimer's disease is the amyloid cascade triggered by altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP also has physiological roles at the synapse, but the molecular basis for its synaptic functions is not well understood. Here, we show that APP binds the presynaptic organizing protein neurexin-&beta; and that neurexin is essential for the synaptogenic activity of APP. Furthermore, soluble APP forms generated by APP cleavage also bind neurexin-&beta; and can block interaction with transmembrane synaptogenic ligands of neurexin. These findings reveal a role for neurexin-APP interaction in synapse development and raise the possibility that disruptions of neurexin function may contribute to synaptic and cognitive deficits in the critical early stage of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Vulnerability of the Neonatal Connectome following Postnatal Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stress following preterm birth can disrupt the emerging foundation of the neonatal brain. The current study examined how structural brain development is affected by a stressful early environment and whether changes in topological architecture at term-equivalent age could explain the increased vulnerability for behavioral symptoms during early childhood. Longitudinal changes in structural brain connectivity were quantified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography in preterm born infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks), imaged at 30 and/or 40 weeks of gestation (<I>N</I> = 145, 43.5% female). A global index of postnatal stress was determined based on the number of invasive procedures during hospitalization (e.g., heel lance). Higher stress levels impaired structural connectivity growth in a subnetwork of 48 connections (<I>p</I> = 0.003), including the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Findings were replicated in an independent validation sample (<I>N</I> = 123, 39.8% female, <I>n</I> = 91 with follow-up). Classifying infants into vulnerable and resilient based on having more or less internalizing symptoms at two to five years of age (<I>n</I> = 71) revealed lower connectivity in the hippocampus and amygdala for vulnerable relative to resilient infants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that higher stress exposure during hospital admission is associated with slower growth of structural connectivity. The preservation of global connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus might reflect a stress-buffering or resilience-enhancing factor against a stressful early environment and early-childhood internalizing symptoms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The preterm brain is exposed to various external stimuli following birth. The effects of early chronic stress on neonatal brain networks and the remarkable degree of resilience are not well understood. The current study aims to provide an increased understanding of the impact of postnatal stress on third-trimester brain development and describe the topological architecture of a resilient brain. We observed a sparser neonatal brain network in infants exposed to higher postnatal stress. Limbic regulatory regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala, may play a key role as crucial convergence sites of protective factors. Understanding how stress-induced alterations in early brain development might lead to brain (re)organization may provide essential insights into resilient functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Object Boundary Detection in Natural Images May Depend on "Incitatory" Cell-Cell Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional "simple cells," we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes' rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified the following three basic types of cell&ndash;cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, and nonmonotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models, we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition&mdash;a compound effect we call "incitation"&mdash;can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell&ndash;boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer "delta" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell&mdash;a divisively normalized linear filter&mdash;is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell&ndash;cell interconnections in the cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Weakly Correlated Local Cortical State Switches under Anesthesia Lead to Strongly Correlated Global States</a></h4>

              
                <p>During recovery from anesthesia, brain activity switches abruptly between a small set of discrete states. Surprisingly, this switching also occurs under constant doses of anesthesia, even in the absence of stimuli. These metastable states and the transitions between them are thought to form a "scaffold" that ultimately guides the brain back to wakefulness. The processes that constrain cortical activity patterns to these states and govern how states are coordinated between different cortical regions are unknown. If state transitions were driven by subcortical modulation, different cortical sites should exhibit near-synchronous state transitions. Conversely, spatiotemporal heterogeneity would suggest that state transitions are coordinated through corticocortical interactions. To differentiate between these hypotheses, we quantified synchrony of brain states in male rats exposed to a fixed isoflurane concentration. States were defined from spectra of local field potentials recorded across layers of visual and motor cortices. A transition synchrony measure shows that most state transitions are highly localized. Furthermore, while most pairs of cortical sites exhibit statistically significant coupling of both states and state transition times, coupling strength is typically weak. States and state transitions in the thalamic input layer (L4) are particularly decoupled from those in supragranular and infragranular layers. This suggests that state transitions are not imposed on the cortex by broadly projecting modulatory systems. Although each pairwise interaction is typically weak, we show that the multitude of such weak interactions is sufficient to confine global activity to a small number of discrete states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain consistently recovers to wakefulness after anesthesia, but this process is poorly understood. Previous work revealed that, during recovery from anesthesia, corticothalamic activity falls into one of several discrete patterns. The neuronal mechanisms constraining the cortex to just a few discrete states remain unknown. Global states could be coordinated by fluctuations in subcortical nuclei that project broadly to the cortex. Alternatively, these states may emerge from interactions within the cortex itself. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating that most pairs of cortical sites exhibit weak coupling. We thereby lay groundwork for future investigations of the specific cellular and network mechanisms of corticocortical activity state coupling.</p>

                <p>The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) are involved in diverse motivated behaviors based on rodent models. These structures are conserved, but expanded, in higher primates, including human. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a canonical "stress molecule" associated with the CEA and VP circuitry across species, is dynamically regulated by stress and drugs of abuse and misuse. CRF's effects on circuits critically depend on its colocation with primary "fast" transmitters, making this crucial for understanding circuit effects. We surveyed the distribution and colocalization of CRF-, VGluT2- (vesicular glutamate transporter 2), and VGAT- (vesicular GABA transporter) mRNA in specific subregions of the CEA and VP in young male monkeys. Although CRF-containing neurons were clustered in the lateral central bed nucleus (BSTLcn), the majority were broadly dispersed throughout other CEA subregions, and the VP. CRF/VGAT-only neurons were highest in the BSTLcn, lateral central amygdala nucleus (CeLcn), and medial central amygdala nucleus (CeM) (74%, 73%, and 85%, respectively). In contrast, lower percentages of CRF/VGAT only neurons populated the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEAc), ventrolateral bed nucleus (BSTLP), and VP (53%, 54%, 17%, respectively), which had higher complements of CRF/VGAT/VGluT2-labeled neurons (33%, 29%, 67%, respectively). Thus, the majority of CRF-neurons at the "poles" (BSTLcn and CeLcn/CeM) of the CEA are inhibitory, while the "extended" BSTLP and SLEAc subregions, and neighboring VP, have a more complex profile with admixtures of "multiplexed" excitatory CRF neurons. CRF's colocalization with its various fast transmitters is likely circuit-specific, and relevant for understanding CRF actions on specific target sites.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) regulate multiple motivated behaviors through differential downstream projections. The stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is enriched in the CEA, and is thought to "set the gain" through modulatory effects on coexpressed primary transmitters. Using protein and transcript assays in monkey, we found that CRF neurons are broadly and diffusely distributed in CEA and VP. CRF mRNA<sup>+</sup> neurons colocalize with VGAT (GABA) and VGluT2 (glutamate) mRNAs in different proportions depending on subregion. CRF mRNA was also coexpressed in a subpopulation of VGAT/VGluT2 mRNA ("multiplexed") cells, which were most prominent in the VP and "pallidal"-like parts of the CEA. Heterogeneous CRF and fast transmitter coexpression across CEA/VP subregions implies circuit-specific effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interdigitated Columnar Representation of Personal Space and Visual Space in Human Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Personal space (PS) is the space around the body that people prefer to maintain between themselves and unfamiliar others. Intrusion into personal space evokes discomfort and an urge to move away. Physiologic studies in nonhuman primates suggest that defensive responses to intruding stimuli involve the parietal cortex. We hypothesized that the spatial encoding of interpersonal distance is initially transformed from purely sensory to more egocentric mapping within human parietal cortex. This hypothesis was tested using 7 Tesla (7T) fMRI at high spatial resolution (1.1 mm isotropic), in seven subjects (four females, three males). In response to visual stimuli presented at a range of virtual distances, we found two categories of distance encoding in two corresponding radially-extending columns of activity within parietal cortex. One set of columns (P columns) responded selectively to moving and stationary face images presented at virtual distances that were nearer (but not farther) than each subject's behaviorally-defined personal space boundary. In most P columns, BOLD response amplitudes increased monotonically and nonlinearly with increasing virtual face proximity. In the remaining P columns, BOLD responses decreased with increasing proximity. A second set of parietal columns (D columns) responded selectively to disparity-based distance cues (near or far) in random dot stimuli, similar to disparity-selective columns described previously in occipital cortex. Critically, in parietal cortex, P columns were topographically interdigitated (nonoverlapping) with D columns. These results suggest that visual spatial information is transformed from visual to body-centered (or person-centered) dimensions in multiple local sites within human parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent COVID-related social distancing practices highlight the need to better understand brain mechanisms which regulate "personal space" (PS), which is defined by the closest interpersonal distance that is comfortable for an individual. Using high spatial resolution brain imaging, we tested whether a map of external space is transformed from purely visual (3D-based) information to a more egocentric map (related to personal space) in human parietal cortex. We confirmed this transformation and further showed that it was mediated by two mutually segregated sets of columns: one which encoded interpersonal distance and another that encoded visual distance. These results suggest that the cortical transformation of sensory-centered to person-centered encoding of space near the body involves short-range communication across interdigitated columns within parietal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Common Neural Account for Social and Nonsocial Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>To date, social and nonsocial decisions have been studied largely in isolation. Consequently, the extent to which social and nonsocial forms of decision uncertainty are integrated using shared neurocomputational resources remains elusive. Here, we address this question using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy human participants (young adults of both sexes) and a task in which decision evidence in social and nonsocial contexts varies along comparable scales. First, we identify time-resolved build-up of activity in the EEG, akin to a process of evidence accumulation (EA), across both contexts. We then use the endogenous trial-by-trial variability in the slopes of these accumulating signals to construct parametric fMRI predictors. We show that a region of the posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC) uniquely explains trial-wise variability in the process of evidence accumulation in both social and nonsocial contexts. We further demonstrate a task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human valuation system in dorso-medial and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations in regions known to encode the early decision evidence for each context. These results are suggestive of a domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is likely converted into a "common currency" in medial prefrontal cortex and accumulated for the decision in the pMFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Little work has directly compared social-versus-nonsocial decisions to investigate whether they share common neurocomputational origins. Here, using combined electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling, we offer a detailed spatiotemporal account of the neural underpinnings of social and nonsocial decisions. Specifically, we identify a comparable mechanism of temporal evidence integration driving both decisions and localize this integration process in posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC). We further demonstrate task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human valuation system across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations in regions encoding the early, domain-specific, decision evidence. These results suggest a domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is converted into a common representation in the valuation system and integrated for the decision in the pMFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maladaptive Laterality in Cortical Networks Related to Social Communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimaging studies of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) consistently find an aberrant pattern of reduced laterality in brain networks that support functions related to social communication and language. However, it is unclear how the underlying functional organization of these brain networks is altered in ASD individuals. We tested four models of reduced laterality in a social communication network in 70 ASD individuals (14 females) and a control group of the same number of tightly matched typically developing (TD) individuals (19 females) using high-quality resting-state fMRI data and a method of measuring patterns of functional laterality across the brain. We found that a functionally defined social communication network exhibited the typical pattern of left laterality in both groups, whereas there was a significant increase in within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity of homotopic regions in the right hemisphere in ASD individuals. Furthermore, greater within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with a measure of verbal ability in both groups, whereas greater within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the right hemisphere in ASD, but not TD, individuals was negatively correlated with the same verbal measure. Crucially, these differences in patterns of laterality were not found in two other functional networks and were specifically correlated to a measure of verbal ability but not metrics of other core components of the ASD phenotype. These results suggest that previous reports of reduced laterality in social communication regions in ASD is because of the two hemispheres functioning more independently than seen in TD individuals, with the atypical right-hemisphere network component being maladaptive.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A consistent neuroimaging finding in individuals with ASD is an aberrant pattern of reduced laterality of the brain networks that support functions related to social communication and language. We tested four models of reduced laterality in a social communication network in ASD individuals and a TD control group using high-quality resting-state fMRI data. Our results suggest that reduced laterality of social communication regions in ASD may be because of the two hemispheres functioning more independently than seen in TD individuals, with atypically greater within- than across-hemisphere connectivity in the right hemisphere being maladaptive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Competition between Statistical Learning and Episodic Memory in Intracranial Recordings of Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The function of long-term memory is not just to reminisce about the past, but also to make predictions that help us behave appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic question from memory research of why we remember some things but not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that this information already exists in memory and need not be encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy patients of both sexes viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of which contained regularities that allowed the category of the next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by predictive items that were subsequently forgotten. Such interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information that could help learn new predictive relationships.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When faced with a new experience, we are rarely at a loss for what to do. Rather, because many aspects of the world are stable over time, we rely on past experiences to generate expectations that guide behavior. Here we show that these expectations during a new experience come at the expense of memory for that experience. From intracranial recordings of visual cortex, we decoded what humans expected to see next in a series of photographs based on patterns of neural activity. Photographs that generated strong neural expectations were more likely to be forgotten in a later behavioral memory test. Prioritizing the storage of experiences that currently lead to weak expectations could help improve these expectations in future encounters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Abstract Encoding of Categorical Decisions in Medial Superior Temporal and Lateral Intraparietal Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Categorization is an essential cognitive and perceptual process for decision-making and recognition. The posterior parietal cortex, particularly the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has been suggested to transform visual feature encoding into abstract categorical representations. By contrast, areas closer to sensory input, such as the middle temporal (MT) area, encode stimulus features but not more abstract categorical information during categorization tasks. Here, we compare the contributions of the medial superior temporal (MST) and LIP areas in category computation by recording neuronal activity in both areas from two male rhesus macaques trained to perform a visual motion categorization task. MST is a core motion-processing region interconnected with MT and is often considered an intermediate processing stage between MT and LIP. We show that MST exhibits robust decision-correlated motion category encoding and working memory encoding similar to LIP, suggesting that MST plays a substantial role in cognitive computation, extending beyond its widely recognized role in visual motion processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Categorization requires assigning incoming sensory stimuli into behaviorally relevant groups. Previous work found that parietal area LIP shows a strong encoding of the learned category membership of visual motion stimuli, while visual area MT shows strong direction tuning but not category tuning during a motion direction categorization task. Here we show that the medial superior temporal (MST) area, a visual motion-processing region interconnected with both LIP and MT, shows strong visual category encoding similar to that observed in LIP. This suggests that MST plays a greater role in abstract cognitive functions, extending beyond its well known role in visual motion processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amplified Gliosis and Interferon-Associated Inflammation in the Aging Brain following Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with chronic psychiatric complications and increased risk for development of neurodegenerative pathology. Aged individuals account for most TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths. Nonetheless, neurobiological mechanisms that underlie worsened functional outcomes after TBI in the elderly remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to identify pathways that govern differential responses to TBI with age. Here, adult (2 months of age) and aged (16&ndash;18 months of age) male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to diffuse brain injury (midline fluid percussion), and cognition, gliosis, and neuroinflammation were determined 7 or 30 d postinjury (dpi). Cognitive impairment was evident 7 dpi, independent of age. There was enhanced morphologic restructuring of microglia and astrocytes 7 dpi in the cortex and hippocampus of aged mice compared with adults. Transcriptional analysis revealed robust age-dependent amplification of cytokine/chemokine, complement, innate immune, and interferon-associated inflammatory gene expression in the cortex 7 dpi. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the transcriptional data showed that type I interferon (IFN) signaling was significantly enhanced in the aged brain after TBI compared with adults. Age prolonged inflammatory signaling and microgliosis 30 dpi with an increased presence of rod microglia. Based on these results, a STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist, DMXAA, was used to determine whether augmenting IFN signaling worsened cortical inflammation and gliosis after TBI. DMXAA-treated Adult-TBI mice showed comparable expression of myriad genes that were overexpressed in the cortex of Aged-TBI mice, including <I>Irf7</I>, <I>Clec7a</I>, <I>Cxcl10</I>, and <I>Ccl5</I>. Overall, diffuse TBI promoted amplified IFN signaling in aged mice, resulting in extended inflammation and gliosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elderly individuals are at higher risk of complications following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Individuals &gt;70 years old have the highest rates of TBI-related hospitalization, neurodegenerative pathology, and death. Although inflammation has been linked with poor outcomes in aging, the specific biological pathways driving worsened outcomes after TBI in aging remain undefined. In this study, we identify amplified interferon-associated inflammation and gliosis in aged mice following TBI that was associated with persistent inflammatory gene expression and microglial morphologic diversity 30 dpi. STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist DMXAA was used to demonstrate a causal link between augmented interferon signaling and worsened neuroinflammation after TBI. Therefore, interferon signaling may represent a therapeutic target to reduce inflammation-associated complications following TBI.</p>

                Background: Mental foramen (MF) and its accessories are the important anatomical considerations while placing implants or doing surgical procedures in and around the mandibular premolar region. This study aimed to evaluate the shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous patients among the Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans that were taken between 2015 and 2020 from Riyadh Elm University were retrieved. A total of 180 samples of CBCT (90 dentate and 90 edentulous) were analyzed. Prevalence of different horizontal positions of the mental foramen (P1 to P6) and other additive parameters like the distance from mental foramen to alveolar crest and inferior border of the mandible, along with the mental foramen angle was assessed. The difference in the mental foramen location among dentate and edentulous subjects was assessed. Gender and age variation also was assessed. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Results: The predominant horizontal position is P4 followed by P3 (59 % in males and 63 % in females at P4, and 15 % each in males and females at P3, respectively). The horizontal position of the mental foramen and gender showed a statistical significance difference, especially at the P3B, P5, and P4 positions. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was seen in the mental foramen to the mandibular inferior border of the mandible (MF_MSB) and the width of mental foramen in the transverse section (MFW). Comparison of the mental foramen among dentate and edentulous subjects showed a statistically significant difference. There was a change in the mental foramen with age. Conclusions: Based on the methodology and sample of this study, it can be concluded that the edentulism only reduced the dimension of the mental foramen opening.

                Endocrine therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer is a significant issue to be tackled, but currently, no specific biomarker could be used to anticipate this event. p53 mutation is widely known as one of Breast Cancer’s most prominent genetic alterations. Its mutation could generate various effects in Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor molecular works, tangled in events leading to the aggravation of endocrine therapy resistance. Hence the possibility of p53 mutation utilization as an endocrine therapy resistance predictive biomarker is plausible. The purpose of this review is to explore the latest knowledge of p53 role in Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor molecular actions, thus aggravating the Endocrine Therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer, from which we could define possibilities and limitations to utilize p53 as the predictive biomarker of endocrine therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer.

                Background: HNP1, LL-37, and HBD1 are antimicrobial against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 at the standard inoculum but less active at higher inocula.   Methods: The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay was adapted for high inocula and the addition of yeast tRNA and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase).  96-well plates were read for 12 hours in a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader and photographed under 10x magnification.    Results: Adding tRNA 1:1 wt/wt to HNP1 at the standard inoculum almost completely abrogated activity.  Adding RNase 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum of 5x105 CFU/mL did not enhance activity.  Increasing the inoculum to 6.25x107 CFU/mL almost abrogated HNP1 activity.  However, adding RNase 25:1 to HNP1 enhanced activity at the highest tested concentration of HNP1.  Adding both tRNA and RNase resulted in enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancement effect of RNase overwhelms the inhibiting effect of tRNA when both are present.  HBD1 activity at the standard inoculum was almost completely abrogated by the addition of tRNA, but LL-37 activity was only slightly inhibited by tRNA.  At the high inoculum, LL-37 activity was enhanced by RNase.  HBD1 activity was not enhanced by RNase.  RNase was not antimicrobial in the absence of antimicrobial peptides.  Cell clumps were observed at the high inoculum in the presence of all three antimicrobial peptides and at the standard inoculum in the presence of HNP1+tRNA and HBD1+tRNA.    Conclusions: Antimicrobial peptide-ribonuclease combinations have the potential to be active against high cell concentrations and biofilms, conditions where the antimicrobial agent alone is relatively ineffective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of brand equity and service quality on the reputation of universities and students’ intention to choose them: The case of IIUM and UIN [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous studies have been carried out on the impacts of brand equity and service quality of higher education institutions (HEIs) on their reputation and students’ satisfaction. This research aimed to compare the impact of brand equity and service quality on universities’ reputations, namely Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) in Indonesia and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) in Malaysia, and Indonesian students’ intention to choose the universities, which is moderated by study expense (price). UIN and IIUM are HEIs with a similar university concept, and Indonesian students have recently shown a high interest in them. The two universities have faculties not only in the field of Islamic studies but in general fields of studies as well, which are usually held by non-Islamic Universities. Therefore, their competitiveness against non-Islamic universities, especially the University of Indonesia (UI) has increased. Methods: The statistical measurement tool used was structural equation modeling (SEM). The number of items stated in the questionnaire was 45. Therefore, minimum data to be collected were 5 × 45 or 225 which rounded up to 228 from Indonesian students at UIN and IIUM (114 UIN students, and 114 Indonesian student respondents from IIUM). Results: The study results show that the universities’ reputations are strongly affected by their brand equity and service quality, which then affect students’ intention to choose the universities. Students had a higher intention to choose IIUM than UIN. The limitation of this research is that the effect of study expense on the intention of Indonesian students to study at UIN or IIUM has not yet been conducted. It will be conducted in the next study. Conclusions: These results are expected to be useful to UIN, IIUM, and especially Politeknik Negeri Jakarta (PNJ) in determining a strategy to enhance their reputations and the intention of Indonesian students to study there.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors in astrocytes exert different effects on behavior and Alzheimer´s-like pathology [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Validation of a Thai artificial chatmate designed for cheering up the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected populations of all age groups. The elderly are a high-risk group and are highly vulnerable to COVID-19. Assistive software chatbots can enhance the mental health status of the elderly by providing support and companionship. The objective of this study was to validate a Thai artificial chatmate for the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. Methods: Chatbot design includes the establishment of a dataset and emotional word vectors in which data consisting of emotional sentences were converted into the word vector form using a pre-trained word2vec model. A word vector was then input into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained until the model converges using sentence embedding and similarity word segmentation. Sentence vectors were generated by averaging each word vector using an averaged vector method. For approximate similarity matching, the Annoy library was used to create the indices in tree sorting. Data were collected from 22 elderly and assessed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Results: The study revealed that 72.73% of the respondents found the chatbot easy to learn and use, 63.64% of the respondents found the chatbot can autonomously determine the next course of action, and 59.09% of the respondents believed that troubleshooting guidelines were provided for overcoming errors. The accuracy of the chatbot providing a reasonable response is 56.20±13.99%. Conclusions: Most users were satisfied with the chatbot system. The proposed chatbot provided considerable essential insights into the development of assistance systems for the elderly during the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and during the period of national disasters. The model can be expanded to other applications in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Fatty acid composition on diet and carcasses, growth, body indices and profile serum of Asian redtail catfish (Hemibagrus nemurus) fed a diet containing different levels of EPA and DHA [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Asian redtail catfish Hemibagrus nemurus is a promising commercial aquaculture freshwater big-sized Bagridae catfish across Asian countries such as the Mekong, Malay Peninsula, and Indonesia. This study analysed the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) supplementation in diets on changes in fatty acid compositions in feed and fish meat, lipid quality (atherogenic index and thrombogenic index), growth rate, body indicators, and serum metabolites of Hemibagrus nemurus juveniles. Methods: A total of 180 Asian redtail catfish (initial weight 54.80 ± 2.72 g) were fed four levels (0, 3,150, 6,300, and 9,450 mg of EPA+DHA/kg feed) sourced from fish oil. Diets were fed in triplicate in freshwater tarpaulin ponds, with 15 fish per tarpaulin pond. During the experiment, fish were fed 3% per day of the biomass weight. Results: Categorically, there were significant differences in the composition of fatty acids in the feed and fish meat. The atherogenic index was between 1.76 and 1.84, and the thrombogenic index was between 0.81 and 0.89 in all fish meat. Growth performance was significantly different between diets, while body indices did not make a significant difference between diets. The fish meat EPA and DHA showed positive linear relationships with diet EPA (p <0.001, r2 = 90%) and DHA diet (p<0.001, r2 = 85%). Serum metabolites among treatments D2 and D3 diet-fed feed for 60 days did not significantly differ. Glucose (GLU) levels had moderate relationships with triglycerides (TAG) (r2 = 65%), and GLU levels strongly correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (r2 = 81%). Conclusions: Based on diets and whole-body carcass compositions, growth performance, and serum metabolites, Asian redtail catfish fed a diet containing 6,300 mg of EPA+DHA/kg feed are best for food safety.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the synergistic effect of bacteriophage and antibiotics on bacteria: Killers and drivers of resistance evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quentin J. Leclerc, Jodi A. Lindsay, Gwenan M. Knight</p>

Bacteriophage (phage) are bacterial predators that can also spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes between bacteria by generalised transduction. Phage are often present alongside antibiotics in the environment, yet evidence of their joint killing effect on bacteria is conflicted, and the dynamics of transduction in such systems are unknown. Here, we combine <i>in vitro</i> data and mathematical modelling to identify conditions where phage and antibiotics act in synergy to remove bacteria or drive AMR evolution. We adapt a published model of phage-bacteria dynamics, including transduction, to add the pharmacodynamics of erythromycin and tetracycline, parameterised from new <i>in vitro</i> data. We simulate a system where two strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> are present at stationary phase, each carrying either an erythromycin or tetracycline resistance gene, and where multidrug-resistant bacteria can be generated by transduction only. We determine rates of bacterial clearance and multidrug-resistant bacteria appearance, when either or both antibiotics and phage are present at varying timings and concentrations. Although phage and antibiotics act in synergy to kill bacteria, by reducing bacterial growth antibiotics reduce phage production. A low concentration of phage introduced shortly after antibiotics fails to replicate and exert a strong killing pressure on bacteria, instead generating multidrug-resistant bacteria by transduction which are then selected for by the antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant bacteria numbers were highest when antibiotics and phage were introduced simultaneously. The interaction between phage and antibiotics leads to a trade-off between a slower clearing rate of bacteria (if antibiotics are added before phage), and a higher risk of multidrug-resistance evolution (if phage are added before antibiotics), exacerbated by low concentrations of phage or antibiotics. Our results form hypotheses to guide future experimental and clinical work on the impact of phage on AMR evolution, notably for studies of phage therapy which should investigate varying timings and concentrations of phage and antibiotics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimized phylogenetic clustering of HIV-1 sequence data for public health applications</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Connor Chato, Yi Feng, Yuhua Ruan, Hui Xing, Joshua Herbeck, Marcia Kalish, Art F. Y. Poon</p>

Clusters of genetically similar infections suggest rapid transmission and may indicate priorities for public health action or reveal underlying epidemiological processes. However, clusters often require user-defined thresholds and are sensitive to non-epidemiological factors, such as non-random sampling. Consequently the ideal threshold for public health applications varies substantially across settings. Here, we show a method which selects optimal thresholds for phylogenetic (subset tree) clustering based on population. We evaluated this method on HIV-1 <i>pol</i> datasets (<i>n</i> = 14, 221 sequences) from four sites in USA (Tennessee, Washington), Canada (Northern Alberta) and China (Beijing). Clusters were defined by tips descending from an ancestral node (with a minimum bootstrap support of 95%) through a series of branches, each with a length below a given threshold. Next, we used <i>pplacer</i> to graft new cases to the fixed tree by maximum likelihood. We evaluated the effect of varying branch-length thresholds on cluster growth as a count outcome by fitting two Poisson regression models: a null model that predicts growth from cluster size, and an alternative model that includes mean collection date as an additional covariate. The alternative model was favoured by AIC across most thresholds, with optimal (greatest difference in AIC) thresholds ranging 0.007–0.013 across sites. The range of optimal thresholds was more variable when re-sampling 80% of the data by location (IQR 0.008 − 0.016, <i>n</i> = 100 replicates). Our results use prospective phylogenetic cluster growth and suggest that there is more variation in effective thresholds for public health than those typically used in clustering studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cluster detection with random neighbourhood covering: Application to invasive Group A Streptococcal disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Massimo Cavallaro, Juliana Coelho, Derren Ready, Valerie Decraene, Theresa Lamagni, Noel D. McCarthy, Dan Todkill, Matt J. Keeling</p>

The rapid detection of outbreaks is a key step in the effective control and containment of infectious diseases. In particular, the identification of cases which might be epidemiologically linked is crucial in directing outbreak-containment efforts and shaping the intervention of public health authorities. Often this requires the detection of clusters of cases whose numbers exceed those expected by a background of sporadic cases. Quantifying exceedances rapidly is particularly challenging when only few cases are typically reported in a precise location and time. To address such important public health concerns, we present a general method which can detect spatio-temporal deviations from a Poisson point process and estimate the odds of an isolate being part of a cluster. This method can be applied to diseases where detailed geographical information is available. In addition, we propose an approach to explicitly take account of delays in microbial typing. As a case study, we considered invasive group A Streptococcus infection events as recorded and typed by Public Health England from 2015 to 2020.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking human skill learning with a hierarchical Bayesian sequence model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noémi Éltető, Dezső Nemeth, Karolina Janacsek, Peter Dayan</p>

Humans can implicitly learn complex perceptuo-motor skills over the course of large numbers of trials. This likely depends on our becoming better able to take advantage of ever richer and temporally deeper predictive relationships in the environment. Here, we offer a novel characterization of this process, fitting a non-parametric, hierarchical Bayesian sequence model to the reaction times of human participants’ responses over ten sessions, each comprising thousands of trials, in a serial reaction time task involving higher-order dependencies. The model, adapted from the domain of language, forgetfully updates trial-by-trial, and seamlessly combines predictive information from shorter and longer windows onto past events, weighing the windows proportionally to their predictive power. As the model implies a posterior over window depths, we were able to determine how, and how many, previous sequence elements influenced individual participants’ internal predictions, and how this changed with practice.
Already in the first session, the model showed that participants had begun to rely on two previous elements (i.e., trigrams), thereby successfully adapting to the most prominent higher-order structure in the task. The extent to which local statistical fluctuations influenced participants’ responses waned over subsequent sessions, as subjects forgot the trigrams less and evidenced skilled performance. By the eighth session, a subset of participants shifted their prior further to consider a context deeper than two previous elements. Finally, participants showed resistance to interference and slow forgetting of the old sequence when it was changed in the final sessions. Model parameters for individual subjects covaried appropriately with independent measures of working memory. In sum, the model offers the first principled account of the adaptive complexity and nuanced dynamics of humans’ internal sequence representations during long-term implicit skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of SaCas9 orthologs containing a conserved serine residue that determines simple NNGG PAM recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuai Wang, Chen Tao, Huilin Mao, Linghui Hou, Yao Wang, Tao Qi, Yuan Yang, Sang-Ging Ong, Shijun Hu, Renjie Chai, Yongming Wang</p>

Due to different nucleotide preferences at target sites, no single Cas9 is capable of editing all sequences. Thus, this highlights the need to establish a Cas9 repertoire covering all sequences for efficient genome editing. Cas9s with simple protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements are particularly attractive to allow for a wide range of genome editing, but identification of such Cas9s from thousands of Cas9s in the public database is a challenge. We previously identified PAMs for 16 SaCas9 orthologs. Here, we compared the PAM-interacting (PI) domains in these orthologs and found that the serine residue corresponding to SaCas9 N986 was associated with the simple NNGG PAM requirement. Based on this discovery, we identified five additional SaCas9 orthologs that recognize the NNGG PAM. We further identified three amino acids that determined the NNGG PAM requirement of SaCas9. Finally, we engineered Sha2Cas9 and SpeCas9 to generate high-fidelity versions of Cas9s. Importantly, these natural and engineered Cas9s displayed high activities and distinct nucleotide preferences. Our study offers a new perspective to identify SaCas9 orthologs with NNGG PAM requirements, expanding the Cas9 repertoire.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a 4R-tauopathy showing heterogeneous tau cytopathology commencing in the globus pallidus (GP) and the substantia nigra (SN), regions also associated with age-related iron accumulation. Abnormal iron levels have been extensively associated with tau pathology in neurodegenerative brains, however, its role in PSP pathogenesis remains yet unknown. We perform the first cell type-specific evaluation of PSP iron homeostasis and the closely related oxygen homeostasis, in relation to tau pathology in human postmortem PSP brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In brain regions vulnerable to PSP pathology (GP, SN, and putamen), we visualized iron deposition in tau-affected and unaffected neurons, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, using a combination of iron staining with immunolabelling. To further explore molecular pathways underlying our observations, we examined the expression of key iron and oxygen homeostasis mRNA transcripts and proteins.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found astrocytes as the major cell type accumulating iron in the early affected regions of PSP, highly associated with cellular tau pathology. The same regions are affected by dysregulated expression of alpha and beta hemoglobin and neuroglobin showing contrasting patterns. We discovered changes in iron and oxygen homeostasis-related gene expression associated with aging of the brain, and identified dysregulated expression of rare neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) genes associated with tau pathology to distinguish PSP from the healthy aging brain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present novel aspects of PSP pathophysiology highlighting an overlap with NBIA pathways. Our findings reveal potential novel targets for therapy development and have implications beyond PSP for other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase improves reperfusion compared to alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions. To determine whether this improvement varies across the spectrum of thrombolytic agent to reperfusion assessment times, we performed a comparative analysis of tenecteplase and alteplase reperfusion rates.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with large vessel occlusion and treatment with thrombolysis were pooled from the Melbourne Stroke Registry, and the EXTEND-IA and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. The primary outcome, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or &gt;50% reperfusion at imaging reassessment. We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase and alteplase, accounting for thrombolytic to assessment exposure times, via Poisson modeling. We compared 90-day outcomes of patients who achieved reperfusion with a thrombolytic to patients who achieved reperfusion via endovascular therapy using ordinal logistic regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 893 patients included in the primary analysis, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion was observed in 184 (21%) patients. Tenecteplase was associated with higher rates of reperfusion (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09–2.07, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Findings were consistent in patient subgroups with first segment (aIRR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.93–2.14) and second segment (aIRR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.98–4.37) middle cerebral artery occlusions. Increased thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times were associated with reperfusion (tenecteplase: adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.08 per 15 minutes, 95% CI = 1.04–1.13 vs alteplase: aRR = 1.06 per 15 minutes, 95% CI = 1.00–1.13). No significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.87). Reperfusion via thrombolysis was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores (adjusted common odds ratio = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.54–3.01) compared to patients who achieved reperfusion following endovascular therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tenecteplase, compared to alteplase, increases prethrombectomy reperfusion, regardless of the time from administration to reperfusion assessment. Prethrombectomy reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tubers Affecting the Fusiform Face Area Are Associated with Autism Diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is associated with focal brain “tubers” and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The location of brain tubers associated with autism may provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of ASD symptoms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We delineated tuber locations for 115 TSC participants with ASD (n = 31) and without ASD (n = 84) from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network. We tested for associations between ASD diagnosis and tuber burden within the whole brain, specific lobes, and at 8 regions of interest derived from the ASD neuroimaging literature, including the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices, inferior frontal and fusiform gyri, superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, and supplemental motor area. Next, we performed an unbiased data-driven voxelwise lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis. Finally, we calculated the risk of ASD associated with positive findings from the above analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were no significant ASD-related differences in tuber burden across the whole brain, within specific lobes, or within a priori regions derived from the ASD literature. However, using VLSM analysis, we found that tubers involving the right fusiform face area (FFA) were associated with a 3.7-fold increased risk of developing ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although TSC is a rare cause of ASD, there is a strong association between tuber involvement of the right FFA and ASD diagnosis. This highlights a potentially causative mechanism for developing autism in TSC that may guide research into ASD symptoms more generally. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Phase 1 Evaluation of Elezanumab (Anti–Repulsive Guidance Molecule A Monoclonal Antibody) in Healthy and Multiple Sclerosis Participants</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to describe the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of elezanumab (ABT-555), a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), in healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) study participants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The single-center, first-in-human, single ascending dose (SAD) study evaluated elezanumab (50–1,600mg intravenous [IV] and 150mg subcutaneous) in 47 healthy men and women. The multicenter multiple ascending dose (MAD; NCT02601885) study evaluated elezanumab (150mg, 600mg, and 1,800mg) in 20 adult men and women with MS, receiving either maintenance or no immunomodulatory treatment.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No pattern of study drug-related adverse events was identified for either the SAD or MAD elezanumab regimens. Across both studies, the T<sub>max</sub> occurred within 4 hours of elezanumab IV infusion, and the harmonic mean of <i>t</i>
<sub>1/2</sub> ranged between 18.6 and 67.7 days. Following multiple dosing, elezanumab C<sub>max</sub>, area under the curve, and C<sub>trough</sub> increased dose-proportionally and resulted in dose-dependent increases in elezanumab cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. Elezanumab CSF penetration was 0.1% to 0.4% across both studies, with CSF levels of free RGMa decreased by &gt;40%. Changes in CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) and free RGMa demonstrated dose/exposure-dependence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The elezanumab pharmacokinetic profile supports monthly, or bimonthly, administration of up to 1,800mg with the option of a loading dose of 3,600mg. Elezanumab partitioning into CSF is within the range expected for mAbs. Reduced CSF levels of free RGMa demonstrate central nervous system target binding of elezanumab with an apparent maximal effect at 1,800mg IV. Exposure-associated increases in CSF IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine with neuroprotective/neurorestorative properties, support potential pathway modulation in MS participants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging biochemical reactions to unravel functional impacts of cancer somatic variants affecting protein interaction interfaces [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

                Background: The loss of E-cadherin expression and the induction of N-cadherin are known as hallmarks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, an essential initial step in the process of metastasis in solid tumors. Although several studies have reported expressions of these cadherins in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), their clinical significance is unknown as MM cells are non-epithelial. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression of E- and N-cadherins by immunohistochemistry using bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens from 31 newly diagnosed MM patients and in subsequent biopsy specimens from six of these. Results: Negative E-cadherin expression on BM myeloma cell membranes was significantly associated with the presence of soft-tissue masses arising from bone lesions and breaking through the cortical bone, referred to as extramedullary disease (EMD). Conclusions: Given the aggressive nature of EMD, our study suggests that screening for E-cadherin using BM immunohistochemistry is one measure that could predict the development of EMD in patients with MM.

                The respiratory tract is a compartmentalised and heterogenous environment. The nasopharynx and sinuses of the upper airways have distinct properties from the lungs and these differences may shape bacterial adaptation and evolution. Upper airway niches act as early colonisation sites for respiratory bacterial pathogens, including those, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that can go on to establish chronic infection of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the importance of upper airway environments in facilitating early adaptation to host environments, currently available in vitro models for study of respiratory infection in CF focus exclusively on the lungs. Furthermore, animal models, widely used to bridge the gap between in vitro systems and the clinical scenario, do not allow the upper and lower airways to be studied in isolation. We have developed a suite of culture media reproducing key features of the upper and lower airways, for the study of bacterial adaptation and evolution in different respiratory environments. For both upper and lower airway-mimicking media, we have developed formulations that reflect airway conditions in health and those that reflect the altered environment of the CF respiratory tract. Here, we describe the development and validation of these media and their use for study of genetic and phenotypic adaptations in P. aeruginosa during growth under upper or lower airway conditions in health and in CF.

                Background: The objective of this anatomical study was to perform the morphometry of dried lumbar vertebrae in human cadavers. Methods: This study utilized 200 adult human cadaveric dried lumbar vertebrae. The digital Vernier calipers was used to perform the measurements. The height, antero-posterior length, transverse length of the body of the vertebrae, interpedicular distance at the lateral ends, lamina length, height and thickness, superior and inferior articular facet height and width, mid sagittal and transverse diameter of vertebral foramen, height, width and thickness of the pars inter-articularis were measured. Results: The vertebral body’s anteroposterior length was more at the lower border than at the superior border (p < 0.01). The length of lamina was higher over the right in comparison to the left (p < 0.001). The height of lamina, width of inferior articular facet, diameter of lateral recess and thickness of pars inter-articularis were greater for the left sided specimens (p < 0.01). The statistical significance was not observed for the comparison of the remaining parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This anatomical study offered several dimensions of lumbar vertebrae, which are essential in the surgical practice. The implants at the lumbar vertebrae need to be manufactured based on the anatomical dimensions of that particular sample population.

                Background: Spontaneous remission (SR) has been reported in different hematological malignancies. It has been observed in adult T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is generally associated with recovery from an infectious or immunological process, and more recently possibly with clonal hematopoiesis. Case: We reviewed the literature and reported a new case of a 40 year-old man with a morphologic and cytogenetic diagnosis of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with an appendicular abscess. During his hospitalization and surgical management of his appendicitis, we noted SR of the rate of blast cells until cytological and cytogenetic remission of his ALL but unfortunately it did not last too long, moreover our patient relapsed after nine months, received intensive chemotherapy, underwent a placental blood allograft but relapsed again and died. Conclusions: In contrast to SR in other types of cancer, all documented cases of SR in ALL were only transient, so is there a need for early cytotoxic therapy in SR in ALL to delay relapse?

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of obesity on the outcome of total knee replacement (TKR) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this study was to look for the outcome of TKR in obese individuals.    Methods: The data of all patients who had undergone primary TKR between 2005 and 2015 were collected from the QuadruMed Patient Care System and crosschecked with the operating room.  The biometric data of age, gender, weight and postoperative follow up, any complications were collected from the medical charts. Patients were classified as per the BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is classified as per the WHO classification of 2000    Results Two hundred and four patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion.  The demographic data is given in Table 2. The average age 59.8±9.3 years. Right side was operated in 103 and left in 101 patients. The average BMI was 35.88±7.47 (Range 21.95-54.78); mean duration of surgery was 163.37±29.9 (Range 88-250) minutes. The range of follow up was 5-14 years with the average of 7.49±2.56 years. There were 18 (8.8%) complications. One hundred and three (50.5%) of the patients belonged to Class II Obesity (BMI ≥36Kg/M2). Between class II obesity and Class III obesity (BMI ≥41Kg/M2, the later had 94.4% of the complications. The level of satisfaction was similar in all the groups at 80%.  High BMI and longer duration of surgery were important and statistically significant risk factors (p <0.0001 and <0.009) for complications during TKA. Post operative data on VAS, Modified Knee Scoring Score and WOMAC grading, showing low scores of all the assessment in the patients with higher BMI.    Conclusions: Our analysis shows that our patients with Class III obesity had over 90% of the complications and we believe that patients in this BMI range should seek ways to reduce their body weight to avoid complications and long-term morbidity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differential gene expression during recall of behaviorally conditioned immune enhancement in rats: a pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods: Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results: In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions: Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                How do new ideas come about? The central hypothesis presented here states that insights might happen during mental navigation and correspond to rapid plasticity at the cellular level. We highlight the differences between neocortical and hippocampal mechanisms of insight. We argue that the suddenness of insight can be related to the sudden emergence of place fields in the hippocampus. According to our hypothesis, insights are supported by a state of mind-wandering that can be tied to the process of combining knowledge pieces during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs).

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Rational identification of potent and broad sarbecovirus-neutralizing antibody cocktails from SARS convalescents</a></h4>

              
                Cao et al. describe a strategy to identify broad sarbecovirus-neutralizing antibody cocktail that would be hard to escape for future SARS-CoV-2 variants using high-throughput epitope mapping. The resulting antibody cocktail named SA55+SA58 exhibits high neutralizing potency and breadth against ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses and efficiently protects mice from BA.1 and BA.5 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thymic macrophages consist of two populations with distinct localization and origin</a></h4>

              
                Tissue-resident macrophages are essential to protect from pathogen invasion and maintain organ homeostasis. The ability of thymic macrophages to engulf apoptotic thymocytes is well appreciated, but little is known about their ontogeny, maintenance, and diversity. Here, we characterized the surface phenotype and transcriptional profile of these cells and defined their expression signature. Thymic macrophages were most closely related to spleen red pulp macrophages and Kupffer cells and shared the expression of the transcription factor SpiC with these cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the macrophages in the adult thymus are composed of two populations distinguished by the expression of <i>Timd4</i> and <i>Cx3cr1</i>. Remarkably, <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> cells were located in the cortex, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were restricted to the medulla and the cortico-medullary junction. Using shield chimeras, transplantation of embryonic thymuses, and genetic fate mapping, we found that the two populations have distinct origins. <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> thymic macrophages are of embryonic origin, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages are derived from adult hematopoietic stem cells. Aging has a profound effect on the macrophages in the thymus. <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> cells underwent gradual attrition, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> cells slowly accumulated with age and, in older mice, were the dominant macrophage population in the thymus. Altogether, our work defines the phenotype, origin, and diversity of thymic macrophages.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Presynaptic contact and activity opposingly regulate postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth</a></h4>

              
                The organization of neural circuits determines nervous system function. Variability can arise during neural circuit development (e.g. neurite morphology, axon/dendrite position). To ensure robust nervous system function, mechanisms must exist to accommodate variation in neurite positioning during circuit formation. Previously we developed a model system in the <i>Drosophila</i> ventral nerve cord to conditionally induce positional variability of a proprioceptive sensory axon terminal, and used this model to show that when we altered the presynaptic position of the sensory neuron, its major postsynaptic interneuron partner modified its dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact, resulting in functional synaptic input (Sales et al., 2019). Here we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the interneuron dendrites detect and match variation in presynaptic partner location and input strength. We manipulate the presynaptic sensory neuron by (a) ablation; (b) silencing or activation; or (c) altering its location in the neuropil. From these experiments we conclude that there are two opposing mechanisms used to establish functional connectivity in the face of presynaptic variability: presynaptic contact stimulates dendrite outgrowth locally, whereas presynaptic activity inhibits postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth globally. These mechanisms are only active during an early larval critical period for structural plasticity. Collectively, our data provide new insights into dendrite development, identifying mechanisms that allow dendrites to flexibly respond to developmental variability in presynaptic location and input strength.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep proteome profiling reveals signatures of age and sex differences in paw skin and sciatic nerve of naïve mice</a></h4>

              
                The age and sex of studied animals profoundly impact experimental outcomes in biomedical research. However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 20 weeks and do not assess male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences, which are largely unknown at the molecular level in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerves (SCN) – two tissues implicated in nociception and pain as well as diseases linked to inflammation, injury, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing male and female mice at adolescent (4 weeks) and adult (14 weeks) age. Our analysis deciphered protein subsets and networks that were correlated with the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins/biological pathways with known (patho)physiological relevance, e.g., homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin, and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. Extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that various proteins associated with distinct skin diseases and pain exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique proteome resource that facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology, and integrates age and sex as biological variables – a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-throughput proteomics of nanogram-scale samples with Zeno SWATH MS</a></h4>

              
                The possibility to record proteomes in high throughput and at high quality has opened new avenues for biomedical research, drug discovery, systems biology, and clinical translation. However, high-throughput proteomic experiments often require high sample amounts and can be less sensitive compared to conventional proteomic experiments. Here, we introduce and benchmark Zeno SWATH MS, a data-independent acquisition technique that employs a linear ion trap pulsing (Zeno trap pulsing) to increase the sensitivity in high-throughput proteomic experiments. We demonstrate that when combined with fast micro- or analytical flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS increases protein identification with low sample amounts. For instance, using 20 min micro-flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS identified more than 5000 proteins consistently, and with a coefficient of variation of 6%, from a 62.5 ng load of human cell line tryptic digest. Using 5 min analytical flow-rate chromatography (800 µl/min), Zeno SWATH MS identified 4907 proteins from a triplicate injection of 2 µg of a human cell lysate, or more than 3000 proteins from a 250 ng tryptic digest. Zeno SWATH MS hence facilitates sensitive high-throughput proteomic experiments with low sample amounts, mitigating the current bottlenecks of high-throughput proteomics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spinosaurus is not an aquatic dinosaur</a></h4>

              
                A predominantly fish-eating diet was envisioned for the sail-backed theropod dinosaur <i>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus</i> when its elongate jaws with subconical teeth were unearthed a century ago in Egypt. Recent discovery of the high-spined tail of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was the first fully aquatic dinosaur. The ‘aquatic hypothesis’ posits that <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and flesh models of <i>S. aegyptiacus</i>. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a posable flesh model. That model shows that on land <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was bipedal and in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (&lt;1 m/s) too buoyant to dive. Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that <i>Spinosaurus</i> ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of <i>Spinosaurus</i>, which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An ER phospholipid hydrolase drives ER-associated mitochondrial constriction for fission and fusion</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo cycles of fission and fusion at a unified platform defined by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs). These MCSs or nodes co-localize fission and fusion machinery. We set out to identify how ER-associated mitochondrial nodes can regulate both fission and fusion machinery assembly. We have used a promiscuous biotin ligase linked to the fusion machinery, Mfn1, and proteomics to identify an ER membrane protein, ABHD16A, as a major regulator of node formation. In the absence of ABHD16A, fission and fusion machineries fail to recruit to ER-associated mitochondrial nodes and fission and fusion rates are significantly reduced. ABHD16A contains an acyltransferase motif and an α/β hydrolase domain and point mutations in critical residues of these regions fail to rescue the formation of ER-associated mitochondrial hot spots. These data suggest a mechanism whereby ABHD16A functions by altering phospholipid composition at ER-mitochondria MCSs. Our data present the first example of an ER membrane protein that regulates the recruitment of both fission and fusion machineries to mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oscillations support short latency co-firing of neurons during human episodic memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Theta and gamma oscillations in the medial temporal lobe are suggested to play a critical role for human memory formation via establishing synchrony in neural assemblies. Arguably, such synchrony facilitates efficient information transfer between neurons and enhances synaptic plasticity, both of which benefit episodic memory formation. However, to date little evidence exists from humans that would provide direct evidence for such a specific role of theta and gamma oscillations for episodic memory formation. Here we investigate how oscillations shape the temporal structure of neural firing during memory formation in the medial temporal lobe. We measured neural firing and local field potentials in human epilepsy patients via micro-wire electrode recordings to analyze whether brain oscillations are related to co-incidences of firing between neurons during successful and unsuccessful encoding of episodic memories. The results show that phase-coupling of neurons to faster theta and gamma oscillations correlates with co-firing at short latencies (~20-30 ms) and occurs during successful memory formation. Phase-coupling at slower oscillations in these same frequency bands, in contrast, correlates with longer co-firing latencies and occurs during memory failure. Thus, our findings suggest that neural oscillations play a role for the synchronization of neural firing in the medial temporal lobe during the encoding of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Despite impaired binocular function, binocular disparity integration across the visual field is spared in normal aging and glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To examine how binocularly asymmetric glaucomatous visual field damage affects processing of binocular disparity across the visual field. Design: Case-control study. Participants and Controls: A sample of 18 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, 16 age-matched controls, and 13 young controls. Methods: Participants underwent standard clinical assessments of binocular visual acuity, binocular contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity, and perimetry. We employed a previously validated psychophysical procedure to measure how sensitivity to binocular disparity varied across spatial frequencies and visual field sectors, i.e. with full-field stimuli spanning the central 21{degrees} of the visual field, and with stimuli restricted to annular regions spanning 0{degrees}-3{degrees}, 3{degrees}-9{degrees} or 9{degrees}-21{degrees}. Main Outcome Measures: We verified the presence of binocularly asymmetric glaucomatous visual field damage by comparing--between the two eyes--the mean deviation values obtained from the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24-2 test. To assess the spatial-frequency tuning of disparity sensitivity across the visual field of patients and controls, we fit disparity sensitivity data to log-parabola models and compared fitted model parameters. Lastly, we employed disparity sensitivity measurements from restricted visual field conditions to model different possible scenarios regarding how disparity information is combined across visual field sectors. We adjudicated between the potential mechanisms by comparing model predictions to the observed patterns of disparity sensitivity with full-field stimuli. Results: The interocular difference in HFA 24-2 mean deviation was greater in glaucoma patients compared to both young and age-matched controls (ps=.01). Across participant groups foveal regions preferentially processed disparities at finer spatial scales, whereas periphery regions were tuned for coarser scales (p<.001). Disparity sensitivity also decreased from the fovea to the periphery (p<.001) and across participant groups (ps<.01). Finally, similar to controls, glaucoma patients exhibited near-optimal disparity integration, specifically at low spatial frequencies (p<.001). Conclusions: Contrary to the conventional view that glaucoma spares central vision, we find that glaucomatous damage causes a widespread loss of disparity sensitivity across both foveal and peripheral regions. Despite these losses, cortical integration mechanisms appear to be well preserved, suggesting that glaucoma patients make the best possible use of their remaining binocular function.

	<p>Background: The number of elderly diabetic patients has been increasing recently, and these patients have a higher morbidity of dementia than those without diabetes. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for the development of dementia in elderly individuals, which is a serious health problem. Objectives: The primary aim was to examine whether diabetes is a risk factor for dementia among elderly individuals. The secondary aim was to apply grey theory to integrate the results and how they relate to cognitive impairments in elderly diabetic patients and to predict which participants are at high risk of developing dementia. Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients aged 50 years or older who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were recruited. Information on demographics, disease characteristics, activities of daily living, Mini Mental State Examination, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life was collected via questionnaires. The grey relational analysis approach was applied to evaluate the relationship between the results and health outcomes. Results: A total of 13.6% of participants had cognitive disturbances, of whom 1.4% had severe cognitive dysfunction. However, with regard to sleep disorders, 56.4% had sleep disturbances of varying degrees from light to severe. Further investigation is needed to address this problem. A higher prevalence of sleep disturbances among diabetic patients translates to a higher degree of depressive symptoms and a worse physical and mental health-related quality of life. Furthermore, based on the grey relational analysis, the grey relation coefficient varies from 0.6217~0.7540. Among the subjects, Participant 101 had the highest value, suggesting a need for immediate medical care. In this study, we observed that 20% of the total participants, for whom the grey relation coefficient was 0.6730, needed further and immediate medical care.</p>

	<p>Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL; Haberland syndrome, #613001) is an extremely rare congenital disorder that is manifested by the involvement of the skin, eyes and central nervous system (CNS). We report two cases of children with ECCL diagnosis. First was an 8-year-old girl who presented with symptomatic epilepsy, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. In 2020, she was admitted to the hospital due to the exacerbation of paresis and intensified prolonged epileptic seizures, provoked by infection of the middle ear. Diagnostic imaging revealed radiological changes suggestive of ECCL, providing a reason for the diagnosis, despite the lack of skin and eye anomalies. The second child, a 14-year-old girl, was consulted for subtle clinical signs and epilepsy suspicion. Diagnostic imaging findings were similar, though less pronounced. Based on neuroradiological abnormalities typical for Haberland syndrome, the authors discuss possible ECCL diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances have a negative impact on attention. However, how it affects attention and whether the restoration of regular rhythms can restore attention are unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances on three subfunctions of attention (alertness, orientation, and executive control) and the restoration of regular rhythms on these functions. Twenty-one participants in the experimental group (who experienced sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances for at least one month; aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;26) were required to sleep regularly following a sleep schedule, whereas 20 participants in the control group (who maintained regular sleep for at least three months; aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;22) received no manipulation of their sleep. All participants were assessed using the attention network test three times in six days. All of them wore spectrum activity monitors and kept sleep diaries every day. The results showed that the effects of alertness and executive control in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group. After five days of regular sleep, the difference in the alertness effect between the two groups significantly decreased. These results suggested that under natural conditions, sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances could negatively influence alertness and executive control, and a short period of restoring a regular rhythm has a recovery effect on alertness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Developmental Progression of Eight Opsin Spectral Signals Recorded from the Zebrafish Retinal Cone Layer Is Altered by the Timing and Cell Type Expression of Thyroxin Receptor {beta}2 (tr{beta}2) Gain-Of-Function Transgenes</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Zebrafish retinal cone signals shift in spectral shape through larval, juvenile, and adult development as expression patterns of eight cone-opsin genes change. An algorithm extracting signal amplitudes for the component cone spectral types is developed and tested on two thyroxin receptor &beta;2 (tr&beta;2) gain-of-function lines <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> and <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I>, allowing correlation between opsin signaling and opsin immunoreactivity in lines with different developmental timing and cell-type expression of this red-opsin-promoting transgene. Both adult transgenics became complete, or nearly complete, "red-cone dichromats," with disproportionately large long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS)1 opsin amplitudes as compared with controls, where LWS1 and LWS2 amplitudes were about equal, and significant signals from SWS1, SWS2, and Rh2 opsins were detected. But in transgenic larvae and juveniles of both lines it was LWS2 amplitudes that increased, with LWS1 cone signals rarely encountered. In <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos at 5 d postfertilization (dpf), red-opsin immunoreactive cone density doubled, but red-opsin amplitudes (LWS2) increased &lt;10%, and green-opsin, blue-opsin, and UV-opsin signals were unchanged, despite co-expressed red opsins, and the finding that an <I>sws1</I> UV-opsin reporter gene was shut down by the <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> transgene. By contrast both LWS2 red-cone amplitudes and the density of red-cone immunoreactivity more than doubled in 5-dpf <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos, while UV-cone amplitudes were reduced 90%. Embryonic cones with tr&beta;2 gain-of-function transgenes were morphologically distinct from control red, blue or UV cones, with wider inner segments and shorter axons than red cones, suggesting cone spectral specification, opsin immunoreactivity and shape are influenced by the abundance and developmental timing of tr&beta;2 expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Noninvasive Method for Monitoring Breathing Patterns in Nonhuman Primates Using a Nasal Thermosensor</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Respiration is strongly linked to internal states such as arousal, emotion, and even cognitive processes and provides objective biological information to estimate these states in humans and animals. However, the measurement of respiration has not been established in macaque monkeys, which have been widely used as model animals for understanding various higher brain functions. In the present study, we developed a method to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys. We first measured the temperature of their nasal breathing, which changes between inspiration and expiration phases, in an anesthetized condition and estimated the respiration pattern. We compared the estimated pattern with that obtained by a conventional chest band method that has been used in humans and applied to anesthetized, but not behaving, monkeys. These respiration patterns matched well, suggesting that the measurement of nasal air temperature can be used to monitor the respiration of monkeys. Furthermore, we confirmed that the respiration frequency in behaving monkeys monitored by the measurement of nasal air temperature was not affected by the orofacial movement of licking to obtain the liquid reward. We next examined the frequency of respiration when they listened to music or white noise. The respiratory frequency was higher when the monkeys listened to music than the noise. This result is consistent with a phenomenon in humans and indicates the accuracy of our monitoring method. These data suggest that the measurement of nasal air temperature enables us to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys and thereby estimate their internal states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Fast Synaptically Activated Calcium and Sodium Kinetics in Hippocampal Pyramidal Neuron Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>An accurate assessment of the time course, components, and magnitude of postsynaptic currents is important for a quantitative understanding of synaptic integration and signaling in dendritic spines. These parameters have been studied in some detail in previous experiments, primarily using two-photon imaging of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate. However, even with these revolutionary techniques, there are some missing pieces in our current understanding, particularly related to the time courses of synaptically evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes. In new experiments, we used low-affinity, linear Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, laser fluorescence stimulation, and a sensitive camera-based detection system, combined with electrical stimulation and two-photon glutamate uncaging, to extend measurements of these spine parameters. We found that (1) almost all synaptically activated Na<sup>+</sup> currents in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron spines in slices from mice of either sex are through AMPA receptors with little Na<sup>+</sup> entry through voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) or NMDA receptor channels; (2) a spectrum of sodium transient decay times was observed, suggesting a spectrum of spine neck resistances, even on the same dendrite; (3) synaptically activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes are very fast and are almost entirely because of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through NMDA receptors at the time when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block is relieved by the fast AMPA-mediated EPSP; (4) the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes evoked by uncaging glutamate are slower than the changes evoked by synaptic release, suggesting that the relative contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through NMDA receptors at rest following uncaging is higher than following electrical stimulation.</p>

                Background: Psychosocial research in humanitarian settings has been historically dominated by a focus on distress and disorder. As such, there is a need to establish the validity of instruments for a broad range of psychosocial outcomes, particularly among highly affected and under-represented populations. The current study describes the adaptation and testing of multiple psychosocial instruments among displaced Rohingya mothers in Bangladesh.  Methods: We used baseline data from 600 mothers of malnourished children aged 2 and under enrolled in an intervention study in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Instruments assessed distress (International Depression Symptom Scale [IDSS] and Kessler-6 [K-6]); functional impairment (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]); subjective wellbeing (global Satisfaction With Life [SWL] and Personal Wellbeing Index [PWI];  and, coping (Brief COPE and locally developed coping items). Instruments were piloted and refined, then used for data collection by Bangladeshi-Rohingya interviewer pairs. We conducted exploratory factor analysis, evaluated internal consistency, examined construct validity through correlation with other scales, and used regression models to explore demographic factors associated with psychosocial health.  Results: Both the WHODAS and coping items fit 2-factor models; other scales were unidimensional. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .76 to .90 for the refined scales. With the exception of coping, scale correlations supported construct validity; separate measures of the same construct were highly correlated, distress and impairment were moderately correlated, and both were inversely correlated with wellbeing. Correlates of poorer psychosocial health included relative socioeconomic disadvantage, current pregnancy, and being unmarried.   Conclusions: Most of the standard psychosocial assessment tools performed adequately, but they did not appear to fully capture local experiences and included items of little local relevance. Findings highlight the need for further mixed methods research to develop a rich battery of instruments with cross-cultural validity, particularly for positive outcomes such as coping which was particularly challenging to assess.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular survey of certain protozoan agents that cause diarrhea in children in Sudan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in third world countries; identification of causative agents of diarrhea is essential to apply measures to prevent and control this disease. In addition, scant data are available regarding childhood diarrhea in Sudan. Our research aimed to determine the incidence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entameobia histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and Gardia lambelia) among the young (aged less than five years) in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a parasitological cross-sectional survey, and stool samples from 437 patients were examined for E. histolytica, C.  parvum, and G. lambelia using a multiplex real-time PCR method. Results Of the 437 stool samples tested, infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was identified in 16 (3.7%) cases. G. lambelia (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.5%). The highest and lowest rates of parasitic infections were seen in the less than two years age group (32.7%), and in the 2–4-year-old group (2.7%), the male children showed higher rates of infections (23.7%) compared to females (11.7%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher (37.7%) in the rainy season (August to December) (32.7%) in contrast with that (2.7%) in the dry season (April to June). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of G. lambelia and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in Khartoum State and the multiplex real-time technique's usefulness in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil- ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Developing dispute resolution policy for conflicts settlement in public-private partnership (PPP) projects in educational institutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) advocates a 15-20% allocation of the developing nations’ annual budget to educational development, but the available resources are not adequate to support the sector in the global south. Thus, University Hostel Development and Management (UHDM) policy was selected to attract private investors for the provision of educational facilities in Nigerian public universities. The policy considered a public-private partnership (PPP) model to ameliorate the menace of dilapidated infrastructures. Initially, there was massive investors’ participation until contractual disputes started to undermine the success recorded. Therefore, incessant disputes without resourceful resolutions motivate the need to examine this policy and spot the gaps for necessary improvement. Policy: The National Universities Commission (NUC) augments the provision of infrastructure in Nigerian public universities through the UHDM initiative in 2004. Conflicts owing to the multiplicity of stakeholders’ contrasting interests overwhelmed the initiative. Many value-added projects were terminated. The poor condition of facilities lingers to serve as a basic factor for half-baked graduates, low employee productivity and declined socio-economic values of the nation. This brief focuses on the role of formal dispute resolution mechanisms (DRMs) for conflict management in PPP arrangements. By observation, stakeholders rarely envisage potential conflicts, thus, no contemplation of specific DRMs adoption despite the inevitability of contractual disputes. Recommendations: This brief recommends the inclusion of the dispute resolution policy in the PPP Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Recommendations are hereby generated from the analysis of the stakeholders’ opinions on the causes of the dispute, conflict prevention strategies, and the relevant dispute resolution mechanisms peculiar to the PPP contracts in educational institutions. Also, ambiguities in the policy that bordered on an inexplicit institutional framework, lack of PPP experts’ involvement, imperfect contract agreement, and deficiency of feasibility study, are resolved by the recommendations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sampling effects and measurement overlap can bias the inference of neuronal avalanches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Pinheiro Neto, F. Paul Spitzner, Viola Priesemann</p>

To date, it is still impossible to sample the entire mammalian brain with single-neuron precision. This forces one to either use spikes (focusing on few neurons) or to use coarse-sampled activity (averaging over many neurons, e.g. LFP). Naturally, the sampling technique impacts inference about collective properties. Here, we emulate both sampling techniques on a simple spiking model to quantify how they alter observed correlations and signatures of criticality. We describe a general effect: when the inter-electrode distance is small, electrodes sample overlapping regions in space, which increases the correlation between the signals. For coarse-sampled activity, this can produce power-law distributions even for non-critical systems. In contrast, spike recordings do not suffer this particular bias and underlying dynamics can be identified. This may resolve why coarse measures and spikes have produced contradicting results in the past.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Small predators dominate fish predation in coral reef communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michalis Mihalitsis, Renato A. Morais, David R. Bellwood</p>

Ecosystem processes are challenging to quantify at a community level, particularly within complex ecosystems (e.g., rainforests, coral reefs). Predation is one of the most important types of species interactions, determining several ecosystem processes. However, while it is widely recognised, it is rarely quantified, especially in aquatic systems. To address these issues, we model predation on fish by fish, in a hyperdiverse coral reef community. We show that body sizes previously examined in fish–fish predation studies (based on a metanalysis), only represent about 5% of likely predation events. The average fish predator on coral reefs is just 3.65 cm; the average fish prey just 1.5 cm. These results call for a shift in the way we view fish predation and its ability to shape the species or functional composition of coral reef fish communities. Considered from a functional group approach, we found general agreement in the distribution of simulated and observed predation events, among both predator and prey functional groups. Predation on coral reefs is a process driven by small fish, most of which are neither seen nor quantified.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Bats expand their vocal range by recruiting different laryngeal structures for echolocation and social communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonas Håkansson, Cathrine Mikkelsen, Lasse Jakobsen, Coen P. H. Elemans</p>

Echolocating bats produce very diverse vocal signals for echolocation and social communication that span an impressive frequency range of 1 to 120 kHz or 7 octaves. This tremendous vocal range is unparalleled in mammalian sound production and thought to be produced by specialized laryngeal vocal membranes on top of vocal folds. However, their function in vocal production remains untested. By filming vocal membranes in excised bat larynges (<i>Myotis daubentonii</i>) in vitro with ultra-high-speed video (up to 250,000 fps) and using deep learning networks to extract their motion, we provide the first direct observations that vocal membranes exhibit flow-induced self-sustained vibrations to produce 10 to 95 kHz echolocation and social communication calls in bats. The vocal membranes achieve the highest fundamental frequencies (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub><i>’s</i>) of any mammal, but their vocal range is with 3 to 4 octaves comparable to most mammals. We evaluate the currently outstanding hypotheses for vocal membrane function and propose that most laryngeal adaptations in echolocating bats result from selection for producing high-frequency, rapid echolocation calls to catch fast-moving prey. Furthermore, we show that bats extend their lower vocal range by recruiting their ventricular folds—as in death metal growls—that vibrate at distinctly lower frequencies of 1 to 5 kHz for producing agonistic social calls. The different selection pressures for echolocation and social communication facilitated the evolution of separate laryngeal structures that together vastly expanded the vocal range in bats.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative analysis reveals the long-term coevolutionary history of parvoviruses and vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew A. Campbell, Shannon Loncar, Robert M. Kotin, Robert J. Gifford</p>

Parvoviruses (family <i>Parvoviridae</i>) are small DNA viruses that cause numerous diseases of medical, veterinary, and agricultural significance and have important applications in gene and anticancer therapy. DNA sequences derived from ancient parvoviruses are common in animal genomes and analysis of these <i>endogenous parvoviral elements</i> (EPVs) has demonstrated that the family, which includes twelve vertebrate-specific genera, arose in the distant evolutionary past. So far, however, such “paleovirological” analysis has only provided glimpses into the biology of ancient parvoviruses and their long-term evolutionary interactions with hosts. Here, we comprehensively map EPV diversity in 752 published vertebrate genomes, revealing defining aspects of ecology and evolution within individual parvovirus genera. We identify 364 distinct EPV sequences and show these represent approximately 200 unique germline incorporation events, involving at least five distinct parvovirus genera, which took place at points throughout the Cenozoic Era. We use the spatiotemporal and host range calibrations provided by these sequences to infer defining aspects of long-term evolution within individual parvovirus genera, including mammalian vicariance for genus <i>Protoparvovirus</i>, and interclass transmission for genus <i>Dependoparvovirus</i>. Moreover, our findings support a model of virus evolution in which the long-term cocirculation of multiple parvovirus genera in vertebrates reflects the adaptation of each viral genus to fill a distinct ecological niche. Our findings show that efforts to develop parvoviruses as therapeutic tools can be approached from a rational foundation based on comparative evolutionary analysis. To support this, we published our data in the form of an open, extensible, and cross-platform database designed to facilitate the wider utilisation of evolution-related domain knowledge in parvovirus research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Increasing plant group productivity through latent genetic variation for cooperation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel E. Wuest, Nuno D. Pires, Shan Luo, Francois Vasseur, Julie Messier, Ueli Grossniklaus, Pascal A. Niklaus</p>

Historic yield advances in the major crops have, to a large extent, been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on “cooperative” traits (e.g., erect leaves, short stems) that—while beneficial to the group—decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because “selfish” traits will be selected for and reduce yield in high-density monocultures. One approach, therefore, has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation benefit the monoculture group but are disadvantageous to the individual when facing noncooperative neighbors. Testing the approach using the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable except under special circumstances, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for cooperation in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could rapidly be leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A hospital-based prospective cohort study to assess the factors associated with transmission dynamics of SARS CoV-2 among healthcare workers in Delhi [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare personnel providing COVID-19 care are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Understanding the factors associated with the transmission of infection among healthcare workers provides input for the development of prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were to study the adherence to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures followed between different categories of healthcare workers, to estimate seroconversion rate based on the type of exposure with COVID-19 patients, and to study the association between seroconversion and IPC practices. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 among the healthcare workers in two tertiary healthcare institutes selected by purposive sampling. All Healthcare workers (HCWs) participating in the clinical management or having any exposure to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were included. A total of 817 subjects were enrolled in the study. At baseline, details on IPC training and adherence along with details of the type of exposure with the COVID-19 patient were collected. The end-line visit was scheduled at 22-31 (preferably 28 days) days from the first visit for the collection of the symptom diary and end-line form.  Results: Hand hygiene practices were found to be best among paramedics (98.0%), followed by doctors (84.5%) and nurses (90.1%). Maximum HCWs (99.5%; 99.8%; 97.1%) reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appropriately and regular availability of PPE in the hospital setting. Among the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest proportion (28.7%) of untrained personnel. Conclusion: The HCWs who had contact with the surroundings of an infected patient showed higher odds of seroconversion although not statistically significant. Further, analyzing the types of PPE used, we found that the use of masks and gloves was protective in preventing infection. Strengthening IPC training through refresher training and demonstrating the correct use of PPE can enhance adherence to IPC measures.
