              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain aerobic glycolysis and resilience in Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                The distribution of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG) in normal young adults correlates spatially with amyloid-beta deposition in individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and asymptomatic individuals with brain amyloid deposition. Brain AG decreases with age but the functional significance of this decrease with regard to the development of DAT symptomatology is poorly understood. Using PET measurements of regional blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization, from which we derive AG, we find that cognitive impairment is strongly associated with loss of the typical youthful pattern of AG. In contrast, amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment was associated with preservation of youthful brain AG, which was even higher than that seen in typical, cognitively unimpaired, amyloid negative adults. Similar findings were not seen for blood flow nor oxygen consumption. Finally, in cognitively unimpaired adults, white matter hyperintensity burden was found to be specifically associated with decreased youthful brain AG. Our results implicate preserved AG as a factor in brain resilience to amyloid pathology and suggest that white matter disease may be a cause and/or consequence of this impaired resilience.

	<p>&amp;amp;Delta;9-Tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and cannabidiol is purportedly responsible for many of the medicinal benefits. The effects of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in younger populations have been well studied; however, motor function, cognitive function, and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults have not been extensively researched. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in cognitive function, motor function, and cerebral glucose metabolism (assessed via [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) in older adults chronically using &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and non-using controls. Eight &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users (59.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 years), five cannabidiol users (54.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 years), and 16 non-users (58.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.9 years) participated. Subjects underwent resting scans and performed cognitive testing (reaction time, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test), motor testing (hand/arm function, gait), and balance testing. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users performed worse than both cannabidiol users and non-users on the Flanker Test but were similar on all other cognitive and motor tasks. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users also had lower global metabolism and relative hypermetabolism in the bilateral amygdala, cerebellum, and brainstem. Chronic use of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol in older adults might negatively influence inhibitory control and alter brain activity. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes investigating multiple &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol ratios on functional outcomes and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults are necessary.</p>

	<p>Silent speech decoding (SSD), based on articulatory neuromuscular activities, has become a prevalent task of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) in recent years. Many works have been devoted to decoding surface electromyography (sEMG) from articulatory neuromuscular activities. However, restoring silent speech in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese is still difficult. This paper proposes an optimized sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach to synthesize voice from the sEMG-based silent speech. We extract duration information to regulate the sEMG-based silent speech using the audio length. Then, we provide a deep-learning model with an encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure and a state-of-the-art vocoder to generate the audio waveform. Experiments based on six Mandarin Chinese speakers demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully decode silent speech in Mandarin Chinese and achieve a character error rate (CER) of 6.41% on average with human evaluation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Thalamocortical Projections Are Significantly Impaired in the R6/2 Mouse Model of Huntingtons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>As Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) progresses, there is a significant loss of neurons in the striatum in addition to a distinct thinning of the cerebral cortex. Despite an early presence of sensorimotor deficits in patients with HD, electrophysiological studies designed to assess the integrity of thalamocortical circuits are sparse. Using the R6/2 mouse model of HD, we provide evidence of reduced connectivity between thalamic cells and their targeted cortical regions. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ventral anterolateral nucleus (VAL; motor) and ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM; somatosensory) thalamic neurons in <I>ex vivo</I> brain slices of R6/2 and wild-type (WT) mice revealed that cells in both thalamic nuclei of R6/2 mice exhibited significant differences in passive and active cell membrane properties (smaller cell membrane capacitances, faster decay time constants and increased input resistances) compared with WT cells. Although only cells in the VPM of symptomatic R6/2 mice had more depolarized resting membrane potentials compared with WTs, cells in both nuclei displayed increased excitability in symptomatic, but not presymptomatic, R6/2 mice. Optical activation of VAL and VPM terminals elicited smaller magnitude current responses in cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) in both motor cortex (M1CTX) and somatosensory barrel cortex (BCTX) of symptomatic R6/2 mice compared with CPNs in WT mice. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the frequency of thalamocortical excitatory quantal events in R6/2 BCTX CPNs, with no genotype-dependent differences in AMPA:NMDA response amplitude ratios. These data suggest there is a decrease in the transmission of thalamocortical information that is likely because of impaired neurotransmitter release.</p>

<p>Neuroscience is not just for neuroscientists. It is for everyone, but it is absent from our high schools. High schools have a huge investment in STEM but do not include neuroscience, although neuroscience is more interesting and relevant to a person&rsquo;s daily life than most other sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Attention Cueing in Rivalry: Insights from Pupillometry</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size modulations (~0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These pupil responses were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil modulations during exclusive dominance phases. This was observed despite the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by ~10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial Tmem59 Deficiency Impairs Phagocytosis of Synapse and Leads to Autism-Like Behaviors in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic abnormality is an important pathologic feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and responsible for various behavioral defects in these neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia are the major immune cells in the brain and also play an important role in synapse refinement. Although dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during the brain development has been associated with ASDs, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observed that expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), a protein recently shown to regulate microglial function, was decreased in autistic patients. Furthermore, we found that both male and female mice with either complete or microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I> developed ASD-like behaviors. Microglial TMEM59-deficient mice also exhibited enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, increased dendritic spine density, and elevated levels of excitatory synaptic proteins in synaptosomes. TMEM59-deficient microglia had impaired capacity for synapse engulfment both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Moreover, we demonstrated that TMEM59 interacted with the C1q receptor CD93 and TMEM59 deficiency promoted CD93 protein degradation in microglia. Downregulation of CD93 in microglia also impaired synapse engulfment. These findings identify a crucial role of TMEM59 in modulating microglial function on synapse refinement during brain development and suggest that TMEM59 deficiency may contribute to ASDs through disrupting phagocytosis of excitatory synapse and thus distorting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) neuronal activity balance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia play an important role in synapse refinement. Dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during brain development has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observe that the expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), an autophagy-related protein, is decreased in autistic patients. Moreover, we find ASD-like behaviors in mice with complete loss and with microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I>. Mechanistic studies reveal that TMEM59 deficiency in microglia impairs their synapse engulfment ability likely through destabilizing the C1q receptor CD93, thereby leading to enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and increased dendritic spine density. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of microglial TMEM59 in early neuronal development and provide new insight into the etiology of ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Voltage-Gated K+ Channels and K2P Channels in Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties and Saltatory Conduction at Nodes of Ranvier of Rat Lumbar Spinal Ventral Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) are believed to play essential roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction of action potentials (AP) at the NRs of myelinated nerves. While we have recently shown that two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a key role at the NRs of A&beta;-afferent nerves, K<sup>+</sup> channels and their functions at the NRs of mammalian motor nerves remain elusive. Here we addressed this issue by using <I>ex vivo</I> preparations of lumbar spinal ventral nerves from both male and female rats and the pressure-patch-clamp recordings at their NRs. We found that depolarizing voltages evoked large noninactivating outward currents at NRs. The outward currents could be partially inhibited by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, largely inhibited by K2P blockers and cooling temperatures. Inhibition of the outward currents by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, K2P blockers, or cooling temperatures significantly altered electrophysiological properties measured at the NRs, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP width, AP amplitude, AP threshold, and AP rheobase. Furthermore, K2P blockers and cooling temperatures significantly reduced saltatory conduction velocity and success rates of APs in response to high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers reduced AP success rates at high-frequency stimulation without significantly affecting saltatory conduction velocity. Collectively, both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve fibers of rats. The effects of cooling temperatures on saltatory conduction are at least partially mediated by K2P channels at the NRs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ion channels localized at the NRs are believed to be key determinants of saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves. However, ion channels and their functions at the NRs have not been fully studied in different types of mammalian myelinated nerves. Here we use the pressure-patch-clamp recordings to show that both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of lumbar spinal ventral nerves of rats. Furthermore, cooling temperatures exert effects on saltatory conduction via inhibition of ion channels at the NRs. Our results provide new insights into saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves and may have physiological as well as pathologic implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Understanding the Influence of Target Acquisition on Survival, Integration, and Phenotypic Maturation of Dopamine Neurons within Stem Cell-Derived Neural Grafts in a Parkinson's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons include many subtypes characterized by their location, connectivity and function. Surprisingly, mechanisms underpinning the specification of A9 neurons [responsible for motor function, including within ventral midbrain (VM) grafts for treating Parkinson's disease (PD)] over adjacent A10, remains largely speculated. We assessed the impact of synaptic targeting on survival, integration, and phenotype acquisition of dopaminergic neurons within VM grafts generated from fetal tissue or human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). VM progenitors were grafted into female mice with 6OHDA-lesions of host midbrain dopamine neurons, with some animals also receiving intrastriatal quinolinic acid (QA) injections to ablate medium spiny neurons (MSN), the A9 neuron primary target. While loss of MSNs variably affected graft survival, it significantly reduced striatal yet increased cortical innervation. Consequently, grafts showed reduced A9 and increased A10 specification, with more DA neurons failing to mature into either subtype. These findings highlight the importance of target acquisition on DA subtype specification during development and repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parish and colleagues highlight, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD), the importance of synaptic target acquisition in the survival, integration and phenotypic specification of grafted dopamine neurons derived from fetal tissue and human stem cells. Ablation of host striatal neurons resulted in reduced dopamine neuron survival within grafts, re-routing of dopamine fibers from striatal to alternate cortical targets and a consequential reduced specification of A9 dopamine neurons (the subpopulation critical for restoration of motor function) and increase in A10 DA neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learned Motor Patterns Are Replayed in Human Motor Cortex during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consolidation of memory is believed to involve offline replay of neural activity. While amply demonstrated in rodents, evidence for replay in humans, particularly regarding motor memory, is less compelling. To determine whether replay occurs after motor learning, we sought to record from motor cortex during a novel motor task and subsequent overnight sleep. A 36-year-old man with tetraplegia secondary to cervical spinal cord injury enrolled in the ongoing BrainGate brain&ndash;computer interface pilot clinical trial had two 96-channel intracortical microelectrode arrays placed chronically into left precentral gyrus. Single- and multi-unit activity was recorded while he played a color/sound sequence matching memory game. Intended movements were decoded from motor cortical neuronal activity by a real-time steady-state Kalman filter that allowed the participant to control a neurally driven cursor on the screen. Intracortical neural activity from precentral gyrus and 2-lead scalp EEG were recorded overnight as he slept. When decoded using the same steady-state Kalman filter parameters, intracortical neural signals recorded overnight replayed the target sequence from the memory game at intervals throughout at a frequency significantly greater than expected by chance. Replay events occurred at speeds ranging from 1 to 4 times as fast as initial task execution and were most frequently observed during slow-wave sleep. These results demonstrate that recent visuomotor skill acquisition in humans may be accompanied by replay of the corresponding motor cortex neural activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within cortex, the acquisition of information is often followed by the offline recapitulation of specific sequences of neural firing. Replay of recent activity is enriched during sleep and may support the consolidation of learning and memory. Using an intracortical brain&ndash;computer interface, we recorded and decoded activity from motor cortex as a human research participant performed a novel motor task. By decoding neural activity throughout subsequent sleep, we find that neural sequences underlying the recently practiced motor task are repeated throughout the night, providing direct evidence of replay in human motor cortex during sleep. This approach, using an optimized brain&ndash;computer interface decoder to characterize neural activity during sleep, provides a framework for future studies exploring replay, learning, and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Whole-Brain Wiring Diagram of Oxytocin System in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological responses via direct connections with different neural circuits. However, the lack of comprehensive input-output wiring diagrams of Oxt neurons and their quantitative relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression presents challenges to understanding circuit-specific Oxt functions. Here, we establish a whole-brain distribution and anatomic connectivity map of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxtr expression using high-resolution 3D mapping methods in adult male and female mice. We use a flatmap to describe Oxt neuronal expression in four hypothalamic domains including under-characterized Oxt neurons in the tuberal nucleus (TU). Oxt neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) broadly project to nine functional circuits that control cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. In contrast, Oxt neurons in the supraoptic (SO) and accessory (AN) nuclei have limited central projection to a small subset of the nine circuits. Surprisingly, quantitative comparison between Oxt output and Oxtr expression showed no significant correlation across the whole brain, suggesting abundant indirect Oxt signaling in Oxtr-expressing areas. Unlike output, Oxt neurons in both the PVH and SO receive similar monosynaptic inputs from a subset of the nine circuits mainly in the thalamic, hypothalamic, and cerebral nuclei areas. Our results suggest that PVH-Oxt neurons serve as a central modulator to integrate external and internal information via largely reciprocal connection with the nine circuits while the SO-Oxt neurons act mainly as unidirectional Oxt hormonal output. In summary, our Oxt wiring diagram provides anatomic insights about distinct behavioral functions of Oxt signaling in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological functions from prosocial behavior to pain sensation via central projection in the brain. Thus, understanding detailed anatomic connectivity of Oxt neurons can provide insight on circuit-specific roles of Oxt signaling in regulating different physiological functions. Here, we use high-resolution mapping methods to describe the 3D distribution, monosynaptic input and long-range output of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression across the entire mouse brain. We found Oxt connections with nine functional circuits controlling cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. Furthermore, we identified a quantitatively unmatched Oxt-Oxtr relationship, suggesting broad indirect Oxt signaling. Together, our comprehensive Oxt wiring diagram advances our understanding of circuit-specific roles of Oxt neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gamma Activation and Alpha Suppression within Human Auditory Cortex during a Speech Classification Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dynamics of information flow within the auditory cortical hierarchy associated with speech processing and the emergence of hemispheric specialization remain incompletely understood. To study these questions with high spatiotemporal resolution, intracranial recordings in 29 human neurosurgical patients of both sexes were obtained while subjects performed a semantic classification task. Neural activity was recorded from posteromedial portion of Heschl's gyrus (HGPM) and anterolateral portion of Heschl's gyrus (HGAL), planum temporale (PT), planum polare, insula, and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Responses to monosyllabic words exhibited early gamma power increases and a later suppression of alpha power, envisioned to represent feedforward activity and decreased feedback signaling, respectively. Gamma activation and alpha suppression had distinct magnitude and latency profiles. HGPM and PT had the strongest gamma responses with shortest onset latencies, indicating that they are the earliest auditory cortical processing stages. The origin of attenuated top-down influences in auditory cortex, as indexed by alpha suppression, was in STG and HGAL. Gamma responses and alpha suppression were typically larger to nontarget words than tones. Alpha suppression was uniformly greater to target versus nontarget stimuli. Hemispheric bias for words versus tones and for target versus nontarget words, when present, was left lateralized. Better task performance was associated with increased gamma activity in the left PT and greater alpha suppression in HGPM and HGAL bilaterally. The prominence of alpha suppression during semantic classification and its accessibility for noninvasive electrophysiologic studies suggests that this measure is a promising index of auditory cortical speech processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the dynamics of cortical speech processing requires the use of active tasks. This is the first comprehensive intracranial electroencephalography study to examine cortical activity within the superior temporal plane, lateral superior temporal gyrus, and the insula during a semantic classification task. Distinct gamma activation and alpha suppression profiles clarify the functional organization of feedforward and feedback processing within the auditory cortical hierarchy. Asymmetries in cortical speech processing emerge at early processing stages. Relationships between cortical activity and task performance are interpreted in the context of current models of speech processing. Results lay the groundwork for iEEG studies using connectivity measures of the bidirectional information flow within the auditory processing hierarchy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Striatal Activity Characterizes Human Safety Learning via Pavlovian Conditioned Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Safety learning generates associative links between neutral stimuli and the absence of threat, promoting the inhibition of fear and security-seeking behaviors. Precisely how safety learning is mediated at the level of underlying brain systems, particularly in humans, remains unclear. Here, we integrated a novel Pavlovian conditioned inhibition task with ultra-high field (7 Tesla) fMRI to examine the neural basis of safety learning in 49 healthy participants. In our task, participants were conditioned to two safety signals: a conditioned inhibitor that predicted threat omission when paired with a known threat signal (A+/AX-), and a standard safety signal that generally predicted threat omission (BC-). Both safety signals evoked equivalent autonomic and subjective learning responses but diverged strongly in terms of underlying brain activation (<I>P</I><SUB>FDR</SUB> whole-brain corrected). The conditioned inhibitor was characterized by more prominent activation of the dorsal striatum, anterior insular, and dorsolateral PFC compared with the standard safety signal, whereas the latter evoked greater activation of the ventromedial PFC, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus, among other regions. Further analyses of the conditioned inhibitor indicated that its initial learning was characterized by consistent engagement of dorsal striatal, midbrain, thalamic, premotor, and prefrontal subregions. These findings suggest that safety learning via conditioned inhibition involves a distributed cortico-striatal circuitry, separable from broader cortical regions involved with processing standard safety signals (e.g., CS<sup>&ndash;</sup>). This cortico-striatal system could represent a novel neural substrate of safety learning, underlying the initial generation of "stimulus&ndash;safety" associations, distinct from wider cortical correlates of safety processing, which facilitate the behavioral outcomes of learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying safety is critical for maintaining adaptive levels of anxiety, but the neural mechanisms of human safety learning remain unclear. Using 7 Tesla fMRI, we compared learning-related brain activity for a conditioned inhibitor, which actively predicted threat omission, and a standard safety signal (CS<sup>&ndash;</sup>), which was passively unpaired with threat. The inhibitor engaged an extended circuitry primarily featuring the dorsal striatum, along with thalamic, midbrain, and premotor/PFC regions. The CS<sup>&ndash;</sup> exclusively involved cortical safety-related regions observed in basic safety conditioning, such as the vmPFC. These findings extend current models to include learning-specific mechanisms for encoding stimulus&ndash;safety associations, which might be distinguished from expression-related cortical mechanisms. These insights may suggest novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional safety learning in psychopathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Alpha-Band Oscillations Bias Subjective Contrast Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perceptual decisions depend both on the features of the incoming stimulus and on the ongoing brain activity at the moment the stimulus is received. Specifically, trial-to-trial fluctuations in cortical excitability have been linked to fluctuations in the amplitude of prestimulus &alpha; oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which are in turn are associated with fluctuations in subjects' tendency to report the detection of a stimulus. It is currently unknown whether &alpha; oscillations bias postperceptual decision-making, or even bias subjective perception itself. To answer this question, we used a contrast discrimination task in which both male and female human subjects reported which of two gratings (one in each hemifield) was perceived as having a stronger contrast. Our EEG analysis showed that subjective contrast was reduced for the stimulus in the hemifield represented in the hemisphere with relatively stronger prestimulus &alpha; amplitude, reflecting reduced cortical excitability. Furthermore, the strength of this spontaneous hemispheric lateralization was strongly correlated with the magnitude of individual subjects' biases, suggesting that the spontaneous patterns of &alpha; lateralization play a role in explaining the intersubject variability in contrast perception. These results indicate that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, indicated by patterns of prestimulus &alpha; amplitude, affect perceptual decisions by altering the phenomenological perception of the visual world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our moment-to-moment perception of the world is shaped by the features of the environment surrounding us, as much as by the constantly evolving states that characterize our brain activity. Previous research showed how the ongoing electrical activity of the brain can influence whether a stimulus has accessed conscious perception. However, evidence is currently missing on whether these electrical brain states can be associated to the subjective experience of a sensory input. Here we show that local changes in patterns of electrical brain activity preceding visual stimulation can bias our phenomenological perception. Importantly, we show that the strength of these variations can help explain the great interindividual variability in how we perceive the visual environment surrounding us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Visual Experience in Individual Differences of Brain Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual cortex organization is highly consistent across individuals. But to what degree does this consistency depend on life experience, in particular sensory experience? In this study, we asked whether visual cortex reorganization in congenital blindness results in connectivity patterns that are particularly variable across individuals, focusing on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns from the primary visual cortex. We show that the absence of shared visual experience results in more variable RSFC patterns across blind individuals than sighted controls. Increased variability is specifically found in areas that show a group difference between the blind and sighted in their RSFC. These findings reveal a relationship between brain plasticity and individual variability; reorganization manifests variably across individuals. We further investigated the different patterns of reorganization in the blind, showing that the connectivity to frontal regions, proposed to have a role in the reorganization of the visual cortex of the blind toward higher cognitive roles, is highly variable. Further, we link some of the variability in visual-to-frontal connectivity to another environmental factor&mdash;duration of formal education. Together, these findings show a role of postnatal sensory and socioeconomic experience in imposing consistency on brain organization. By revealing the idiosyncratic nature of neural reorganization, these findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in fitting sensory aids and restoration approaches for vision loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The typical visual system is highly consistent across individuals. What are the origins of this consistency? Comparing the consistency of visual cortex connectivity between people born blind and sighted people, we showed that blindness results in higher variability, suggesting a key impact of postnatal individual experience on brain organization. Further, connectivity patterns that changed following blindness were particularly variable, resulting in diverse patterns of brain reorganization. Individual differences in reorganization were also directly affected by nonvisual experiences in the blind (years of formal education). Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experiences in creating individual differences in brain organization and endorse the use of individual profiles for rehabilitation and restoration of vision loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Endosomal Sorting in Schwann Cells Leads to Defective Myelination and Endosomal Abnormalities Observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endosomal sorting plays a fundamental role in directing neural development. By altering the temporal and spatial distribution of membrane receptors, endosomes regulate signaling pathways that control the differentiation and function of neural cells. Several genes linked to inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, encode proteins that directly interact with components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Our previous studies demonstrated that a point mutation in the ESCRT component hepatocyte growth-factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), an endosomal scaffolding protein that identifies internalized cargo to be sorted by the endosome, causes a peripheral neuropathy in the neurodevelopmentally impaired <I>teetering</I> mice. Here, we constructed a Schwann cell-specific deletion of <I>Hgs</I> to determine the role of endosomal sorting during myelination. Inactivation of HGS in Schwann cells resulted in motor and sensory deficits, slowed nerve conduction velocities, delayed myelination and hypomyelinated axons, all of which occur in demyelinating forms of CMT. Consistent with a delay in Schwann cell maturation, HGS-deficient sciatic nerves displayed increased mRNA levels for several promyelinating genes and decreased mRNA levels for genes that serve as markers of myelinating Schwann cells. Loss of HGS also altered the abundance and activation of the ERBB2/3 receptors, which are essential for Schwann cell development. We therefore hypothesize that HGS plays a critical role in endosomal sorting of the ERBB2/3 receptors during Schwann cell maturation, which further implicates endosomal dysfunction in inherited peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Schwann cells myelinate peripheral axons, and defects in Schwann cell function cause inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathies known as CMT. Although many CMT-linked mutations are in genes that encode putative endosomal proteins, little is known about the requirements of endosomal sorting during myelination. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of HGS disrupts the endosomal sorting pathway in Schwann cells, resulting in hypomyelination, aberrant myelin sheaths, and impairment of the ERBB2/3 receptor pathway. These findings suggest that defective endosomal trafficking of internalized cell surface receptors may be a common mechanism contributing to demyelinating CMT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Calpain-2 Mediates MBNL2 Degradation and a Developmental RNA Processing Program in Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Increasing loss of structure and function of neurons and decline in cognitive function is commonly seen during the progression of neurologic diseases, although the causes and initial symptoms of individual diseases are distinct. This observation suggests a convergence of common degenerative features. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the expression of expanded CUG RNA induces neurotransmission dysfunction before axon and dendrite degeneration and reduced MBNL2 expression associated with aberrant alternative splicing. The role of loss of function of MBNL2 in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and the causal mechanism of neurodegeneration-reduced expression of MBNL2 remain elusive. Here, we show that increased MBNL2 expression is associated with neuronal maturation and required for neuronal morphogenesis and the fetal to adult developmental transition of RNA processing. Neurodegenerative conditions including NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity and dysregulated calcium homeostasis triggered nuclear translocation of calpain-2, thus resulting in MBNL2 degradation and reversal of MBNL2-regulated RNA processing to developmental patterns. Nuclear expression of calpain-2 resembled its developmental pattern and was associated with MBNL2 degradation. Knock-down of calpain-2 expression or inhibition of calpain-2 nuclear translocation prevented neurodegeneration-reduced MBNL2 expression and dysregulated RNA processing. Increased calpain-2 nuclear translocation associated with reduced MBNL2 expression and aberrant RNA processing occurred in models for DM1 and Alzheimer's disease (AD) including EpA960/CaMKII-Cre mice of either sex and female APP/PS1 and THY-Tau22 mice. Our results identify a regulatory mechanism for MBNL2 downregulation and suggest that calpain-2-mediated MBNL2 degradation accompanied by re-induction of a developmental RNA processing program may be a converging pathway to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurologic diseases share many features during disease progression, such as cognitive decline and brain atrophy, which suggests a common pathway for developing degenerative features. Here, we show that the neurodegenerative conditions glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and dysregulated calcium homeostasis induced translocation of the cysteine protease calpain-2 into the nucleus, resulting in MBNL2 degradation and reversal of MBNL2-regulated RNA processing to an embryonic pattern. Knock-down or inhibition of nuclear translocation of calpain-2 prevented MBNL2 degradation and maintained MBNL2-regulated RNA processing in the adult pattern. Models of myotonic dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) also showed calpain-2-mediated MBNL2 degradation and a developmental RNA processing program. Our studies suggest MBNL2 function disrupted by calpain-2 as a common pathway, thus providing an alternative therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Probe into the Behavioral and Neural Markers of Atypical Facial Emotion Processing in Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite ample behavioral evidence of atypical facial emotion processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the neural underpinnings of such behavioral heterogeneities remain unclear. Here, I have used brain-tissue mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of primate vision to probe candidate neural and behavior markers of atypical facial emotion recognition in ASD at an image-by-image level. Interestingly, the image-level behavioral patterns of the ANNs better matched the neurotypical subjects 'behavior than those measured in ASD. This behavioral mismatch was most remarkable when the ANN behavior was decoded from units that correspond to the primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex. ANN-IT responses also explained a significant fraction of the image-level behavioral predictivity associated with neural activity in the human amygdala (from epileptic patients without ASD), strongly suggesting that the previously reported facial emotion intensity encodes in the human amygdala could be primarily driven by projections from the IT cortex. In sum, these results identify primate IT activity as a candidate neural marker and demonstrate how ANN models of vision can be used to generate neural circuit-level hypotheses and guide future human and nonhuman primate studies in autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Moving beyond standard parametric approaches that predict behavior with high-level categorical descriptors of a stimulus (e.g., level of happiness/fear in a face image), in this study, I demonstrate how an image-level probe, using current deep-learning-based ANN models, allows identification of more diagnostic stimuli for autism spectrum disorder enabling the design of more powerful experiments. This study predicts that IT cortex activity is a key candidate neural marker of atypical facial emotion processing in people with ASD. Importantly, the results strongly suggest that ASD-related atypical facial emotion intensity encodes in the human amygdala could be primarily driven by projections from the IT cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The acceptability and side effects of COVID-19 vaccine among health care workers in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is global public health crisis. Mass vaccination, until herd immunity is achieved, is one of the most effective ways of combating the deadly infectious virus. The disposition of health workers towards the AstraZeneca vaccine will most likely determine if other members of the community will be willing to get vaccinated or not. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as determine the various side effects experienced by those who have already been vaccinated. Method: Frequency tables were created, and Chi-square was used to determine the relationship between respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their acceptance or rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine and attitude towards it. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the key factors which influenced respondents’ decision to have the vaccine. Result: There was a statistically significant relationship between the cadre of health care workers, their tribe, and their involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients and their attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusion: Previous involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients is one of the most important determinants of health care workers' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were positive about the vaccine; however, the fear of side effects was the primary reason why those who were yet to be vaccinated, do not plan to do so. The most common side effect reported by those who had already been vaccinated, was pain at the injection site. Public awareness of the vaccine and its benefits should be increased, and the vaccine should be made available in all health care facilities.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

                Background: Malaysia is embarking on sustainable, resilient, and prosperous living conditions initiatives. Malaysian cities are embracing the smart city aspiration through their respective local authorities. However, they face challenges regarding  funding allocation for smart city implementation. Local authorities primarily operate on a conventional business model. Based on their current business model, they are unlikely to sustain their smart city initiatives. A more financially sustainable business model is required by these local authorities to embark on smart city initiatives. This study presents a systematic review concerning the business models adopted by local authorities to implement smart cities. This paper also explores the applicability of frugal innovation towards developing a smart city business model. Methods: This article undertakes a systematic review based on combination sets of eight main keywords: smart city, business model, frugal innovation, local authorities, performance, inclusivity, technology and success factor. The search strategy includes journal articles and conference proceedings from five major online databases: Emerald, ProQuest, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link between 2001-2021. The data is tabulated for clear expression of knowledge gaps. Results: A total of 17 articles from 300 articles on smart city business models matched the search on smart city business models for local authorities . The study revealed that hardly any in-depth research providing the crucial elements for a successful smart city business model for local authorities has been conducted. No research has linked frugal innovation to smart city business models. Conclusions: The study calls upon the research community to explore further, the possible linkage between frugal innovation and smart cities for local authorities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Topological Sholl descriptors for neuronal clustering and classification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Reem Khalil, Sadok Kallel, Ahmad Farhat, Pawel Dlotko</p>

Neuronal morphology is a fundamental factor influencing information processing within neurons and networks. Dendritic morphology in particular can widely vary among cell classes, brain regions, and animal species. Thus, accurate quantitative descriptions allowing classification of large sets of neurons is essential for their structural and functional characterization. Current robust and unbiased computational methods that characterize groups of neurons are scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to study dendritic morphology, complementing and advancing many of the existing techniques. Our approach is to conceptualize the notion of a Sholl descriptor and associate, for each morphological feature, and to each neuron, a function of the radial distance from the soma, taking values in a metric space. Functional distances give rise to pseudo-metrics on sets of neurons which are then used to perform the two distinct tasks of clustering and classification. To illustrate the use of Sholl descriptors, four datasets were retrieved from the large public repository https://neuromorpho.org/ comprising neuronal reconstructions from different species and brain regions. Sholl descriptors were subsequently computed, and standard clustering methods enhanced with detection and metric learning algorithms were then used to objectively cluster and classify each dataset. Importantly, our descriptors outperformed conventional morphometric techniques (L-Measure metrics) in several of the tested datasets. Therefore, we offer a novel and effective approach to the analysis of diverse neuronal cell types, and provide a toolkit for researchers to cluster and classify neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying biochemical reaction rates from static population variability within incompletely observed complex networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timon Wittenstein, Nava Leibovich, Andreas Hilfinger</p>

Quantifying biochemical reaction rates within complex cellular processes remains a key challenge of systems biology even as high-throughput single-cell data have become available to characterize snapshots of population variability. That is because complex systems with stochastic and non-linear interactions are difficult to analyze when not all components can be observed simultaneously and systems cannot be followed over time. Instead of using descriptive statistical models, we show that incompletely specified mechanistic models can be used to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into reaction rate functions from covariability data between pairs of components. This promises to turn a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their stochastic fluctuations.

Internal models capture the regularities of the environment and are central to understanding how humans adapt to environmental statistics. In general, the correct internal model is unknown to observers, instead they rely on an approximate model that is continually adapted throughout learning. However, experimenters assume an ideal observer model, which captures stimulus structure but ignores the diverging hypotheses that humans form during learning. We combine non-parametric Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming to infer rich and dynamic individualised internal models from response times. We demonstrate that the approach is capable of characterizing the discrepancy between the internal model maintained by individuals and the ideal observer model and to track the evolution of the contribution of the ideal observer model to the internal model throughout training. In particular, in an implicit visuomotor sequence learning task the identified discrepancy revealed an inductive bias that was consistent across individuals but varied in strength and persistence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A method for the inference of cytokine interaction networks</a></h4>

Cell-cell communication is mediated by many soluble mediators, including over 40 cytokines. Cytokines, e.g. TNF, IL1<i>β</i>, IL5, IL6, IL12 and IL23, represent important therapeutic targets in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, asthma, rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis. The identification of cytokines that are causative drivers of, and not just associated with, inflammation is fundamental for selecting therapeutic targets that should be studied in clinical trials. As <i>in vitro</i> models of cytokine interactions provide a simplified framework to study complex <i>in vivo</i> interactions, and can easily be perturbed experimentally, they are key for identifying such targets. We present a method to extract a minimal, weighted cytokine interaction network, given <i>in vitro</i> data on the effects of the blockage of single cytokine receptors on the secretion rate of other cytokines. Existing biological network inference methods typically consider the correlation structure of the underlying dataset, but this can make them poorly suited for highly connected, non-linear cytokine interaction data. Our method uses ordinary differential equation systems to represent cytokine interactions, and efficiently computes the configuration with the lowest Akaike information criterion value for all possible network configurations. It enables us to study indirect cytokine interactions and quantify inhibition effects. The extracted network can also be used to predict the combined effects of inhibiting various cytokines simultaneously. The model equations can easily be adjusted to incorporate more complicated dynamics and accommodate temporal data. We validate our method using synthetic datasets and apply our method to an experimental dataset on the regulation of IL23, a cytokine with therapeutic relevance in psoriasis and IBD. We validate several model predictions against experimental data that were not used for model fitting. In summary, we present a novel method specifically designed to efficiently infer cytokine interaction networks from cytokine perturbation data in the context of IMIDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic inference of indirect transcriptional regulation by protein kinases and phosphatases</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christian Degnbol Madsen, Jotun Hein, Christopher T. Workman</p>

Gene expression is controlled by pathways of regulatory factors often involving the activity of protein kinases on transcription factor proteins. Despite this well established mechanism, the number of well described pathways that include the regulatory role of protein kinases on transcription factors is surprisingly scarce in eukaryotes.
To address this, <i>PhosTF</i> was developed to infer functional regulatory interactions and pathways in both simulated and real biological networks, based on linear cyclic causal models with latent variables. <i>GeneNetWeaverPhos</i>, an extension of <i>GeneNetWeaver</i>, was developed to allow the simulation of perturbations in known networks that included the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases on gene regulation. Over 2000 genome-wide gene expression profiles, where the loss or gain of regulatory genes could be observed to perturb gene regulation, were then used to infer the existence of regulatory interactions, and their mode of regulation in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.
Despite the additional complexity, our inference performed comparably to the best methods that inferred transcription factor regulation assessed in the <i>DREAM4</i> challenge on similar simulated networks. Inference on integrated genome-scale data sets for yeast identified ∼ 8800 protein kinase/phosphatase-transcription factor interactions and ∼ 6500 interactions among protein kinases and/or phosphatases. Both types of regulatory predictions captured statistically significant numbers of known interactions of their type. Surprisingly, kinases and phosphatases regulated transcription factors by a negative mode or regulation (deactivation) in over 70% of the predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">An open-access database of infectious disease transmission trees to explore superspreader epidemiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juliana C. Taube, Paige B. Miller, John M. Drake</p>

Historically, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multinational outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database, called OutbreakTrees, of 382 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we calculated several key statistics, such as tree size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the proportion of cases considered superspreaders, and examined how these statistics varied over the course of each outbreak and under different assumptions about the completeness of outbreak investigations. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through 2 short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, we found that our transmission trees were consistent with theory predicting that intermediate dispersion parameters give rise to the highest proportion of cases causing superspreading events. Additionally, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than 1 superspreader, we found preliminary support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading in COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of other diseases and suggest an approach to further research regarding the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.

<p>In the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>), each note of its rapid frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by modulation of larynx, breath, and gape. To elucidate the circuitry underlying song, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into two vocal muscles. We observed infection in separate motorneuron pools for each muscle, then coinfection in putative central pattern generators, followed by forebrain hypothalamic and limbic regions, and finally cortex. Our data suggest hierarchical song control resembles known circuits for both rodents and primates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocalizations are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. The progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has become a significant target of stress research in recent years because of its role in cognitive functioning, neuropathology, and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Despite the pervasive impact of stress on psychiatric and neurological disease, many of the circuit- and cell-dependent mechanisms giving rise to the limbic regulation of the stress response remain unknown. Hippocampal excitatory neurons generally express high levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and are therefore positioned to respond directly to serum glucocorticoids. These neurons are, in turn, regulated by neighboring interneurons, subtypes of which have been shown to respond to stress exposure. However, GR expression among hippocampal interneurons is not well characterized. To determine whether key interneuron populations are direct targets for glucocorticoid action, we used two transgenic mouse lines to label parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. GR immunostaining of labeled interneurons was characterized within the dorsal and ventral dentate hilus, dentate cell body layer, and CA1 and CA3 stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale. While nearly all hippocampal SST+ interneurons expressed GR across all regions, GR labeling of PV+ interneurons showed considerable subregion variability. The percentage of PV+, GR+ cells was highest in the CA3 stratum pyramidale and lowest in the CA1 stratum oriens, with other regions showing intermediate levels of expression. Together, these findings indicate that, under baseline conditions, hippocampal SST+ interneurons are a ubiquitous glucocorticoid target, while only distinct populations of PV+ interneurons are direct targets. This anatomical diversity suggests functional differences in the regulation of stress-dependent hippocampal responses.</p>

     alt="Integrated age-related immunohistological changes occur in human olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb"/>
<p>During human development a complete uninterrupted sheet of neuronal competent mucosa with well demarcated borders comprises the olfactory epithelium (OE) within the superior aspect of the nasal cavity along the septum and lateral wall. The axons of olfactory neurons within the epithelium target glomeruli along the peripheral edges of the olfactory bulb (OB). With advancing age, regions of the OE are disrupted and replaced with respiratory or aneuronal epithelium while the border becomes less defined. A decreasing area of OE occurs with a shift of neuronal density in a more posterior-dorsal direction. Intraepithelial neuromas and subepithelial cysts develop along with a decrease in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Proximally, distortions in olfactory targeting occur within the OB with an overall reduction in synapses in the ventral portion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory epithelium (OE) is capable of lifelong regeneration due to presence of basal progenitor cells that respond to injury or neuronal loss with increased activity. However, this capability diminishes with advancing age and a decrease in odor perception in older individuals is well established. To characterize changes associated with age in the peripheral olfactory system, an in-depth analysis of the OE and its neuronal projections onto the olfactory bulb (OB) as a function of age was performed. Human olfactory tissue autopsy samples from 36 subjects with an average age of 74.1 years were analyzed. Established cell type-specific antibodies were used to identify OE component cells in whole mucosal sheets and epithelial sections as well as glomeruli and periglomerular structures in OB sections. With age, a reduction in OE area occurs across the mucosa progressing in a posterior-dorsal direction. Deterioration of the olfactory system is accompanied with diminution of neuron-containing OE, mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and OB innervation. On an individual level, the neuronal density within the epithelium appears to predict synapse density within the OB. The innervation of the OB is uneven with higher density at the ventral half that decreases with age as opposed to stable innervation at the dorsal half. Respiratory metaplasia, submucosal cysts, and neuromata, were commonly identified in aged OE. The finding of respiratory metaplasia and aneuronal epithelium with reduction in global basal cells suggests a progression of stem cell quiescence as an underlying pathophysiology of age-related smell loss in humans.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>A gradual loss of olfactory sensory neurons with age in human olfactory epithelium is also reflected in a reduction in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>This gradual loss of neurons and synaptic connections with age occurs in a specific, spatially inhomogeneous manner.</p>
<p>Decreasing mitotically active olfactory epithelium basal cells may contribute to age-related neuronal decline and smell loss in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The diversity of the diprotodontids provides an excellent opportunity to study how a basic marsupial cortical plan has been modified for the needs of the mammals living in different habitats. Very little is known about the connections of the cerebral cortex with the deep brain structures (basal ganglia and thalamus) in this evolutionarily significant group of mammals. In this study, we performed mapping of brain regions and connections in a diprotodontid marsupial from data obtained from an excised brain scanned in high-field (9.4 T) microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument. The analysis was based on two MRI methodologies. First, high-resolution structural scans were used to map MRI visible brain regions from T1w and T2w images. Second, extensive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained to elucidate connectivity between brain areas using deterministic diffusion tracking of neuronal brain fibers. From the data, we were able to identify corticostriate connections between the frontal association and dorsomedial isocortex and the head of the caudate, and between the lateral somatosensory cortex and the putamen. We were also able to follow the olfactory and limbic connections by tracing fibers in the fornix, cingulum, intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure, and lateral olfactory tract. There was segregation of fibers in the anterior commissure such that olfactory connections passed through the rostroventral part and successively more dorsal cortical areas connected through more dorsal parts of the commissure. Our findings confirm a common pattern of cortical connectivity in therian mammals, even where brain expansion has occurred independently in diverse groups.</p>

     alt="Lifespan of mature olfactory sensory neurons varies with location in the mouse olfactory epithelium and age of the animal"/>
<p>A genetic model based on the expression of an OMP-tTA transgene has been used for assessing survival of mature olfactory sensory neurons as a function of age of the animal and region of the olfactory epithelium (OE). A near-majority and a majority of mature neurons at 2 months and 4.5 months of age, respectively, live for more than 6 months demonstrating substantial stability of this sensory epithelium. However, the lifespan differs between dorsal and ventral epithelium. The diagram summarizes the relationship between mature neuron survival and rate of basal cell proliferation in dorsal vs. ventral OE.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE) exhibit a remarkable regenerative capability, which protects the population against environmental insult and enables adjustment to new odors. The lifespan of OSNs is still open to question, with estimates ranging from 1 month to at least 1 year. However, the estimates come with some caveats, including low labeling efficiency and a focus solely on newborn neurons. We revisited the issue via the use of OMP-tTA; TetO-Cre; Rosa26-fl(stop)-Tdtomato (OMP-tTA;TdT) mice, which allowed us to selectively label ∼95% of the OMP(+) OSN population that reach maturity by a given time and, by switching to doxycycline chow, to “chase” this preexisting OSN population. Two loading protocols were used: conception to 2 months old and conception to 4.5 months old. Surviving OSNs were common up to 6 months chase time in both groups, but more neurons survived when loading for 4.5 months as compared with 2 months. A spatial difference was evident: higher percentages of OSNs survived in the dorsomedial OE as compared with ventrolateral and in posterior versus anterior OE regions. Finally, proliferation rates anticorrelated with the spatial differences in OSN survival; higher proliferation rates were observed ventrally. Together, these results demonstrate spatial and temporal differences in OSN survival, highlighting it as a dynamic system that can be studied for factors affecting neuronal survival.</p>

<p>The diversity of retinal ganglion cell subtypes spans further than protein markers, morphology, and physiology. Their primary cilia, microtubule based signaling “antennae” can be different as well. Immunofluorescent staining for prototypical primary cilia markers, Arl13b and AC3, showed that some RGC subtypes harbor one or the other marker and sometimes both

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies several forms of retinal disease including glaucomatous optic neuropathy, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several rare genetic disorders associated with cilia dysfunction have retinal degeneration as a clinical hallmark. Much of the focus of ciliopathy associated blindness is on the connecting cilium of photoreceptors; however, RGCs also possess primary cilia. It is unclear what roles RGC cilia play, what proteins and signaling machinery localize to RGC cilia, or how RGC cilia are differentiated across the subtypes of RGCs. To better understand these questions, we assessed the presence or absence of a prototypical cilia marker Arl13b and a widely distributed neuronal cilia marker AC3 in different subtypes of mouse RGCs. Interestingly, not all RGC subtype cilia are the same and there are significant differences even among these standard cilia markers. Alpha-RGCs positive for osteopontin, calretinin, and SMI32 primarily possess AC3-positive cilia. Directionally selective RGCs that are CART positive or Trhr positive localize either Arl13b or AC3, respectively, in cilia. Intrinsically photosensitive RGCs differentially localize Arl13b and AC3 based on melanopsin expression. Taken together, we characterized the localization of gold standard cilia markers in different subtypes of RGCs and conclude that cilia within RGC subtypes may be differentially organized. Future studies aimed at understanding RGC cilia function will require a fundamental ability to observe the cilia across subtypes as their signaling protein composition is elucidated. A comprehensive understanding of RGC cilia may reveal opportunities to understanding how their dysfunction leads to retinal degeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Florida manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus latirostris</i>) and rock hyraxes (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) exhibit expanded tactile arrays of vibrissae that are distributed not only on the face but also on the entire postfacial body. In contrast, the vibrissae of most mammals are principally restricted to the face. These facial vibrissae may be associated with central nervous system representations known as barrels in the cerebral cortex, barreloids in the thalamus, and barrelettes in the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. To date, vibrissae representations found within the brainstem have been principally limited to facial vibrissae representations in the trigeminal nuclei. We hypothesized that the tactile specializations of the manatee and rock hyrax would produce a unique modification of typical mammalian central nervous system organization, with postfacial vibrissae representations appearing in the cuneate and gracile nuclei as “body barrelettes.” Using histological and histochemical methods, including cresyl violet, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase processing, we first delineated the rostral, middle, and caudal zones of the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Within the middle zone, divisions were present, including extensive parcellation in the cluster region, particularly in manatees. These clusters were particularly densely distributed and distinguishable in the presumptive postfacial body representations in the cuneate and gracile nuclei but otherwise shared many attributes with the barrelettes found in the trigeminal nuclei of other species. This study represents the first characterization of postfacial body vibrissae representations, or “body barrelettes,” in the brainstem of any species. Previous studies have predominantly focused on facial vibrissae representations, which have served for decades as a model for sensory organization and plasticity. Our results extend what is known about vibrissae representations in the central nervous system to include expansions related to peripheral specializations of the postfacial body. Unusual somatosensory adaptations in the manatee and rock hyrax are highly informative regarding how mammalian brain organization responds to evolutionary pressures on sensory systems.</p>

<p>The African spiny mouse, <i>Acomys cahirinus</i>, is a rodent with a unique regenerative capability among mammals. Studies on <i>A. cahirinus</i> brain are limited due to the lack of knowledge of its neuroanatomy. The brain of <i>A. cahirinus</i> was mapped in a coronal atlas in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet staining. This atlas of the <i>A. cahirinus</i> represents a new tool for neuroscience studies in a new model for brain repair.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The African spiny mouse (<i>Acomys cahirinus</i>) is an emerging model of mammalian epimorphic regeneration that has aroused the interest of the scientific community in the last decade. To date, studies on brain repair have been hindered by the lack of knowledge on the neuroanatomy of this species. Here, we present a coronal brain atlas in stereotaxic coordinates, which allows for three-dimensional identification and localization of the brain structures of this species. The brain of 12-week-old spiny mice was mapped in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet-stained brain sections obtained from coronal cryosectioning of the brain after transcardial perfusion with fixative. The atlas is presented in 42 plates representing sections spaced 240 μm apart. Stereotaxic coordinates were validated using both a model of Parkinsonian lesion of the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine and labeling of the corticospinal tract in the spiny mouse spinal cord using AAV1/2-GFP intracortical injections. This work presents a new tool in <i>A. cahirinus</i> neurobiology and opens new avenues of research for the investigation of the regenerative ability of <i>A. cahirinus</i> in models of brain disorders.</p>

<p>Rosy bitterling brain at 165 hours postfertilization. Tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT in this very early stage. Three-dimensional visualization with microCT scanning protocols is extremely useful for the study of the rosy bitterling and provides an updating of imaging modalities for morphological and anatomical analyses in this nonmodel organism.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bitterlings are carp-like teleost fish (Cypriniformes: Acheilanathidae) known for their specialized brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos, in fact, develop inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about how their parasitic lifestyle affects brain development in comparison to nonparasitic species. Here, we document the development of the brain of the rosy bitterling, <i>Rhodeus ocellatus</i>, at four embryonic stages of 165, 185, 210, 235 hours postfertilization (hpf) using micro-computed tomography (microCT). Focusing on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization, we relate the development of the brain divisions to those described for zebrafish using the prosomeric model as a reference paradigm. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system allowed us to identify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. The results show that during early embryonic and larval development, histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT. The results of this study visualized with differential CT profiles are broadly consistent with comparable histological studies, and with the genoarchitecture of teleosts like the zebrafish. Compared to the zebrafish, our study identifies distinct developmental heterochronies in the rosy bitterling, such as a precocious development of the inferior lobe.</p>

There are large geographical variations in burnout rates with 16–20% of gastroenterologists in Mexico and Germany being at risk or having burnout, 30–40% in the United Kingdom, and 50–55% in South Korea, Canada, and the USA. The investigation of differential associations of burnout with important factors in gastroenterologists leading to tailored therapy recommendations is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the associations between work satisfaction and burnout in this specialization. Methods: We distributed an electronic survey to gastroenterologists organized mainly in the Federal Organization of Gastroenterology in Germany (the BVGD - Bundesverband Gastroenterologie Deutschland). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire (WSQ) were examined regarding their postulated internal structure in our sample of gastroenterologists. Canonical correlations were performed to examine the association between work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians. Results: An acceptable model fit was shown for both the MBI and the Work Satisfaction Questionnaire. The canonical correlation analysis resulted in two statistically significant canonical functions with correlations of .62 (p<.001) and .27 (p<.001). The full model across all functions was significant (χ2 (18) = 386.26, p<.001). Burden, personal rewards, and global item regarding the job situation were good predictors for less exhaustion, while patient care and professional relations were good predictors for personal accomplishment. This supports the recognition of burnout as being a multidimensional construct which has to be thoroughly diagnosed. Conclusions: Specific interventions should be designed to improve symptoms of burnout in endoscopy physicians according to their individual complaints as burnout is a multidimensional construct. Differential interventions should be offered on the basis of our study results in order to alleviate the issue of work satisfaction and burnout in endoscopy physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Deep supervised hashing for gait retrieval [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gait recognition is perceived as the most promising biometric approach for future decades especially because of its efficient applicability in surveillance systems. Due to recent growth in the use of gait biometrics across surveillance systems, the ability to rapidly search for the required data has become an emerging need. Therefore, we addressed the gait retrieval problem, which retrieves people with gaits similar to a query subject from a large-scale dataset. Methods: This paper presents the deep gait retrieval hashing (DGRH) model to address the gait retrieval problem for large-scale datasets. Our proposed method is based on a supervised hashing method with a deep convolutional network. We use the ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the semantic gait features for feature representation and learn the compact hash codes with the compatible hash function. Therefore, our DGRH model combines gait feature learning with binary hash codes. In addition, the learning loss is designed with a classification loss function that learns to preserve similarity and a quantization loss function that controls the quality of the hash codes Results: The proposed method was evaluated against the CASIA-B, OUISIR-LP, and OUISIR-MVLP benchmark datasets and received the promising result for gait retrieval tasks. Conclusions: The end-to-end deep supervised hashing model is able to learn discriminative gait features and is efficient in terms of the storage memory and speed for gait retrieval.

                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

                Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science research are promising tools to better inform public policy and public health responses, promoting automation and affordability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has been an aid to forecast outbreak spread globally. The overall aim of the study is to contribute to the ongoing public health, socioeconomic, and communication challenges caused by COVID-19. Protocol: COLEV is a five-pronged interdisciplinary mixed methods project based on AI and data science from an inclusive perspective of age and gender to develop, implement, and communicate useful evidence for COVID-19-related response and recovery in Colombia. The first objective is identification of stakeholders’ preferences, needs, and their use of AI and data science relative to other forms of evidence. The second objective will develop locally relevant mathematical models that will shed light on the possible impact, trajectories, geographical spread, and uncertainties of disease progression as well as risk assessment. The third objective focuses on estimating the effect of COVID-19 on other diseases, gender disparities and health system saturation. The fourth objective aims to analyze popular social networks to identify health-related trending interest and users that act as ‘super spreaders’ for information and misinformation. Finally, the fifth objective, aims at designing disruptive cross-media communication strategies to confront mis- and dis-information around COVID-19. To understand stakeholders’ perspectives, we will use semi-structured interviews and ethnographic work. Daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 reported from the National Surveillance System (INS) of Colombia will be used for quantitative analysis, and data regarding the online conversation will be obtained from Facebook and Twitter. Conclusions: COLEV intends to facilitate the dialogue between academia and health policymakers. The results of COLEV will inform on the responsible, safe and ethical use of AI and data science for decision-making in the context of sanitary emergencies in deeply unequal settings.

<p>We demonstrate that administration of a novel selenopeptide named PSELT to a lesioned facial nerve improved its regeneration and ameliorated motor performances in rat, strongly suggesting that PSELT is a valuable therapeutic candidate to treat peripheral nerve injuries.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is frequent and many patients suffer lifelong disabilities in severe cases. Although the peripheral nervous system is able to regenerate, its potential is limited. In this study, we tested in a nerve regeneration model in rat the potential beneficial effect of a short mimetic peptide, named PSELT, which derives from SELENOT, an essential thioredoxin-like selenoprotein endowed with neuroprotective and antioxidant activities. For this purpose, the right facial nerve of female Long–Evans rats was axotomized then bridged with a free femoral vein interposition graft. PSELT (1 μM) was injected into the vein immediately and 48 h after the injury, and the effects observed were compared to those found after an end-to-end suture used as a gold standard treatment. Whisking behavior, electrophysiological potential, and histological analyses were performed 3 months after injury to determine the effects of these treatments. These analyses revealed that PSELT-treated animals exhibit a better motor recovery in terms of protraction amplitude and velocity of vibrissae compared to control and end-sutured nerve animal groups. Moreover, administration of PSELT following injury enhanced muscle innervation, axonal elongation, and myelination of newly formed nerve fibers. Altogether, these results indicate that a PSELT-based treatment is sufficient to enhance facial nerve myelination and regeneration and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat PNI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Episodic boundary cells in human medial temporal lobe during the free recall task</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A necessary condition for forming episodic memories is the construction of specific episodes demarcated from other episodes in space and time. Evidence from studies of episodic memory formation using rodent models suggest that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) supports the representation of boundary information. Building on recent work using human microelectrode recordings as well, we hypothesized of human MTL neurons with firing rates sensitive to episodic boundary information. We identified 27 episodic boundary neurons out of 736 single neurons recorded across 27 subjects. Firing of these neurons increased at the beginning and end of mnemonically relevant episodes in the free recall task. We distinguish episodic boundary neurons from a population of ramping neurons (<i>n</i> = 58), which are time-sensitive neurons whose activity provides complementary information during episodic representation. Episodic boundary neurons exhibited a U-shaped activity pattern demonstrating increased activity after both beginning and end boundaries of encoding and retrieval epochs. We also describe evidence that the firing of boundary neurons within episodic boundaries is organized by hippocampal theta oscillations, using spike-field coherence metrics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Dominant role of adult neurogenesis‐induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and synapses manifest pronounced variability in the amount of plasticity induced by identical activity patterns. The mechanisms underlying such plasticity heterogeneity, which have been implicated in context-specific resource allocation during encoding, have remained unexplored. Here, we employed a systematic physiologically constrained parametric search to identify the cellular mechanisms behind plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells. We used heterogeneous model populations to ensure that our conclusions were not biased by parametric choices in a single hand-tuned model. We found that each of intrinsic, synaptic, and structural heterogeneities independently yielded heterogeneities in synaptic plasticity profiles obtained with two different induction protocols. However, among the disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities, our analyses demonstrated the dominance of neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in granule cells. We found that strong relationships between neuronal intrinsic excitability and plasticity emerged only when adult neurogenesis-induced heterogeneities in neural structure were accounted for. Importantly, our analyses showed that it was not imperative that the manifestation of neural-circuit heterogeneities must translate to heterogeneities in plasticity profiles. Specifically, despite the expression of heterogeneities in structural, synaptic, and intrinsic neuronal properties, similar plasticity profiles were attainable across all models through synergistic interactions among these heterogeneities. We assessed the parametric combinations required for the manifestation of such degeneracy in the expression of plasticity profiles. We found that immature cells showed physiological plasticity profiles despite receiving afferent inputs with weak synaptic strengths. Thus, the high intrinsic excitability of immature granule cells was sufficient to counterbalance their low excitatory drive in the expression of plasticity profile degeneracy. Together, our analyses demonstrate that disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities could mechanistically drive plasticity heterogeneity, but also caution against treating neural-circuit heterogeneities as proxies for plasticity heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes the need for quantitatively characterizing the relationship between neural-circuit and plasticity heterogeneities across brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Granule cell dispersion in two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy and reeler mice is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Pregnane neurosteroids exert opposite effects on GABA and glycine‐induced chloride current in isolated rat neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of endogenous neurosteroids (NSs) with pregnane skeleton modified at positions C-3 and C-5 to modulate the functional activity of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyR) and ionotropic ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) was estimated. The glycine and GABA-induced chloride current (<i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>) were measured in isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus and in isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, respectively. Our experiments demonstrated that pregnane NSs affected <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> in a different manner. At low concentrations (up to 5 μM), tested pregnane NSs increased or did not change the peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>, but reduced the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> by decreasing the peak amplitude and/or accelerating desensitization. Namely, allopregnanolone (ALLO), epipregnanolone (EPI), pregnanolone (PA), pregnanolone sulfate (PAS) and 5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP) enhanced the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> in Purkinje cells. Dose–response curves plotted in the concentration range from 1 nM to 100 μM were smooth for EPI and 5β-DHP, but bell-shaped for ALLO, PA and PAS. The peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> was reduced by PA, PAS, and 5α- and 5β-DHP. In contrast, ALLO, ISO and EPI did not modulate it. Dose–response curves for the inhibition of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> peak amplitude were smooth for all active compounds. All NSs accelerated desensitization of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub>. The dose–response relationship for this effect was smooth for ALLO, PA, PAS and 5β-DHP, but it was U-shaped for EPI, 5α-DHP and ISO. These results, together with our previous results on NSs with androstane skeleton, offer comprehensive overview for understanding the mechanisms of effects of NSs on <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Neuroplastic changes in c‐Fos, ΔFosB, BDNF, trkB, and Arc expression in the hippocampus of male Roman rats: differential effects of sexual activity</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sexual activity causes differential changes in the expression of markers of neural activation (c-Fos and ΔFosB) and neural plasticity (Arc and BDNF/trkB), as determined either by Western Blot (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and ΔFosB) or immunohistochemistry (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and c-Fos), in the hippocampus of male Roman high (RHA) and low avoidance (RLA) rats, two psychogenetically selected rat lines that display marked differences in sexual behavior (RHA rats exhibit higher sexual motivation and better copulatory performance than RLA rats). Both methods showed (with some differences) that sexual activity modifies the expression levels of these markers in the hippocampus of Roman rats depending on: (i) the level of sexual experience, that is, changes were usually more evident in sexually naïve than in experienced rats; (ii) the hippocampal partition, that is, BDNF and Arc increased in the dorsal but tended to decrease in the ventral hippocampus; (iii) the marker considered, that is, in sexually experienced animals BDNF, c-Fos, and Arc levels were similar to those of controls, while ΔFosB levels increased; and (iv) the rat line, that is, changes were usually larger in RHA than RLA rats. These findings resemble those of early studies in RHA and RLA rats showing that sexual activity influences the expression of these markers in the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area, and show for the first time that also in the hippocampus sexual activity induces neural activation and plasticity, events that occur mainly during the first phase of the acquisition of sexual experience and depend on the genotypic/phenotypic characteristics of the animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A second DNA binding site on RFC facilitates clamp loading at gapped or nicked DNA</a></h4>

              
                Clamp loaders place circular sliding clamp proteins onto DNA so that clamp-binding partner proteins can synthesize, scan, and repair the genome. DNA with nicks or small single-stranded gaps are common clamp-loading targets in DNA repair, yet these substrates would be sterically blocked given the known mechanism for binding of primer-template DNA. Here, we report the discovery of a second DNA binding site in the yeast clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) that aids in binding to nicked or gapped DNA. This DNA binding site is on the external surface and is only accessible in the open conformation of RFC. Initial DNA binding at this site thus provides access to the primary DNA binding site in the central chamber. Furthermore, we identify that this site can partially unwind DNA to create an extended single-stranded gap for DNA binding in RFC's central chamber and subsequent ATPase activation. Finally, we show that deletion of the BRCT domain, a major component of the external DNA binding site, results in defective yeast growth in the presence of DNA damage where nicked or gapped DNA intermediates occur. We propose that RFC’s external DNA binding site acts to enhance DNA binding and clamp loading, particularly at DNA architectures typically found in DNA repair.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 is involved in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is expressed in hearts and implicated in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. However, the effects of TRPV4 on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. In this study, we found that TRPV4 expression was significantly increased in mouse hypertrophic hearts, human failing hearts, and neurohormone-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Deletion of TRPV4 attenuated transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, inflammation, and the activation of NFκB - NOD - like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) in mice. Furthermore, the TRPV4 antagonist GSK2193874 (GSK3874) inhibited cardiac remodeling and dysfunction induced by TAC. In vitro, pretreatment with GSK3874 reduced the neurohormone-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration elevation. The specific TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (GSK790A) triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and evoked the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). But these effects were abolished by removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or GSK3874. More importantly, TAC or neurohormone stimulation-induced CaMKII phosphorylation was significantly blocked by TRPV4 inhibition. Finally, we show that CaMKII inhibition significantly prevented the phosphorylation of NFκB induced by GSK790A. Our results suggest that TRPV4 activation contributes to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. This effect is associated with upregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaMKII mediated activation of NFκB-NLRP3. Thus, TRPV4 may represent a potential therapeutic drug target for cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction after pressure overload.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Different brain systems support learning from received and avoided pain during human pain-avoidance learning</a></h4>

              
                Both unexpected pain and unexpected pain absence can drive avoidance learning, but whether they do so via shared or separate neural and neurochemical systems is largely unknown. To address this issue, we combined an instrumental pain-avoidance learning task with computational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic (100 mg levodopa) and opioidergic (50 mg naltrexone) systems (<i>N</i> = 83). Computational modeling provided evidence that untreated participants learned more from received than avoided pain. Our dopamine and opioid manipulations negated this learning asymmetry by selectively increasing learning rates for avoided pain. Furthermore, our fMRI analyses revealed that pain prediction errors were encoded in subcortical and limbic brain regions, whereas no-pain prediction errors were encoded in frontal and parietal cortical regions. However, we found no effects of our pharmacological manipulations on the neural encoding of prediction errors. Together, our results suggest that human pain-avoidance learning is supported by separate threat- and safety-learning systems, and that dopamine and endogenous opioids specifically regulate learning from successfully avoided pain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A new insight into RecA filament regulation by RecX from the analysis of conformation-specific interactions</a></h4>

              
                RecA protein mediates homologous recombination repair in bacteria through assembly of long helical filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in an ATP dependent manner. RecX, an important negative regulator of RecA, is known to inhibit RecA activity by stimulating the disassembly of RecA nucleoprotein filaments. Here we use a single-molecule approach to address the regulation of (<i>E. coli</i>) RecA-ssDNA filaments by RecX (<i>E. coli</i>) within the framework of distinct conformational states of RecA-ssDNA filament. Our findings revealed that RecX effectively binds the inactive conformation of RecA-ssDNA filaments and slows down the transition to the active state. Results of this work provide new mechanistic insights into the RecX-RecA interactions and highlight the importance of conformational transitions of RecA filaments as an additional level of regulation of its biological activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Live imaging of the co-translational recruitment of XBP1 mRNA to the ER and its processing by diffuse, non-polarized IRE1α</a></h4>

              
                Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to nucleus homeostatic signaling, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), relies on the non-canonical splicing of XBP1 mRNA. The molecular switch that initiates splicing is the oligomerization of the ER stress sensor and UPR endonuclease IRE1α (inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha). While IRE1α can form large clusters that have been proposed to function as XBP1 processing centers on the ER, the actual oligomeric state of active IRE1α complexes as well as the targeting mechanism that recruits XBP1 to IRE1α oligomers remains unknown. Here, we have developed a single-molecule imaging approach to monitor the recruitment of individual XBP1 transcripts to the ER surface. Using this methodology, we confirmed that stable ER association of unspliced XBP1 mRNA is established through HR2 (hydrophobic region 2)-dependent targeting and relies on active translation. In addition, we show that IRE1α-catalyzed splicing mobilizes XBP1 mRNA from the ER membrane in response to ER stress. Surprisingly, we find that XBP1 transcripts are not recruited into large IRE1α clusters, which are only observed upon overexpression of fluorescently tagged IRE1α during ER stress. Our findings support a model where ribosome-engaged, immobilized XBP1 mRNA is processed by small IRE1α assemblies that could be dynamically recruited for processing of mRNA transcripts on the ER.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates human IRE1α through reversible assembly of inactive dimers into small oligomers</a></h4>

              
                Protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated by a signaling network, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is an ER membrane-resident kinase/RNase that mediates signal transmission in the most evolutionarily conserved branch of the UPR. Dimerization and/or higher-order oligomerization of IRE1 are thought to be important for its activation mechanism, yet the actual oligomeric states of inactive, active, and attenuated mammalian IRE1 complexes remain unknown. We developed an automated two-color single-molecule tracking approach to dissect the oligomerization of tagged endogenous human IRE1 in live cells. In contrast to previous models, our data indicate that IRE1 exists as a constitutive homodimer at baseline and assembles into small oligomers upon ER stress. We demonstrate that the formation of inactive dimers and stress-dependent oligomers is fully governed by IRE1’s lumenal domain. Phosphorylation of IRE1’s kinase domain occurs more slowly than oligomerization and is retained after oligomers disassemble back into dimers. Our findings suggest that assembly of IRE1 dimers into larger oligomers specifically enables <i>trans-</i>autophosphorylation, which in turn drives IRE1’s RNase activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">What is next in African neuroscience?</a></h4>

              
                Working in Africa provides neuroscientists with opportunities that are not available in other continents. Populations in this region exhibit the greatest genetic diversity; they live in ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna; and they face unique stresses to brain health, including child brain health and development, due to high levels of traumatic brain injury and diseases endemic to the region. However, the neuroscience community in Africa has yet to reach its full potential. In this article we report the outcomes from a series of meetings at which the African neuroscience community came together to identify barriers and opportunities, and to discuss ways forward. This exercise resulted in the identification of six domains of distinction in African neuroscience: the diverse DNA of African populations; diverse flora, fauna and ecosystems for comparative research; child brain health and development; the impact of climate change on mental and neurological health; access to clinical populations with important conditions less prevalent in the global North; and resourcefulness in the reuse and adaption of existing technologies and resources to answer new questions. The article also outlines plans to advance the field of neuroscience in Africa in order to unlock the potential of African neuroscientists to address regional and global mental health and neurological problems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lipolysis of bone marrow adipocytes is required to fuel bone and the marrow niche during energy deficits</a></h4>

              
                To investigate roles for bone marrow adipocyte (BMAd) lipolysis in bone homeostasis, we created a BMAd-specific Cre mouse model in which we knocked out adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, <i>Pnpla2 </i>gene). BMAd-<i>Pnpla2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired BMAd lipolysis, and increased size and number of BMAds at baseline. Although energy from BMAd lipid stores is largely dispensable when mice are fed <i>ad libitum</i>, BMAd lipolysis is necessary to maintain myelopoiesis and bone mass under caloric restriction. BMAd-specific <i>Pnpla2 </i>deficiency compounds the effects of caloric restriction on loss of trabecular bone in male mice, likely due to impaired osteoblast expression of collagen genes and reduced osteoid synthesis. RNA sequencing analysis of bone marrow adipose tissue reveals that caloric restriction induces dramatic elevations in extracellular matrix organization and skeletal development genes, and energy from BMAd is required for these adaptations. BMAd-derived energy supply is also required for bone regeneration upon injury, and maintenance of bone mass with cold exposure.

                <b>Background:</b> Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for ~90% of all cases of diabetes, resulting in an estimated 6.7 million deaths in 2021, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Early detection of patients with high risk of developing T2D can reduce the incidence of the disease through a change in lifestyle, diet, or medication. Since populations of lower socio-demographic status are more susceptible to T2D and might have limited resources or access to sophisticated computational resources, there is a need for accurate yet accessible prediction models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perceptual restoration fails to recover unconscious processing for smooth eye movements after occipital stroke</a></h4>

              
                The visual pathways that guide actions do not necessarily mediate conscious perception. Patients with primary visual cortex (V1) damage lose conscious perception but often retain unconscious abilities (e.g. blindsight). Here, we asked if saccade accuracy and post-saccadic following responses (PFRs) that automatically track target motion upon saccade landing are retained when conscious perception is lost. We contrasted these behaviors in the blind and intact fields of 11 chronic V1-stroke patients, and in 8 visually-intact controls. Saccade accuracy was relatively normal in all cases. Stroke patients also had normal PFR in their intact fields, but no PFR in their blind fields. Thus, V1 damage did not spare the unconscious visual processing necessary for automatic, post-saccadic smooth eye movements. Importantly, visual training that recovered motion perception in the blind field did not restore the PFR, suggesting a clear dissociation between pathways mediating perceptual restoration and automatic actions in the V1-damaged visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogenic mutations in the chromokinesin KIF22 disrupt anaphase chromosome segregation</a></h4>

              
                The chromokinesin KIF22 generates forces that contribute to mitotic chromosome congression and alignment. Mutations in the a2 helix of the motor domain of KIF22 have been identified in patients with abnormal skeletal development, and we report the identification of a patient with a novel mutation in the KIF22 tail. We demonstrate that pathogenic mutations do not result in a loss of KIF22's functions in early mitosis. Instead, mutations disrupt chromosome segregation in anaphase, resulting in reduced proliferation, abnormal daughter cell nuclear morphology, and, in a subset of cells, cytokinesis failure. This phenotype could be explained by a failure of KIF22 to inactivate in anaphase. Consistent with this model, constitutive activation of the motor via a known site of phosphoregulation in the tail phenocopied the effects of pathogenic mutations. These results suggest the motor domain a2 helix may be an important site for regulation of KIF22 activity at the metaphase to anaphase transition. In support of this conclusion, mimicking phosphorylation of a2 helix residue T158 also prevents inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase. These findings demonstrate the importance of both the head and tail of the motor in regulating the activity of KIF22 and offer insight into the cellular consequences of preventing KIF22 inactivation and disrupting force balance in anaphase.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Highly Selective Response to Food in Human Visual Cortex Revealed by Hypothesis-Free Voxel Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                Prior work has identified cortical regions selectively responsive to specific categories of visual stimuli. However, this hypothesis-driven work cannot reveal how prominent these category selectivities are in the overall functional organization of visual cortex, or what others might exist that scientists have not thought to look for. Further, standard voxel-wise tests cannot detect distinct neural selectivities that coexist within voxels. To overcome these limitations, we used data-driven voxel decomposition methods to identify the main components underlying fMRI responses to thousands of complex photographic images (Allen et al 2021). Our hypothesis-neutral analysis rediscovered components selective for faces, places, bodies, and words, validating our method and showing that these selectivities are dominant features of the ventral visual pathway. The analysis also revealed an unexpected component with a distinct anatomical distribution that responded highly selectively to images of food. Alternative accounts based on low to mid-level visual features like color, shape or texture failed to account for the food selectivity of this component. High-throughput testing and control experiments with matched stimuli on a highly accurate computational model of this component confirm its selectivity for food. We registered our methods and hypotheses before replicating them on held-out participants and in a novel dataset. These findings demonstrate the power of data-driven methods, and show that the dominant neural responses of the ventral visual pathway include not only selectivities for faces, scenes, bodies, and words, but also the visually heterogeneous category of food, thus constraining accounts of when and why functional specialization arises in the cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine in the Dorsal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis signals Pavlovian sign-tracking and reward violations</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain and striatal dopamine signals have been extremely well characterized over the past several decades, yet novel dopamine signals and functions in reward learning and motivation continue to emerge. A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). The dBNST receives dense dopaminergic input from several regions including the ventral tegmental area, ventral periacqueductal gray, and substantia nigra. Here, we record fluorescent GRABDA signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task that has established individual differences in cue-evoked striatal dopamine signals in sign- and goal-tracking rats. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats. We find the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRABDA signals decrease immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected reward or omit expected reward, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered and self-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt dBNST cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. Fentanyl self-administration experience is sufficient to reverse reward seeking from food to fentanyl and dBNST dopamine signaling discriminates fentanyl-associated active vs. inactive lever pressing under extinction conditions. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.

                Understanding the main topic of naturalistic speech in a multi-speaker environment is demanding though the availability of visual speech can be beneficial for speech comprehension. Recent studies provided evidence that low-frequency brain rhythms play an important role in the processing of acoustic speech features. However, at present, the neural dynamics of brain rhythms implementing a higher-order semantic system during naturalistic audiovisual speech perception is unknown. Here we investigated information processing carried by low-frequency oscillations in delta and theta bands for audiovisual speech integration for high-level semantic gist processing using a representational interaction approach. By manipulating the degree of high-level semantic content (speech chunks with high versus low topic probability) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling algorithm and complexity of speaker environment (single versus multi-speaker), we first found that delta and theta phase exert distinctive roles in high-level semantic processing where delta phase represents auditory and visual inputs synergistically whereas theta band does so redundantly. Next, we show both forms of representational interaction are observed to be greater for speech with low semantic gist, supported by speech comprehension and white matter tractography. Furthermore, we show that the delta phase-specific synergistic interaction in the right auditory, temporal, and inferior frontal areas is sensitive to the speaker environment, whereas theta band activity showing redundant representations is sensitive to semantic content. Our results shed new light on dynamic neural mechanisms of implementing higher-order semantic systems through representational interactions between audiovisual speech information and differential roles of delta and theta bands depending on the speaker environment.

                Striatal dopamine released from the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons has been linked to a wide range of functions, including movement control and reward-based learning. Recent studies have reported functional signaling differences between axons and somas of dopamine neurons, suggesting that local modulation controls dopamine release and calling into question the classical view of somatic control. However, these experiments are technically challenging, making it difficult to ensure that axonal and somatic recordings come from the same neurons, particularly given the heterogeneity of dopaminergic cell types. Here we used genetic strategies to isolate key dopaminergic neuron subtypes and monitor their axonal and somatic signaling patterns in behaving mice. Contrary to the inferences drawn from previous studies, these experiments revealed a robust correlation between somatic and axonal signaling. Thus, by exploiting a previously unknown connection between genetic and functional diversity in dopamine neurons, we establish that subtypes must be considered to understand the mechanisms of dopamine release in striatum during behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal 4-Hz oscillations emerge during stationary running in a wheel and are resistant to medial septum inactivation</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies described 2-4 Hz oscillations in the hippocampus of rats performing stationary locomotion on treadmills and other apparatus. Since the 2-4 Hz rhythm shares common features with hippocampal theta (5-12 Hz) oscillations - such as a positive running speed-amplitude relationship and modulation of spiking activity - many have questioned whether these rhythms are related or independently generated. To answer this question, we analyzed local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity from the dorsal CA1 of rats executing a spatial alternation task and running for ~15 s in a wheel during the intertrial intervals both before and after muscimol injection into the medial septum. We observed 4-Hz oscillations during wheel runs, but not during maze runs. The 4-Hz amplitude positively correlated with wheel speed and negatively with maze speed. Also, the amplitude of 4-Hz and theta oscillations were inversely related. Medial septum inactivation abolished hippocampal theta but preserved 4-Hz oscillations. It also affected the entrainment of pyramidal cells and interneurons by 4-Hz rhythmic activity. In all, these results dissociate the underlying mechanism of 4-Hz and theta oscillations in the rat hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new cortical parcellation based on systematic review of primate anatomical tracing studies on corticostriatal projections</a></h4>

              
                Corticostriatal projections form the input level of a circuitry that connects the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Three distinct, functional subcircuits exist according to the tripartite model: Sensorimotor cortices projecting mainly to the dorsolateral striatum; associative cortices projecting to the dorsomedial striatum and limbic cortices projecting to the ventral striatum. However, there is to date no atlas that allows researchers to label cortical projection areas belonging to each of these subcircuits separately. To address this research gap, the aim of this study was threefold: First, to systematically review anatomical tracing studies that focused on corticostriatal projections in non-human primates, and to classify their findings according to the tripartite model. Second, to develop an atlas of the human cerebral cortex based on this classification. Third, to test the hypothesis that labels in this atlas show structural connectivity with specific striatal subregions in humans using diffusion-based tractography in a sample of 24 healthy participants. In total, 98 studies met the inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Information about projections from the cortex to the striatum was systematically extracted by Brodmann area, and cortical areas were classified by their dominant efferent projections. Taking known homological and functional similarities and differences between non-human primate and human cortical regions into account, a new human corticostriatal projection (CSP) atlas was developed. Using human diffusion-based tractography analyses, we found that the limbic and sensorimotor atlas labels showed preferential structural connectivity with the ventral and dorsolateral striatum, respectively. However, the pattern of structural connectivity for the associative label showed the greatest degree of overlap with other labels. We provide this new atlas as a freely available tool for neuroimaging studies, where it allows for the first-time delineation of anatomically informed regions-of-interest to study functional subcircuits within the corticostriatal circuitry. This tool will enable specific investigations of subcircuits involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear in action: Fear conditioning and alleviation through body movements</a></h4>

              
                Learning a predictive cue of a threat - threat conditioning - allows us to prevent direct contact with the threat. In animals, threat-conditioned cues induce fear-like body movements such as freezing. Interestingly, training animals with alternative bodily defenses to avoid harm could reduce conditioned fear-like responses, suggesting that the physical capacity to actively defend against a threat could help overcome passively induced fear. However, evidence for the role of body movements in acquisition and alleviation of human fear is scarce. In the present study, human participants showed a deviation of multidimensional body movement patterns as threat conditioning progressed in a naturalistic virtual setting. The subsequent training to exert defensive body movements to prevent harm weakened the conditioned body movements and resulted in a long-term (24 hrs) reduction of the physiological responses and subjective fear toward the conditioned cues. Unlike the passive extinction procedure, the training of defensive body movements was resistant to spontaneous recovery of a fear response. The alleviating effect of the active defense training was observed when participants physically defended themselves but not when they merely observed another person vicariously defending against a threat on their behalf. These results suggest the critical role of body movements in both acquisition and reduction of conditioned fear among humans. Further investigations may leverage more embodied procedures to advance mechanistic understandings and clinical interventions of human fear memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Covariations of cerebral blood volume and single neurons discharge during resting state and behavioral visual cognitive tasks in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                To better understand how the brain allows primates to perform various set of tasks, the ability to simultaneously record the activity of the brain at multiple temporal and spatial scales is challenging but necessary. In non-human primates, combined fMRI and electrophysiological recordings have not disentangle the contributions of spiking activity to the neurovascular response. Here, we combined functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and recording of single-unit activities (SUA) in visual and fronto-medial cortices of behaving macaques. We computed task-induced and SUA-induced CBV activation maps. We demonstrate that SUA provides a significant estimate of the neurovascular response below the typical fMRI voxel spatial resolution of 2mm3. Furthermore, our results also show that single unit and CBV activities are statistically uncorrelated during the resting states but correlate during behaving tasks. Conversely, during the resting states, CBV activities across known connected brain areas are correlated but decorrelate at the onset of the tasks as expected if participating in the default mode network (DMN). These results have important implications for interpreting functional imaging findings collected with fMRI or fUS while one constructs inferences of spiking activities during resting-state or while primates perform tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Surface Acoustic Wave Integrated Microfluidics for Repetitive and Reversible Temporary Immobilization of C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Caenorhabditis elegans is an important genetic model for neuroscience studies due to its unique combination of genetics, transparency, complete synaptic connectome, and well-characterized behaviors. These factors, in turn, enable analyses of how genes control connectivity, neuronal function, and behavior. To date, however, most studies of neuronal function in C. elegans are incapable of performing microscopy imaging with subcellular resolution and behavior analysis in the same set of animals. This constraint stems from the immobilization requirement for high-resolution imaging that is incompatible with behavioral analysis. In particular, conventional immobilization methods often lead to either irreversible, partial, or slowly reversible immobilization of animals preventing a multiplexed approach. Here, we present a novel microfluidic device that uses surface acoustic waves (SAW) as a non-contact method to temporarily immobilize worms for a short period (40 seconds). This device allows non-invasive analysis of swimming behavior and high-resolution synaptic imaging in the same animal. In addition, because of the low impact of this SAW approach, the device enables fast, repeated imaging of single neurons and behavior in the same animals for three to four days. We anticipate that this device will enable longitudinal analysis of animal motility and subcellular morphological changes during development and ageing in C. elegans.

                Pain therapies targeting the cannabinoid system are increasing with expansion of cannabis legalization but adaptations in the endogenous cannabinoid system during inflammatory pain could limit their efficacy. Presynaptic inhibition of GABA release mediated by cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonists in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is markedly reduced in male and female Sprague Dawley rats after persistent inflammation induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). Inflammation results in increased endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis and desensitization of presynaptic CB1Rs that is reversed by a GRK2/3 inhibitor, Compound 101. Despite CB1R desensitization, eCB activation of CB1Rs is maintained after inflammation. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) in naive animals is rapid and transient, but is prolonged in recordings after inflammation. Prolonged DSI is mediated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) indicating reduced monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity. These adaptations within the endogenous cannabinoid system have important implications for the development of future pain therapies targeting CB1Rs or MAGL.

                Spatially charting molecular cell types at single-cell resolution across the three-dimensional (3D) volume of the brain is critical for illustrating the molecular basis of the brain anatomy and functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has profiled molecular cell types in the mouse brain, but cannot capture their spatial organization. Here, we employed an in situ sequencing technique, STARmap PLUS, to map more than one million high-quality cells across the whole adult mouse brain and the spinal cord, profiling 1,022 genes at subcellular resolution with a voxel size of 194 X 194 X 345 nm in 3D. We developed computational pipelines to segment, cluster, and annotate molecularly defined cell types and tissue regions with single-cell resolution. To create a transcriptome-wide spatial atlas, we further integrated the STARmap PLUS measurements with a published scRNA-seq atlas, imputing 11,844 genes at the single-cell level. Finally, we engineered a highly expressed RNA barcoding system to delineate the tropism of a brain-wide transgene delivery tool, AAV-PHP.eB, revealing its single-cell resolved transduction efficiency across the molecular cell types and tissue regions of the whole mouse brain. Together, our datasets and annotations provide a comprehensive, high-resolution single-cell resource that integrates spatial molecular atlas, cell taxonomy, brain anatomy, and genetic manipulation accessibility of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"What" and "When" Predictions Modulate Auditory Processing in a Contextually Specific Manner</a></h4>

              
                Extracting regularities from ongoing stimulus streams to form predictions is crucial for adaptive behavior. Such regularities exist in terms of the content of the stimuli (i.e., what it is) and their timing (i.e., when it will occur), both of which are known to interactively modulate sensory processing. In real-world stimulus streams, regularities also occur contextually - e.g. predictions of individual notes vs. melodic contour in music. However, it is unknown whether the brain integrates predictions in a contextually congruent manner (e.g., if slower when predictions selectively interact with complex what predictions), and whether integrating predictions of simple vs. complex features rely on dissociable neural correlates. To address these questions, our study employed what and when violations at different levels - single tones (elements) vs. tone pairs (chunks) - within the same stimulus stream, while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) in participants (N=20) performing a repetition detection task. Our results reveal that what and when predictions interactively modulated stimulus-evoked response amplitude in a contextually congruent manner, but that these modulations were shared between contexts in terms of the spatiotemporal distribution of EEG signals. Effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling showed that the integration of what and when prediction selectively increased connectivity at relatively late cortical processing stages, between the superior temporal gyrus and the fronto-parietal network. Taken together, these results suggest that the brain integrates different predictions with a high degree of contextual specificity, but in a shared and distributed cortical network.

                The identification of behavior in video is a critical but time-consuming component in many areas of animal behavior research. Here, we introduce DeepAction, a deep learning-based toolbox for automatically annotating animal behavior in video. Our approach uses features extracted from raw video frames by a pretrained convolutional neural network to train a recurrent neural network classifier. We evaluate the classifier on two benchmark rodent datasets and show that it achieves high accuracy, requires little training data, and surpasses both human agreement and similar existing methods. We also create a confidence score for classifier output, and show our method provides an accurate estimate of classifier performance and reduces the time required by human annotators to review and correct automatically-produced annotations. We release our system and accompanying annotation interface as an adaptable, non-technical, and open-source MATLAB toolbox.

                Our continuous visual experience in daily life is dominated by change. Previous research has focused on the effects of visual motion, eye movements or the transition between events, but has failed to capture their full impact across the brain. Using intracranial recordings in humans, we investigate the neural responses to these sources of novelty during the natural experience of watching film. Responses to saccades and film cuts were much stronger than those to visual motion, extending far beyond traditional visual processing areas. Film cuts associated with semantic event boundaries elicit strong and specific responses in higher-order brain areas. Saccades associated with high visual novelty also elicit strong neural responses. Specific locations in higher-order brain areas show selectivity to either high or low-novelty saccade, as well as face or non-face targets. In summary, visual and semantic novelty drive much of the human brain, while exhibiting specialization to specific forms of novelty.

                The dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus is hypothesized to act as a pattern separator that distinguishes between similar input patterns during memory formation and retrieval. Sparse ensembles of DG cells associated with learning and memory, i.e. engrams, have been labeled and manipulated to recall novel context memories. Functional studies of DG cell activity have demonstrated the spatial specificity and stability of DG cells during navigation. To reconcile how the DG contributes to separating global context as well as individual navigational routes, we trained mice to perform a delayed-non-match-to-position (DNMP) T-maze task and tagged DG neurons during performance of this task on a novel T-maze. The following day, mice navigated a second environment: the same T-maze, the same T-maze with one route permanently blocked but still visible, or a novel open field. First, we found that novelty and memory demand yielded larger engram ensemble size. Additionally, the degree of engram reactivation across days differed based on the traversal of maze routes, such that mice traversing only one arm had higher overlap than chance but less overlap than mice running the full two-route task. These differences could not be fully explained by behavioral differences across groups on the second day. Together, these results support the hypothesis that DG contributes to spatial navigation memory and that partially non-overlapping ensembles encode different routes within the context of different environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social isolation produces a brain-region specific expansion of microglia structure and reorganization of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation is a profound form of psychological stress that impacts the mental health of a large proportion of society. Other experimental models of stress and injury have demonstrated microglia activation and alterations in neural activity. Microglia and neural activity undergo coordinated changes under physiological and pathological states. However, the effect of social isolation on microglia and neural activity has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we show that the dorsal medial hypothalamus and hippocampal CA2 region of male mice undergo an increased microglia volume and branching following social isolation, whereas females exhibit this increase in the hypothalamus only. The prefrontal cortex, central amygdala, nucleus accumbens shell, and visual cortex did not exhibit changes in microglia structure in either male or female mice. The home cage resting level of neural activity, as measured by the immediate early gene c-fos, was reduced in CA2 and the prefrontal cortex of female but not male mice following isolation. However, the co-variation in neural activity across brain regions was abolished in male but not female isolated mice. These data show that different brain regions undergo independent and dissociable changes in microglia structure and network activity following social isolation which may account for changes in cognition and behavior associated with this form of psychological stress.

                SARS-CoV-2 corona virus causes a multi-faceted and poorly defined clinical and pathological phenotype involving hyperinflammation, cytokine release. And long-term cognitive deficits, with an undefined neuropathological mechanism. Inflammation increases the activity of the kynurenine pathway, which is linked to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. We sought to determine whether the kynurenine pathway is impacted in patients with mild COVID-19, leading to elevated neurotoxic metabolites in blood, and whether such changes are associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum samples were taken from 150 patients and analyzed by ELISA and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. We found increased levels of kynurenine, quinolinic acid and 3-hydroxykynurenine in serum from patients with mild COVID-19, together with increased levels of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and neopterin. The levels of neurotoxic metabolites were significantly associated with key inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF. The COVID-19 risk-factor hypertension was associated with the highest levels of neurotoxic metabolites in plasma. These neuroactive metabolites could be part of the pathological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment during and post-COVID and should be explored as potential biomarkers for long-COVID symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-classical glycosylation determines intracellular trafficking of APP and Aβ production</a></h4>

              
                A primary pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is A{beta} deposition in brain parenchyma and blood vessels, the latter being called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Parenchymal amyloid plaques presumably originate from neuronal A{beta} precursor protein (APP), but vascular amyloid deposits' origins remain unclear. Endothelial APP expression in APP-knock-in mice was recently shown to expand CAA pathology, highlighting endothelial APP's importance. Furthermore, two types of endothelial APP-with and without O-glycans-have been biochemically identified, but only the former is cleaved for A? production, indicating the critical relationship between APP O-glycosylation and processing. Here, we analyzed APP glycosylation and its intracellular trafficking in neurons and endothelial cells. Although protein glycosylation is generally believed to precede cell surface trafficking, which was true for neuronal APP, we unexpectedly observed that APP lacking O-glycans is externalized to the endothelial cell surface and transported back to the Golgi apparatus, where it then acquires O-glycans. Knockdown of genes encoding enzymes initiating APP O-glycosylation significantly reduced A{beta} production, suggesting this non-classical glycosylation pathway contributes to CAA pathology and is a novel therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Breathlessness in a virtual world: An experimental paradigm testing how discrepancy between VR visual gradients and pedal resistance during stationary cycling affects breathlessness perception.</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The sensation of breathlessness is often attributed to perturbations in cardiopulmonary physiology, leading to changes in afferent signals. New evidence suggests that these signals are interpreted in the light of prior "expectations". A misalignment between afferent signals and expectations may underly unexplained breathlessness. Using a novel immersive virtual reality (VR) exercise paradigm, we investigated whether manipulating an individual's expectation of effort (determined by a virtual hill gradient) may alter their perception of breathlessness, independent from actual effort (the physical effort of cycling). Methods: Nineteen healthy volunteers completed a single experimental session where they exercised on a cycle ergometer while wearing a VR headset. We created an immersive virtual cycle ride where participants climbed up 100 m hills with virtual gradients of 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% and 12%. Each virtual hill gradient was completed twice: once with a 4% cycling ergometer resistance and once with a 6% resistance, allowing us to dissociate expected effort (virtual hill gradient) from actual effort (physical effort of pedalling). At the end of each hill, participants reported their perceived breathlessness. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the independent contribution of actual effort and expected effort to ratings of breathlessness (0-10 scale). Results: Expectation of effort (effect estimate {+/-} std. error, 0.63 {+/-} 0.11, p <0.001) and actual effort (0.81 {+/-} 0.21, p <0.001) independently explained subjective ratings of breathlessness, with comparable contributions of 19% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, we found that effort expectation accounted for 6% of participants' physical effort of pedalling and was a significant, independent predictor (0.09 {+/-} 0.03; p =0.001). Conclusions: An individuals' expectation of effort is equally important for forming perceptions of breathlessness as the actual effort required to cycle. A new VR paradigm enables this to be experimentally studied and could be used to re-align breathlessness and enhance training programmes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extensive topographic remapping and functional sharpening in the adult rat visual pathway upon first visual experience</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the dynamics of stability/plasticity balances during adulthood and how they are sculpted by sensory experience is pivotal for learning, disease, and recovery from injury. Although invasive recordings suggest that sensory experience promotes single-cell and population-level plasticity in adults, the brain-wide topography of sensory remapping remains unknown. Here, we investigated topographic remapping in the adult rodent visual pathway using functional MRI (fMRI) coupled with a first-of-its-kind setup for delivering patterned visual stimuli in the scanner. Using this novel setup, and coupled with biologically-inspired computational models, we were able to noninvasively map brain-wide properties (receptive fields (RFs) and spatial frequency (SF) tuning curves) that were insofar only available from invasive electrophysiology or optical imaging. We then tracked the RF dynamics in the chronic Visual Deprivation Model (VDM), and found that light exposure progressively promoted a large-scale topographic remapping in adults. Upon light exposure, the initially unspecialized visual pathway progressively evidenced sharpened RFs (smaller and more spatially selective) and enhanced bandpass filters in SF tuning curves. Our findings reveal that visual experience following VDM reshapes the structure and function of the visual system and shifts the stability/plasticity balance in adults.

	<p>Diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of neurological diseases are limited by the poor specificity and limited resolution of currently available techniques. Analysis of circulating cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has emerged as a promising strategy for the diagnosis, molecular characterization, and monitoring of neurological disease. In comparison to bulk sequencing analysis, single-cell sequencing studies can provide novel insights into rare cell populations and uncover heterogeneity in gene expression at a single-cell resolution, which has several implications for understanding disease pathology and treatment. Parallel development of standardized biofluid collection protocols, pre-processing strategies, reliable single-cell isolation strategies, downstream genomic analysis, and robust computational analysis is paramount for comprehensive single-cell sequencing analysis. Here we perform a comprehensive review of studies focusing on single-cell sequencing of cells in the CSF of patients with oncological or non-oncological diseases of the central nervous system.</p>

	<p>Background: The impairment of limb function and disability are among the most important consequences of stroke. To date, however, little research has been done on the early rehabilitation trial (ERT) after stroke in these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of ERT neuromuscular protocol on motor function soon after hemiparetic stroke. The sample included twelve hemiparetic patients (54.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 15.4 years old) with ischemic stroke (n = 7 control, n = 5 intervention patients). ERT was started as early as possible after stroke and included passive range of motion exercises, resistance training, assisted standing up, and active exercises of the healthy side of the body, in addition to encouraging voluntary contraction of affected limbs as much as possible. The rehabilitation was progressive and took 3 months, 6 days per week, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 hours per session. Fugle-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Box and Blocks test (BBT) and Timed up and go (TUG) assessments were conducted. There was a significantly greater improvement in the intervention group compared to control: FMA lower limbs (p = 0.001), total motor function (p = 0.002), but no significant difference in FMA upper limb between groups (p = 0.51). The analysis of data related to BBT showed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups (p = 0.3). However, TUG test showed significant differences between the experimental and control groups (p = 0.004). The most important finding of this study was to spend enough time in training sessions and provide adequate rest time for each person. Our results showed that ERT was associated with improved motor function but not with the upper limbs. This provides a basis for a definitive trial.</p>

	<p>Giant intracranial meningiomas (GIMs) are a subgroup of meningiomas with huge dimensions with a maximum diameter of more than 5 cm. The mechanisms by which a meningioma can grow to be defined as a &amp;amp;ldquo;giant&amp;amp;rdquo; are unknown, and the biological, radiological profile and the different outcomes are poorly investigated. We performed a multi-centric retrospective study of a series of surgically treated patients suffering from intracranial meningioma. All the patients were assigned on the grounds of the preoperative imaging to giant and medium/large meningioma groups with a cut-off of 5 cm. We investigated whether the presence of large diameter and peritumoral brain edema (PBE) on radiological diagnosis indicates different mortality rates, grading, characteristics, and outcomes in a multi-variate analysis. We found a higher risk of developing complications for GIMs (29.9% versus 14.8%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The direct proportional relationship between PBE volume and tumor volume was present only in the medium/large group (Pearson correlation with p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and not in the GIM group (p = 0.47). In conclusion, GIMs have a higher risk of developing complications in the postoperative phase than medium/large meningioma without higher risk of mortality and recurrence.</p>

	<p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the results of a novel dichoptic training program using an online platform in a group of subjects with refractive amblyopia, performing a comparative analysis of unilateral and bilateral amblyopic cases. For this purpose, a retrospective study analysis of data of 161 children (4&amp;amp;ndash;13 years) who underwent dichoptic treatment with the Bynocs&amp;amp;reg; platform (Kanohi Eye Pvt. Ltd., India) was performed. In all cases, the therapy protocol consisted of sessions of training of 30 min daily 5 times a week for 6 weeks. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the non-dominant eye improved significantly with the treatment, with a mean change of 0.39 logMAR in the whole sample (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Regarding binocularity, the binocular function (BF) score also experienced a significant improvement (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), with a mean change of 1.55 with therapy in the whole sample. The BCVA of the dominant eye only improved significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in the isometropic amblyopic subgroup. In conclusion, the use of the dichoptic therapy with the digital platform evaluated allows an effective restoration of visual acuity and binocular function in children with anisometropic and isometropic amblyopia.</p>

	<p>Objective: Sleep and eating behaviors are disturbed during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle in a significant number of reproductive-age women. Despite their impact on the development and control of chronic health conditions, these behaviors are poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to identify affective and psychological factors which associate with premenstrual changes in sleeping and eating behaviors and assess how they impact functionality. Methods: Fifty-seven women provided daily ratings of premenstrual symptomatology and functionality across two-three menstrual cycles (156 cycles total). For each participant and symptom, we subtracted the mean day +5 to +10 (&amp;amp;ldquo;post-menstruum&amp;amp;rdquo;) ratings from mean day &amp;amp;minus;6 to &amp;amp;minus;1 (&amp;amp;ldquo;pre-menstruum&amp;amp;rdquo;) ratings and divided this value by participant- and symptom-specific variance. We completed the statistical analysis using multivariate linear regression. Results: Low interest was associated with a premenstrual increase in insomnia (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05) and appetite/eating (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Furthermore, insomnia was associated with occupational (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), recreational (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), and relational (p &amp;amp;le; 0.01) impairment. Conclusions: Results of the present analysis highlight the importance of apathy (i.e., low interest) on the expression of behavioral symptomatology, as well as premenstrual insomnia on impairment. These findings can inform treatment approaches, thereby improving care for patients suffering from premenstrual symptomatology linked to chronic disease conditions.</p>

	<p>Foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a spectrum of neurological disorders whose neurological symptoms, besides the neuronal damage caused by alcohol, may also be associated with neuroglial damage. Tubulin-binding cofactor B (TBCB) may be involved in the pathogenesis of FASD. To understand the mechanism and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of FASD, acute foetal alcohol exposure model on astrocytes was established and the interference experiments were carried out. First, after alcohol exposure, the nascent astrocyte processes were reduced or lost, accompanied by the absence of TBCB expression and the disruption of microtubules (MTs) in processes. Subsequently, TBCB was silenced with siRNA. It was severely reduced or lost in nascent astrocyte processes, with a dramatic reduction in astrocyte processes, indicating that TBCB plays a vital role in astrocyte process formation. Finally, the regulating mechanism was studied and it was found that the extracellular signal-regulated protease 1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling pathway was one of the main pathways regulating TBCB expression in astrocytes after alcohol injury. In summary, after acute foetal alcohol exposure, the decreased TBCB in nascent astrocyte processes, regulated by the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, was the main factor leading to the disorder of astrocyte process formation, which could contribute to the neurological symptoms of FASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Single blind, randomized study comparing clinical equivalence of Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures for mucosal closure following surgical removal of mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar is a common dental anomaly, for which surgical extraction is required. Post-surgery closure of mucosa reduces the prevalence of pain and other surgery-associated complications. We compared tissue reaction/inflammation after 3 and 7 days of mucosal closure with Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures, following impacted mandibular third molar removal. Methods: This multicenter, prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized (1:1), single-blind study (July 2020-November 2021) included subjects (Trusilk®, n=65 and Mersilk®, n=64), requiring mucosal suturing following impacted mandibular third molar removal. The primary endpoint, incidence of pain, swelling and trismus at the extraction area on post-surgery day 3 and 7 was evaluated. The secondary endpoints, incidence of tissue reaction, wound infection, suture loosening, other complications, operative time, amount of anesthesia, intraoperative suture handling, time needed for complete wound healing and suture removal, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: Socio-demographic and intra-oral characteristics were comparable between the groups. In Trusilk® and Mersilk® groups, a gradually decreasing pain score, starting from day 0 post-surgery (42.17±22.38 vs. 45.97±22.20) to day 7 (8.40±11.93 vs. 8.28±12.13) to day 30 (1.98±0.89 vs. 1.75±0.76) was witnessed. After the surgery, 21.54% and 17.19% subjects in Trusilk® and Mersilk® groups, respectively, had no post-operative swelling, while at the last two visits none of the subjects had swelling. Non-significant difference in wound infection, suture loosening, wound healing, bleeding, taste changes, operative time, amount of anesthesia, intraoperative suture handling, and time needed for complete wound healing and suture removal was noted among the groups. No suture-related adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: The results indicated that the Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures are clinically equivalent and can be used for mucosal closure after removal of an impacted mandibular third molar with a minimal rate of pain, swelling and trismus.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The Mauthner cells are a pair of large reticulospinal neurons that organize sensory-evoked tail flip responses in fishes. An identifiable group of auditory "mixed" (electrical and chemical) synaptic contacts known as "Large Myelinated Club endings" on these cells have provided a valuable model for the study of synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain. While most of studies were performed in adult fish, we describe here methods that make possible recording synaptic transmission from these contacts in developing zebrafish, a genetically tractable vertebrate species which is uniquely amenable for combining synaptic physiology with live imaging and behavioral analysis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Universal Guide for Skull Extraction and Custom-Fitting of Implants to Continuous and Discontinuous Skulls</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide transcranial access to the brain. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naive animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails, if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs with constant material thickness along the skull curvature, e.g., to allow fixed screw lengths. We present a universal step-by-step guide for custom-fitting implants which overcomes these limitations. It is suited for unusual skull conditions, like surface discontinuities or irregularities and includes virtual bending as a process to match skull surfaces while maintaining implant thickness. We demonstrate its applicability for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multicomponent implant systems built on even or discontinuous skull. The guide uses only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. A detailed description of this process is available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions suitable for users without any prior knowledge in CAD programming. We report the experience with these implants over several years in 11 rhesus monkeys.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Biomarker of Photosensitive Epilepsy from Interictal EEG</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>People with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) are prone to seizures elicited by visual stimuli. The possibility of inducing epileptiform activity in a reliable way makes PSE a useful model to understand epilepsy, with potential applications for the development of new diagnostic methods and new treatments for epilepsy. A relationship has been demonstrated between PSE and both occipital and more widespread cortical hyperexcitability using various types of stimulation. Here we aimed to test whether hyperexcitability could be inferred from resting interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) data without stimulation. We considered a cohort of 46 individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy who underwent EEG during intermittent photic stimulation: 26 had a photoparoxysmal response (PPR), the PPR group, and 20 did not, the non-PPR group. For each individual, we computed functional networks from the resting EEG data before stimulation. We then placed a computer model of ictogenicity into the networks and simulated the propensity of the network to generate seizures <I>in silico</I> [the brain network ictogenicity (BNI)]. Furthermore, we computed the node ictogenicity (NI), a measure of how much each brain region contributes to the overall ictogenic propensity. We used the BNI and NI as proxies for testing widespread and occipital hyperexcitability, respectively. We found that the BNI was not higher in the PPR group relative to the non-PPR group. However, we observed that the (right) occipital NI was significantly higher in the PPR group relative to the non-PPR group. Other regions did not have significant differences in NI values between groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with the presence of cataracts in the Peruvian population older than 50 years: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cataracts are a public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where the greatest limitations of health care systems are observed, making access to treatment difficult. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the presence of cataracts in adults over 50 years of age in Peru. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical observational study was performed of data from the 2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES – acronym in Spanish). The dependent variable was the self-reported diagnosis of cataracts (yes or no). Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated using a generalized linear model of the Poisson family with a log link function to estimate factors associated with self-reported cataract diagnosis. Results: We analyzed the data of 8775 Peruvian adults older than 50 years; 1322 (16.68%) self-reported a diagnosis of cataract. A higher prevalence of having cataracts was associated with being aged 60-69 years (aPR: 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.61) and 70 years and older (aPR: 2.78; 95% CI: 2.44-3.18), identifying as being of native ethnicity (aPR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16-1.47), having undergone ophthalmologic evaluation in the last 12 months (aPR: 2.29; 95% CI: 2.07-2.53) and having diabetes mellitus (aPR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51). The prevalence of cataracts was lower in subjects belonging to the poorest wealth quintile (aPR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.43-0.70) and those with a higher level of education (aPR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.88). Conclusions: In Peru, one out of six adults older than 50 years self-reported a diagnosis of cataracts. People older than 60 years, being of native ethnicity, having had a visual acuity evaluation in the last 12 months and having diabetes were associated with a higher prevalence of cataracts. These factors should be considered when implementing strategies for health education, promotion and prevention to ensure access to early ophthalmologic care.

                E-wallet is an application that enable users to download payment cards using a mobile device. It is a new trend for consumers to use an e-wallet application to replace the traditional payment method. With E-wallet, a user does not need to bring cash or a credit card along with them. It enables users to make purchases in a more convenient way. Hence, this research analyses the factors that affect university students’ intention to use e-wallet. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) serves as the theory underpinning this research A total of 140 respondents from a Malaysian private institution participated in this study. Convenience sampling was used to select samples, and respondents completed the questionnaire using a Google form and a paper and pencil approach. The questionnaire was created using a nominal scale and a five-point Likert scale. Descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, and multiple regression analyses were utilised to analyse the data in this study. Students, supervisors, academics, researchers, learning institutions, commercial organisations, and the government will all benefit immensely from the data and information gathered from this study as we will be able to examine and understand the factors that influence students' decision to use an e-Wallet for their daily financial operations. This study, however, has certain limitations as it does not reflect the complete student population in Malaysian tertiary education and only examines four variables: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, and trust. Future studies could focus on other impacting elements such as risk, complexity, pervasive technology use and tech-savvy future generations.

                Background: Respiratory insufficiency is the most common cause of mortality among patients with a neuromuscular disease. Methods: We followed the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews. We explored the effects of high frequency wall compression and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, compared to a control intervention, on the lung volume and capacity, and quality of life in patients with neuromuscular disease. We further assessed the effects of these two interventions on clinical value, complications, and survival. The literature search was performed on 30/06/2020 in Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro and CINAHL on 6/07/2020. Inclusion criteria: patients with neuromuscular disease; interventions of interest mentioned above; randomised controlled trials comparing these interventions with a control intervention. Results: Five studies were included, and results were presented narratively. High frequency wall compression was not shown to be superior to standard care in terms of lung volume and capacity, quality of life, complications, and survival rate. Compared with standard care, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation showed non-significant differences in terms of lung volume and capacity, and the risk of respiratory infection. Standard care was nevertheless associated with a significantly higher risk of days of hospitalisation (Incidence Rate Ratio 8.5 [1.1-67]) and of antibiotic use than intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (Incidence Rate Ratio 43 [6-333]). The assessment with the risk of bias tool 2.0 showed a high risk of bias for all outcomes. Moreover, the evidence is of very low-quality for all outcomes. Conclusions: Due to large variety of reported outcomes, missing data and limited number of studies, no meta-analysis could be conducted. The results should be interpreted with caution as the results have a very low certainty of evidence and reported outcomes have a high risk of bias. The evidence for high frequency wall compression and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation is still insufficient to draw final conclusions. Registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42017064703.

                Background: Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is underdiagnosed and is difficult to detect. The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross‐sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: “Off” and “On” state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40–86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10-3). Conclusions: EncephalApp Stroop test was an efficient screening tool for CHE in Tunisian cirrhotic patients.

                Long QT syndrome is a genetically inherited heart disease caused by mutations in genes coding for the ion channels expressed in the heart cells. Like any other hereditary pathology Long QT Syndrome manifestations often start at a young age. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented a syncope after taking antidepressants, revealing a congenital long QT syndrome. The onset of cardiovascular symptoms in elderly subjects with such an unrecognized entity is very rare and is most often due to transient biological disturbances or to the use of certain drugs, which prolong the QT interval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus in East Java, Indonesia: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Diabetes mellitus has been perceived as the worsening factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where diabetes mellitus patients with pre-existing inflammatory condition could develop acute respiratory disease syndrome as well as multi-organ dysfunction. Managing diabetes mellitus amidst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is also a matter of concern as several antidiabetic therapies could affect the progression of COVID-19. This study aimed to provide the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus receiving blood glucose lowering therapies and COVID-19 symptomatic treatments. Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 260 medical records of patients hospitalized between May 2020 to February 2021 in East Java, Indonesia. Patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive based on the results from real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasal swab samples collected on hospital admission. Data included were demographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms, severity of COVID-19, comorbidities (other than diabetes mellitus), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and 2-hours post-prandial blood glucose (2hPBG), and outcomes. Results: Most of the patients had age range of 41–60 years old (76.1%) with more than a half of the subjects (60%) were obese. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes were distributed evenly among the COVID-19 severities (74.3% in asymptomatic group, 73.6% in mild group, and 74.1% in moderate group). There were reductions in FBG and 2hPBG levels measured before (210.75±81.38 and 271.19±100.7 mg/dL, respectively) and after the treatment (181.03±68.9 and 222.01±86.96 mg/dL, respectively). All patients received multivitamin and symptomatic treatment for COVID-19. Oral antidiabetic drug (57.6%) and insulin (28.8%) were administered to lower the blood glucose level of the patients. As many as 96.9% patients survived, while 3.1% died. Conclusion: COVID-19 could affect the blood glucose level, suggesting the importance of antihyperglycemic therapies among patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.

                Background: The involvement of the husbands in the issue of drug addiction has impacted the wives’ livelihoods. Due to drug addiction amongst husbands, the wives experience stress and strain. The Stress Strain Coping Support Model (SSCS) was established to better comprehend how coping influences stress and strain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the stress which refers to family impact experienced by the wives of drug addicts, in terms of economic difficulties and marital conflict, and mental wellbeing. Furthermore, this study examines the role of coping as a mediating factor between family impact and mental wellbeing. Methods: This study involved 132 wives of low-income drug addicts in Malaysia, who were selected using a purposive sampling method. Economic Strain Scale (ESS) and Braiker-Kelly Marital Conflict Scale (BKMCS) were used to measure family impact. Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale Short Form (CAPS-SF) and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) were used to measure coping and mental wellbeing of the respective respondents. Results: Path analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 showed that there is a direct association between family impact and coping, and between coping and mental wellbeing. The results also showed that family impact was associated indirectly with mental wellbeing through coping.  Conclusions: The findings benefited drug addict wives and practitioners related to this field in terms of enhancing the use of coping mechanisms in managing family impact and improving mental wellbeing, specifically amongst low-income drug addict wives.
