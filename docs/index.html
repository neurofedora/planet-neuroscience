              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156">Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.10156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR) and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10170">Exploring EEG Responses during Observation of Actions Performed by Human Actor and Humanoid Robot</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.

                arXiv:2407.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on a multi-modal imaging data application where structural/anatomical information from gray matter (GM) and brain connectivity information in the form of a brain connectome network from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are available for a number of subjects with different degrees of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a neurodegenerative disorder (ND) measured through a speech rate measure on motor speech loss. The clinical/scientific goal in this study becomes the identification of brain regions of interest significantly related to the speech rate measure to gain insight into ND patterns. Viewing the brain connectome network and GM images as objects, we develop an integrated object response regression framework of network and GM images on the speech rate measure. A novel integrated prior formulation is proposed on network and structural image coefficients in order to exploit network information of the brain connectome while leveraging the interconnections among the two objects. The principled Bayesian framework allows the characterization of uncertainty in ascertaining a region being actively related to the speech rate measure. Our framework yields new insights into the relationship of brain regions associated with PPA, offering a deeper understanding of neuro-degenerative patterns of PPA. The supplementary file adds details about posterior computation and additional empirical results.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06366">AI Agent Behavioral Science</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of AI agents that exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, including planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331">Aesthetics Without Semantics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly, aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06047">On Broken Symmetry in Cognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2303.06047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cognition is not passive data accumulation but the active resolution of uncertainty through symmetry breaking. This paper argues that both cognitive evolution and development unfold via sequential symmetry-breaking transitions that disrupt innate regularities across space, time, self, and representation. First, spatial symmetry is broken through bilateral body plans and neural codes like grid and place cells, which privilege egocentric orientation and localized encoding. Second, reinforcement learning introduces temporal asymmetry by favoring future rewards, establishing a directional flow of inference. Third, goal-directed simulation breaks spatiotemporal symmetry between internal self-models and the external world, enabling embodied inference and solving the combinatorial search problem. Fourth, social cognition via mentalizing and imitation breaks the symmetry between minds, allowing agents to infer others' beliefs. Finally, language imposes a linear, recursive structure onto unordered thought, breaking expressive symmetry through syntax and grammar. These asymmetries are unified by the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), which frames cognition as a cyclical entropy-minimizing process. At the core lies the principle of structure-before-specificity: ambiguous input is first mapped onto stable latent structures before being bound to specific instances. This promotes generalization, reduces sample complexity, and prevents overfitting. Inverting inference, from content back to context, further breaks the curse of dimensionality by constraining inference to goal-consistent manifolds. Thus, symmetry breaking is not incidental but the foundational mechanism by which cognition organizes, stabilizes, and scales intelligent behavior in an uncertain and dynamic world.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658">Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in ranking metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09781">Learning richness modulates equality reasoning in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.09781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different (SD) tasks have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in these models has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD tasks, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00533">RsGCN: Rescaling Enhances Generalization of GCNs for Solving Scalable Traveling Salesman Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor generalization for scalable TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a new Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges that influence the sensitivity of GCNs to the problem scales, a Rescaling Mechanism in RsGCN enhances the generalization capability by (1) rescaling adjacent nodes to construct a subgraph with a uniform number of adjacent nodes for each node across various scales of TSPs, which stabilizes the graph message aggregation; (2) rescaling subgraph edges to adjust the lengths of subgraph edges to the same magnitude, which maintains numerical consistency. In addition, an efficient training strategy with a mixed-scale dataset and bidirectional loss is used in RsGCN. To fully exploit the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design an efficient post-search algorithm termed Re2Opt, in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and Re2Opt, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on the mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across uniform distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

                <p>Regardless of discipline, quantitative literacy is a critical component of any scientist's skill set. A recent push from the NINDS has focused on enhancing and maintaining this expertise in trainees to enhance scientific fluency and to combat the reproducibility crisis. T32-funded programs often include off-campus retreats, providing opportunities to integrate a quantitative literacy component, or thematic focus. Here we will discuss the lessons and considerations learned from organizing a retreat focused on quantitative aspects of diagnostics for spinal cord injury. Survey results regarding retreat events and workshops reveal elements that were perceived to be successful by attendees. Events developed with active learning that focused on collaborative problem-solving and cross-discipline quantitative measures were well received by trainees. On the other hand, lectures and panel discussions were found to be less effective in boosting long-lasting improvements in quantitative literacy. Taken as a whole, these experiences from incorporating quantitative literacy into a T32 retreat offer strategies to consider when designing coursework or events focusing on this topic.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) receive synaptic input from a diverse range of neurons in the developing and adult brain. Understanding whether the neuronal populations that synapse with OPCs in the healthy brain is altered by demyelination and/or remyelination may support the advancement of neuroprotective or myelin repair strategies being developed for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To explore this possibility, we employed cre-lox transgenic technology to facilitate the infection of OPCs by a modified rabies virus, enabling the retrograde monosynaptic tracing of neuron-&gt;OPC connectivity. In the healthy adult mouse, OPCs in the corpus callosum primarily received synaptic input from ipsilateral cortical neurons. Of the cortical neurons, ~50% were layer V pyramidal cells. Cuprizone demyelination reduced the total number of labeled neurons. However, the frequency/kinetics of mini-excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from OPCs appeared preserved. Of particular interest, demyelination increased the number of labeled layer II/III pyramidal neurons and also increased at the expense of layer V pyramidal neurons, a change that was largely ameliorated by remyelination. These data suggest that in the healthy adult mouse brain, callosal OPCs primarily receive synaptic input from cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. However, callosal demyelination is associated with a population switch and OPCs equally synapse with layer II/III and V pyramidal neurons to synapse with OPCs, until myelin is restored.</p>

                Background Writing a medication prescription is a multifaceted skill expected of all junior doctors. However, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence after graduation. Separating the teaching of practical and clinical components may enhance understanding of the practical skills prior to integrating clinical knowledge to complete a prescription. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students, (2) evaluate knowledge retention a year later in the same participants as junior doctors, and (3) determine whether there is an association between self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript details the methods used in this novel longitudinal study. Methods This non-randomised pre-post longitudinal study will be conducted in two phases. The control group received standard curriculum-based education. The intervention was pharmacist-led multimodal education on prescription writing skills for final-year medical students. The intervention group completed the pre-post and follow-up tests. This study was approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H9114). Discussion This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded non-randomised longitudinal study to investigate the potential of pharmacist educators to improve prescribing knowledge and skills among final-year medical students in Australia. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potentially incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adherence to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study will review the effectiveness of and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long-term improvement in safe medicine practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

                Background Pilot errors and preconditions are major concerns that affected by multiple factors physiologically, psychologically and psychosocially. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between the internal and external risk factors, and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables divided into internal factors (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters); and external factors (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Results A total of 122 participants participated and 28.7% had an Unscheduled Flight Duty in the last 30 days. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-Cholesterol (95%CI=1.52–5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [Personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), Work-Related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI=(-0.479)–(-0.071)), Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), significant correlation was found between PR-Psychological Demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000–0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI=(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI=(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), Client-Related Burnout (95%IK=(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were Waist Circumference, HDL-Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Glucose, Personal Burnout, Work, and Client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the Number of Sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                <p>by Nuray Sogunmez Erdogan, Deniz Eroglu</p>

Mapping cell distributions across spatial locations with whole-genome coverage is essential for understanding cellular responses and signaling However, current deconvolution models aim to estimate the proportions of distinct cell types in each spatial transcriptomics spot by integrating reference single-cell data. These models often assume strong overlap between the reference and spatial datasets, neglecting biology-grounded constraints such as sparsity and cell-type variations, as well as technical sparsity. As a result, these methods rely on over-permissive algorithms that ignore given constraints leading to inaccurate predictions, particularly in heterogeneous or unmatched datasets. We introduce Weight-Induced Sparse Regression (WISpR), a machine learning algorithm that integrates spot-specific hyperparameters and sparsity-driven modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that neglect biology-grounded constraints, WISpR accurately predicts cell-type distributions while preserving biological coherence, i.e., spatially and functionally consistent cell-type localization, even in unmatched datasets. Benchmarking against five alternative methods across ten datasets, WISpR consistently outperformed competitors and predicted cellular landscapes in both normal and cancerous tissues. By leveraging sparse cell-type arrangements, WISpR provides biologically informed, high-resolution cellular maps. Its ability to decode tissue organization in both healthy and diseased states highlights WISpR’s practical utility for spatial transcriptomics, particularly in challenging settings involving noise, sparsity, or reference mismatches.

The success of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19 has opened new avenues for their application in oncology. In cancer immunotherapy, mRNA vaccines—typically encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 100–200 nm in size—enable delivery of tumor-specific antigens to activate immune responses. Here, we investigated the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in cancer by modeling tumor-immune interactions and tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics to identify predictive biomarkers. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we simulated tumor growth, immune cell dynamics, and vaccine pharmacokinetics in virtual cohorts of 1,635 patients generated via Latin hypercube sampling. Our simulations demonstrated a 45% average tumor size reduction and a 60% increase in CD8 + T cell infiltration in responsive tumors. Multiple regression analyses validated the predictive power of both pre- and on-treatment biomarkers. Key predictors of vaccine efficacy included antigen-presenting cell (APC) density and cytotoxic T cell fraction. Specifically, an APC density above 500 cells/mm³ in lymph nodes correlated with a 55% increase in vaccine response rates, while a cytotoxic T cell fraction above 20% in tumors was associated with a 60% reduction in tumor volume. A reduced M2/M1 macrophage ratio further improved treatment outcomes by 50%, highlighting the role of reprograming immunosuppressive macrophages. TME characteristics significantly influenced vaccine efficacy. Low extracellular matrix (ECM) density—modeled as a 5–10 × increase in hydraulic conductivity—combined with medium cytokine levels (IL-2 and TNF-α at 10–50 pg/ml), created optimal conditions for immune activation. Under these conditions, vaccine uptake improved by 35% and cytotoxic T cell infiltration increased by 65%, resulting in up to a 50% improvement in therapeutic outcomes. Model predictions aligned with pre-clinical data from melanoma and breast cancer models. These findings provide a framework for optimizing mRNA vaccine strategies and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.

                <p>by Karoline Horgmo Jæger, Aslak Tveito</p>

During each heartbeat, a voltage wave propagates through the cardiac muscle, triggering action potentials in approximately two billion cardiomyocytes. This electrical activity ensures the coordinated contraction of the heart, which is essential for its pumping function. A key event in this process is the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the cell membrane, allowing calcium ions to enter the cardiac dyad and triggering a large-scale release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. This process is fundamental to cardiac function because calcium subsequently binds to troponin, initiating the conformational changes necessary for myofilament contraction. The cardiac dyad is characterized by a very small volume with steep ionic concentration gradients, which is challenging for detailed mathematical modeling. Traditionally, the dyadic calcium concentration has been approximated using spatially averaged values or modeled with reaction-diffusion equations. However, at the nanometer (nm) and nanosecond (ns) scales, such approximations may be insufficient. At this resolution, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system provides a detailed continuous representation of the underlying electrodiffusion dynamics. Here, we present a nano-scale computational model, representing dyad dynamics using the PNP system. Potassium, sodium, and calcium channels are incorporated in the cell membrane, along with the sodium-calcium exchanger. We demonstrate the formation of the Debye layer in the resting state and highlight how both diffusive and electrical effects are required to maintain this equilibrium. Additionally, we show that cross-species ion interactions in the dyad are electrical, and that diffusion models fail to capture this effect. Finally, we illustrate how the dyad width and diffusion coefficient influence local ionic concentrations and the timing of calcium arrival at the ryanodine receptors. These results provide new insights into the electrodiffusive properties of the dyad and clarify when solving the full PNP system is necessary for accurate modeling.

Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a versatile tool to quantify cell-exerted forces by imaging and tracking fiduciary markers embedded in elastic substrates. The computations involved in TFM are often ill-conditioned, and data smoothing or regularization is required to avoid overfitting the noise in the tracked displacements. Most TFM calculations depend critically on the heuristic selection of regularization (hyper-) parameters affecting the balance between overfitting and smoothing. However, TFM methods rarely estimate or account for measurement errors in substrate deformation to adjust the regularization level accordingly. Moreover, there is a lack of tools for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to understand how these errors propagate to the recovered traction stresses. These limitations make it difficult to interpret the TFM readouts and hinder comparing different experiments. This manuscript presents an uncertainty-aware TFM technique that estimates the variability in the magnitude and direction of the traction stress vector recovered at each point in space and time of each experiment. In this technique, a non-parametric bootstrap method perturbs the cross-correlation functional of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to assess the uncertainty of the measured deformation. This information is passed on to a hierarchical Bayesian TFM framework with spatially adaptive regularization that propagates the uncertainty to the traction stress readouts (TFM-UQ). We evaluate TFM-UQ using synthetic datasets with prescribed image quality variations and demonstrate its application to experimental datasets. These studies show that TFM-UQ bypasses the need for subjective regularization parameter selection and locally adapts smoothing, outperforming traditional regularization methods. They also illustrate how uncertainty-aware TFM tools can be used to objectively choose key image analysis parameters like PIV window size. We anticipate that these tools will allow for decoupling biological heterogeneity from measurement variability and facilitate automating the analysis of large datasets by parameter-free, input data-based regularization.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003198">A unified framework to model synaptic dynamics during the sleep–wake cycle</a></h4>

Understanding synaptic dynamics during the sleep–wake cycle in the cortex is crucial yet remains controversial. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) suggests synaptic depression during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while other studies report synaptic potentiation or synaptic changes during NREM sleep depending on activities in wakefulness. To find boundary conditions between these contradictory observations, we focused on learning rules and firing patterns that contribute to the synaptic dynamics. Using computational models considering mammalian cortical neurons, we found that under Hebbian and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), wake-like firing patterns decrease synaptic weights, while sleep-like patterns strengthen synaptic weights. We refer to this tendency as Wake Inhibition and Sleep Excitation (WISE). Conversely, under Anti-Hebbian and Anti-STDP, synaptic depression during NREM sleep was observed, aligning with the conventional synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. Moreover, synaptic changes depended on firing rate differences between NREM sleep and wakefulness. We provide a unified framework that could explain synaptic homeodynamics under the sleep–wake cycle.

Diffuse large B cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas show recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators; among these are loss-of-function mutations in KMT2D and gain-of-function mutations in EZH2. To systematically explore the effects of these mutations on the wiring of the epigenetic network, we applied a single-cell approach to probe a wide array of histone modifications. We show that mutant-EZH2 elicits extensive effects on the epigenome of lymphomas, beyond alterations to H3K27 methylations, and is epistatic over KMT2D mutations. Utilizing the single-cell data, we present computational methods to measure epigenetic heterogeneity. We identify an unexpected characteristic of mutant-EZH2, but not KMT2D, in increasing heterogeneity, shedding light on a novel oncogenic mechanism mediated by this mutation. Finally, we present tools to reconstruct known interactions within the epigenetic network, as well as reveal potential novel cross talk between various modifications, supported by functional perturbations. Our work highlights novel roles for mutant-EZH2 in lymphomagenesis and establishes new concepts for measuring epigenetic heterogeneity and intra-chromatin connectivity in cancer cells.

Bacteria produce a plethora of natural products that are in clinical, agricultural and biotechnological use. Genome mining has uncovered millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode their biosynthesis, the vast majority of them lacking a clear product or function. Thus, a major challenge is to predict the bioactivities of the molecules these BGCs specify, and how to elicit their expression. Here, we present an innovative strategy whereby we harness the power of regulatory networks combined with global gene expression patterns to predict BGC functions. Bioinformatic analysis of all genes predicted to be controlled by the iron master regulator DmdR1 combined with co-expression data, led to identification of the novel operon <i>desJGH</i> that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the iron overload drug desferrioxamine (DFO) B in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. Deletion of either <i>desG</i> or <i>desH</i> strongly reduces the biosynthesis of DFO B, while that of DFO E is enhanced. DesJGH most likely act by changing the balance between the DFO precursors. Our work shows the power of harnessing regulation-based genome mining to functionally prioritize BGCs, accelerating the discovery of novel bioactive molecules.

Defining the subset of cellular factors governing SARS-CoV-2 replication can provide critical insights into viral pathogenesis and identify targets for host-directed antiviral therapies. While a number of genetic screens have previously reported SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors, most of these approaches relied on utilizing pooled genome-scale CRISPR libraries, which are biased toward the discovery of host proteins impacting early stages of viral replication. To identify host factors involved throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, we conducted an arrayed genome-scale siRNA screen. Resulting data were integrated with published functional screens and proteomics data to reveal (i) common pathways that were identified in all OMICs datasets—including regulation of Wnt signaling and gap junctions, (ii) pathways uniquely identified in this screen—including NADH oxidation, or (iii) pathways supported by this screen and proteomics data but not published functional screens—including arachionate production and MAPK signaling. The identified proviral host factors were mapped into the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, including 32 proteins that were determined to impact viral replication and 27 impacting late stages of infection, respectively. Additionally, a subset of proteins was tested across other coronaviruses revealing a subset of proviral factors that were conserved across pandemic SARS-CoV-2, epidemic SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and the seasonal coronavirus OC43-CoV. Further studies illuminated a role for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and found that inhibition of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway through targeting of BIRC2 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication both in vitro and in vivo. These studies provide critical insight into the landscape of virus–host interactions driving SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as valuable targets for host-directed antivirals.

     alt="Neural Repertoire Behind the World's Most Complex Retina: Neuroanatomy of the Stomatopod Lamina"/>
<p>The lamina behind the complex retina of mantis shrimp is highly conserved between eye regions and species and is similar to crustaceans and distinct from insects. Midband cartridges connect along columns, providing a neural basis for the unique scanning behavior of stomatopods.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lamina is the first optic neuropil and visual information integration station in crustaceans and insects, containing synaptic connections between photoreceptors and first-order interneurons. The lamina circuitry in mantis shrimp (stomatopods) is both interesting and complex, as there are 16 different types of photoreceptors contained within the mid-band region of the eye. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we have reconstructed photoreceptor terminals and lamina interneurons in two major superfamilies with different visual ecologies. Neurons follow the same general pattern as other crustaceans but with notable differences in gross anatomy from insects. The photoreceptors form bulbous terminals in the lamina, following the same overall connectivity pattern in all lamina cartridges across species examined and eye regions. The photoreceptor terminals themselves appear to be complex, with many large mitochondria, a notable difference between insects and stomatopods. Connectivity between photoreceptors and interneurons, as well as cross-cartridge connections, is estimated based on neuronal overlap. Lamina monopolar cells follow previous research in stomatopods and crustaceans, with a set of common neuron types that may provide the beginning of an opponency circuit. Additionally, neurons that extend beyond their parent cartridge in the midband show a preference for branching between rows within the same visual column of cells, as well as some connections within the same row. This added complexity suggests that the stomatopod lamina performs a unique processing of visual signals versus other crustaceans and insects and provides further evidence for the emerging hypotheses around the processing of information by the scanning visual system of stomatopods.</p>

                Children with ASD exhibit gastrointestinal comorbidity symptoms and have a higher susceptibility to IBD. In this study, rodent models were used to demonstrate that maternal VitD reshapes the immune status of offspring by altering chromatin accessibility and metabolic patterns of CD4+ T cells, thereby enhancing the response to intestinal inflammation.

                Transplants release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that disseminate donor antigens in lymphoid tissues, eliciting T and B cell allosensitization. Chen and Powell et al. demonstrate that natural IgMs bind graft EVs, activating complement. B cells relay complement-opsonized EVs to follicular dendritic cells that present the graft EVs to anti-donor B cells.

                Various RNA viruses induce expression of small non-coding vtRNAs during infection. Stok et al. show that vtRNAs promote replication of two distinct viruses. Using mass spectrometry, they uncover the vtRNA interactome, which includes ELAVL1 and hnRNP C. VtRNAs facilitate nuclear export of these proviral factors, which enhances viral replication.

They further show that disruption of Dlx1/2 alters inhibitory circuit development, linking specification of regional identity with postnatal thalamic dysfunction and behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Kooistra et al. demonstrate that airway stem cells are necessary to maintain functional IAMs. Specifically, basal cell-derived Notch signaling is required for MHC II expression by IAMs. Indeed, impaired crosstalk results in loss of antigen-induced inflammation. As such, human IAM-like cells may play a role in pathologic airway inflammation.

">Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Age-related declines in neuronal bioenergetic levels may limit vesicular trafficking and autophagic clearance of damaged organelles and proteins. Age-related ATP depletion would impact cognition dependent on ionic homeostasis, but limits on proteostasis powered by GTP are less clear. We used neurons isolated from aged 3xTg-AD Alzheimer's model mice and a novel genetically encoded fluorescent GTP sensor (GEVAL) to evaluate live GTP levels in situ. We report an age-dependent reduction in ratiometric measurements of free/bound GTP levels in living hippocampal neurons. Free-GTP co-localized in the mitochondria decreased with age accompanied by the accumulation of free-GTP labeled vesicular structures. The energy dependence of autophagy was demonstrated by depletion of GTP with rapamycin stimulation, while bafilomycin inhibition of autophagy raised GTP levels. 24 hr. supplementation of aged neurons with the NAD precursor nicotinamide and the Nrf2 redox modulator EGCG restored GTP levels to youthful levels and mobilized endocytosis and lysosomal consumption for autophagy via the respective GTPases Rab7 and Arl8b. This vesicular mobilization promoted the clearance of intraneuronal A{beta} aggregates and lowered protein oxidative nitration in AD model neurons. Our results reveal age- and AD-related neuronal GTP energy deficits that impair autophagy and endocytosis. GTP deficits were remediated by an external NAD precursor together with a Nrf2 redox modulator which suggests a translational path.

">GABA-independent activation of GABAB receptor by mechanical forces</a></h4>

              
                The heterodimeric GABAB receptor, composed of GB1 and GB2 subunits, is a metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA binds to the extracellular domain of GB1 to activate G proteins through GB2. Here we show that GABAB receptors can be activated by mechanical forces, such as traction force and shear stress, in a GABA-independent manner. This GABA-independent mechano-activation of GABAB receptor is mediated by a direct interaction between integrins and the extracellular domain of GB1, indicating that GABAB receptor and integrin form a novel type of mechano-transduction complex. Mechanistically, shear stress promotes the binding of integrin to GB1 and induces an allosteric re-arrangement of GABAB receptor transmembrane domains towards an active conformation, culminating in receptor activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shear stress-induced GABAB receptor activation plays a crucial role in astrocyte remodeling. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of GABAB receptor in mechano-transduction, uncovering a novel ligand-independent activation mechanism for GPCRs.

">Transcranial ultrasound stimulation modulates neuronal membrane potentials across broad timescales in the awake mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) offers noninvasive neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal precision, but its cellular-level effects in the awake brain remain poorly understood. Objective: We investigated how low-intensity TUS modulates membrane voltage dynamics in single cortical neurons in awake mice. Methods: Using the genetically encoded voltage indicator SomArchon, we performed high-speed kilohertz voltage imaging in awake head-fixed mice. TUS was delivered with a 0.35MHz transducer at 10 or 40Hz pulse repetition frequency with a 20% duty cycle, at intensities below the estimated threshold for auditory brainstem activation. We analyzed changes in membrane potential (Vm), spiking, and coordination across simultaneously recorded neurons. Results: TUS evoked rapid (<10ms) Vm depolarizations in 42.8% of neurons, while only 20.5% showed increased spiking, highlighting a direct effect of TUS on modulating synaptic inputs. Many neurons were entrained at both PRFs (20.8% at 10Hz; 12.7% at 40Hz) with Vm exhibiting significant phase-locking to individual TUS pulses. Vm entrainment was accompanied by increased temporal coordination across neurons and reset network synchrony. Furthermore, TUS-evoked cellular responses adapted over time, often transitioning from membrane depolarization to hyperpolarization upon repeated exposures, demonstrating prominent response depression. Conclusion: By resolving single-neuron responses, our results demonstrate that TUS directly activates individual cortical neuron with a latency shorter than 10 ms. TUS pulsed at physiologically relevant frequencies of 10 and 40 Hz robustly entrains neural dynamics, alters network coordination and evokes neuronal plasticity. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of designing TUS pulsing patterns to target specific neural circuit dynamics.

">Comparative Analysis of Test Tube and Volumetric Drinking Monitor Methods in Voluntary Ethanol Consumption in Female Mice for Prenatal Alcohol Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders affect approximately 1 in 20 school age children in the United States of America. To study fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, mouse models are commonly used. Of the many approaches of gestational exposure, voluntary drinking paradigms represent the most similar mechanism of drinking as human exposure. These exposures can be done through low-tech solutions such as test tubes (TT), or more high-tech methods such as a volumetric drinking monitor (VDM). Here were compare the TT method and the VDM directly, to evaluate their effect on female mouse drinking. Method: We adapted a drinking in the dark, active cycle, limited access (4 hr.) voluntary drinking paradigm first described by Brady et al. (2012) to test tubes and the volumetric drinking monitor. 8 mice were placed in either drinking method and we evaluated their drinking volume and blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). We compared the values for each group using t-tests. Results: After 2 weeks of drinking 10% ethanol with 0.4% saccharine, BACs were not significantly different [t(14)=0.2681, p=0.7935] between the VDM (81.56 {+/-} 21.16 mg/dL) vs.TT (73.14 {+/-} 23.20 mg/dL) groups. Calculated intake of ethanol (g/kg) on the day of blood draw for BAC analysis was also not significantly different [t(14)=0.4308, p=0.6732] between VDM (2.985{+/-} 0.4127) vs.TT (3.260 {+/-} 0.4863; Fig 1B) groups. Conclusions: Test tube or VDM resulted in similar average daily ethanol consumption and resultant BACs in female mice

">Species-specific oculomotor control tolerances predict saccadic suppression strength in macaques and zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Active sensing necessarily requires integrating information about both self-generated movements as well as past, present, and future afferent inputs1,2. However, such information is inherently variable and relies, at least in part, on uncertain extrapolations. Here, using saccadic suppression3,4 of visual sensitivity as a classic example of sensory-motor integration, we show that suppression strength in two drastically different species, macaque monkeys and zebrafish larvae, may be a direct outcome of efficient state estimation in the presence of uncontrollable sensory and motor variability. Bayesian estimator models5 suggest that optimal saccadic suppression should rely not just on the sensory-motor information being processed, but also on the time-dependent magnitude of unexplained variability in the nervous system encoding it. In both macaques and zebrafish larvae, and using matched visual stimulation regimes across the species, we experimentally measured saccadic suppression strength in the superior colliculus (SC) of the monkeys and the homologous optic tectum (OT) of the fish. We also experimentally quantified additive and multiplicative noise components in the motor systems of both species, and we furthermore estimated noise in the sensory systems. We found that inter-species differences in noise levels and their theoretically predicted impacts on visual sensitivity are qualitatively consistent with our experimentally observed differences in saccadic suppression strength between the fish and the monkeys. Because sensory and motor noise levels can reflect the amounts of available neural resources committed to a given task, our results strongly underscore the value of incorporating computational resource limits in investigating performance differences that have evolved in homologous brain areas.

">Estimating individual-level changes in functional brain connectivity and correspondence with topology changes</a></h4>

              
                With the rise of precision medicine and large neuroimaging datasets, measuring brain changes on an individual level becomes more possible and more important. However, functional connectivity has some mathematical and conceptual quirks that make estimating individual-level changes more complicated than, for example, estimating structural brain changes. Here, we compared six different change scores, i.e., metrics for quantifying change in functional connectivity, using a large sample with two time points, roughly 2 years apart, of low-motion data from the ABCD Study (N=2,719, ages 9-13 years). First, we compared distributions and potential interpretations of each metric. Then, we assessed how well different metrics captured topology change estimates by comparing them to individual-level changes in clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and network strength. As multivariate metrics may be more reliable than single connections and researchers often interpret connectivity changes in topological terms, this offers additional insight into the implications of change score choice. Overall, our analyses revealed widely different distributions between change scores that conferred vastly different results and interpretations of functional connectivity changes between time points. Thus, we provide recommendations for each change score and its optimal (or suboptimal) use cases, depending on the population, study design, and research question.

">Novel plasmalogen derivative KIT-13 restores neurological function in a mouse model of Rett syndrome by reducing neuroinflammation and restoring mitochondrial function</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders, including Rett Syndrome (RTT), have no functional cure and cause substantial levels of disability. Neuroinflammation is now strongly associated with both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, providing a strong rationale for development of novel therapeutics targeting common neuroinflammatory mechanisms. RTT is caused by mutations in the methylated DNA binding factor MECP2. Mecp2-deficient (Mecp2-KO) mice, which have been extensively characterized as a mouse model of RTT, exhibit high levels of neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and severe neurological symptoms similar to RTT patients. KIT-13 is a novel plasmalogen derivative being developed for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders including RTT. This study evaluated KIT-13 in both cell-based and in vivo models for its potential to inhibit neuroinflammation and address underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as effects on RTT-like neurological symptoms in the RTT mouse model. Oral administration of KIT-13 to Mecp2-KO mice significantly reduced neurological symptoms assessed by a composite score evaluating mobility, gait, hindlimb clasping, tremor, breathing, and general condition and improved the life span of the RTT model mice. In addition, KIT-13 suppressed mitochondrial DNA leakage associated with Mecp2 deficiency, and significantly suppressed neuroinflammation as measured by microglial cell morphology. These results suggest that KIT-13 may be a promising therapeutic agent for RTT and other neuroinflammation-related diseases.

">Validation of a combined cylindrical shield and partial-coverage mobile OPM system for detecting neuromagnetic sensorimotor responses in humans</a></h4>

              
                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have emerged as a promising technology for neuromagnetic recording in humans. Current state-of-the-art OPM systems are housed in immobile magnetically-shielded rooms to reduce external electromagnetic noise, and typically comprise sensor arrays covering the entire head. Here we sought to validate a low-cost, mobile OPM system comprising a small cylindrical mu-metal shield and partial sensor coverage. Twelve participants underwent right-sided median nerve stimulation (MNS) and cued right-handed button-pressing intended to elicit ubiquitous sensorimotor responses: somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs; comprising N20m, P35m and P60m components) and event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS) of oscillatory neuronal rhythms in the mu and beta frequency ranges. Following MNS, we observed robust N20m and P60m peaks, as well as the expected mu ERD and beta ERS effects. Moreover, we successfully localized these responses to expected cortical generators using distributed source modelling. SEFs and mu ERD were both maximal in left (i.e., contralateral to stimulation) primary somatosensory cortex (central sulcus, postcentral gyrus and sulcus), while beta ERS appeared more anteriorly, in the central sulcus and precentral gyrus. By contrast, results from the button-pressing paradigm were less conclusive - we observed beta ERS (but not mu/beta ERD), and an atypical distribution of the ERS effect over posterior ROIs. Overall, our findings provide proof-of-principle support for the use of our system in the context of passive (e.g., MNS) paradigms; its viability for cued movement tasks will require further development. Based on these results, we make recommendations for further developments in mobile and partial-coverage OPM.

">Advancing Fair and Explainable Machine Learning for Neuroimaging Dementia Pattern Classification in Multi-Ethnic Populations</a></h4>

              
                Dementia, a degenerative disease affecting millions globally, is projected to triple by 2050. Early and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved quality of life. However, current diagnostic approaches frequently demonstrate inconsistent precision and impartiality, particularly among diverse cultural groups. This study investigates performance discrepancies in dementia classification among White American, African American, and Hispanic populations. We reveal significant cross-group bias, particularly when models trained on one group are tested on another. To address this, we introduce a novel combination of few-shot learning and domain alignment to improve model adaptability across underrepresented populations. Our results show that these techniques substantially reduce inter-group performance gaps, especially between White American and Hispanic cohorts. This finding highlights the crucial need for fairness-aware strategies and the inclusion of diverse populations in training data to ensure accurate and equitable dementia diagnoses.

">Investigating the repeatability and behavioral relationships of acuity, contrast sensitivity, form, and motion perception measurements using a novel tablet-based vision test tool</a></h4>

              
                Visual function tests are important in basic and clinical vision research but are typically limited to very few aspects of human vision, coarse diagnostic resolution, and require an administrator. Recently, the generalizable, response-adaptive, self-administered Angular Indication Measurement (AIM) and Foraging Interactive D-prime (FInD) methods were developed to assess vision across different visual functions. The AIM and FInD paradigms show a range of visual stimuli per display (4x4 stimuli) spanning 2SD; around an adaptively estimated perceptual threshold across multiple displays. Here, we investigated the repeatability and behavioral relationships of the AIM and FinD paradigms for near visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function (CSF), form, and motion coherence threshold measurements using a novel tablet-based vision test tool. 31 healthy participants were recruited and repeated two repetitions of each experiment in random order. Bland-Altman analyses were performed to calculate the Coefficient of Repeatability (precision) and Mean Bias (accuracy). Linear regressions and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to investigate the relationship between outcome parameters. Results show that AIM Form coherence and FInD Form horizontal coherence showed significant retest bias; all other tests were bias-free. Cluster analysis revealed overall clustering of CSF, form and motion outcomes. We further show significant correlations within CSF and between motion coherence outcomes but few significant correlations between form coherence outcomes. AIM and FInD near vision tests are generalizable across multiple visual functions and are precise and reliable. Most functions tested were bias-free. CSF, form, and motion outcomes clustered together, and CSF and motion outcomes correlated with one another. The combination of a generalizable, response-adaptive, and self-administered approach may be a suitable set of tests for basic science and clinical use cases.

">Dynamics of cortico-subthalamic neuronal patterns during dyskinesia in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                People with Parkinsons disease suffer from levodopa-induced dyskinesia, adversely to chronic dopaminergic medication. These involuntary movements affect quality of life and are linked to lowered motor inhibition in the cortico-basal-ganglia motor network during hyperdopaminergic states. Several cortical and subcortical spectral biomarkers are associated with dyskinesia, but the oscillatory patterns associated with the behavioral complexity of involuntary movement and voluntary movement suppression that defines dyskinesia, is not studied so far. To elucidate these spatio-temporal dynamics and its behavioral relevance, we studied cortico-subthalamic oscillations in 21 Parkinsons patients during a dyskinesia-provoking experiment. We differentiated between non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic periods, and split data based on a kinematic movement registration, leading to respectively resting states and voluntary movement, and active movement suppression and dyskinetic movement. Elevated theta-activity and attenuated beta-activity was found in the subthalamic nucleus during voluntary movement suppression within dyskinetic periods, while cortico-subthalamic gamma-activity was only elevated during dyskinetic movement presence. Subthalamic spectral changes significantly predicted dyskinesia presence, and the amount of registered movement significantly affected the predictive value of dyskinesia predictions. We propose a dyskinetic macrostate to consist of distinct behavioral microstates of dyskinetic movements versus movement suppression, both associated with distinct oscillations in the cortico-subthalamic motor network.

">Heightened subcortical reactivity to uncertain-threat is associated with future internalizing symptoms, conditional on stress exposure</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anxiety, depression, and related internalizing illnesses are a leading burden on global public health, and often emerge during times of stress. Yet the underlying neurobiology has remained enigmatic, hindering treatment development. Methods: Here we used a combination of tools--including a well-established threat-anticipation fMRI paradigm and longitudinal assessments of internalizing symptoms and negative life events (NLEs)--to identify the neural systems associated with future internalizing illness in a risk-enriched sample of 224 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. We performed parallel analyses in an overlapping sample of 209 participants who completed a popular threat-related faces paradigm. Results: Here we show that heightened reactivity to uncertain-threat anticipation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the periaqueductal gray is associated with a worsening longitudinal course of broadband internalizing symptoms among individuals with low levels of NLE exposure. These associations were specific to uncertain threat and generally remained significant when controlling for concurrent measures of threat-elicited distress or psychophysiological arousal, highlighting the added value of the neuroimaging measures. Symptom trajectories were unrelated to amygdala and frontocortical reactivity to anticipated threat. Contrary to past research, amygdala reactivity to threat-related faces was unrelated to future symptoms. Conclusions: These observations provide a novel neurobiological framework for conceptualizing transdiagnostic internalizing risk and lay the groundwork for mechanistic and therapeutics research. A racially diverse, risk-enriched sample and pre-registered, best-practices approach enhance confidence in the robustness and translational relevance of these results.

">Integration of Audiovisual Motion in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is well recognized for its role in cognitive functions and activating action plans. In contrast, the properties of prefrontal neurons with respect to multisensory processing are less well studied. To address this question, we recorded single units from areas 8a and 46 of two female rhesus macaques while they were presented with visual, auditory, and audiovisual motion stimuli. The majority of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons responded to these sensory stimuli, with similar percentages of auditory-only, visual-only and audiovisual neurons. Approximately one third of responsive neurons exhibited significant super- or sub-additive interactions in response to the pairing of auditory and visual stimuli, revealing significant nonlinearities in their response profiles. Decoding motion signals from the population activity robustly differentiated multisensory from unisensory trials and also unisensory auditory and visual trials from each other. These results demonstrate that dorsolateral prefrontal neurons integrate auditory and visual motion signals, extending multisensory computations beyond sensory cortices into prefrontal circuits that support higher-order cognition.

">NDR kinase SAX-1 controls dendrite branch-specific elimination during neuronal remodeling in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal remodeling is crucial for proper nervous system development and function, and can be initiated by developmental programs, activity-dependent mechanisms, or stress. Despite significant advances, the underlying mechanisms that govern this process remain poorly understood. Here, we adapted C. elegans IL2 sensory dendrites as a model system to study developmental and stress-mediated dendrite pruning. Upon entering a stress-induced developmental diapause, IL2 dendrites grow a complex dendritic arbor, which is later pruned when reproductive development resumes. We identified unexpected specificity in the pruning process, with distinct genetic requirements to direct branch-specific elimination of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary branches. The serine/threonine kinase SAX-1/NDR promotes elimination of secondary and tertiary, but not quaternary, dendrites. SAX-1 functions with its conserved interactors SAX-2/Furry and MOB-2 in the removal of both dendritic branches. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor RABI-1/Rabin8 and the small GTPase RAB-11.2 mediate the elimination of secondary branches with SAX-1, but their effect on tertiary branches is minimal. Consistent with the known roles of RABI-1 and RAB-11.2 in regulating membrane dynamics, we find that SAX-1 promotes endocytosis during remodeling. Together, our findings reveal distinct mechanisms for branch-specific elimination under stress-induced and developmentally regulated neuronal remodeling.

">ATF4 activates a transcriptional program that chronically suppresses mTOR activity promoting neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease models</a></h4>

              
                The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a cell signaling pathway that enables cells to adapt to diverse cellular stresses. Conversely, during chronic/unmitigated cellular stress the ISR becomes maladaptive and has been implicated in a range of neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinsons Disease (PD). However, the mechanisms by which maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling contributes to neurodegeneration have not been elucidated. In this study we establish a critical mechanism by which chronic ISR activation becomes maladaptive and promotes neurodegeneration in neurotoxin and a-synucleinopathy models of PD in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we demonstrate that chronic activation of ATF4, the central transcription factor of the ISR, promotes neurodegeneration by regulating the transcriptional induction of SESN2, DDIT4 and Trib3 that co-operate to suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATF4-mediated suppression of mTORC1/2 activity promotes dopaminergic neuronal death in PD models by facilitating the activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein PUMA. Taken together, we have discovered a novel maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling pathway leading to chronic suppression of mTORC1/2 activity resulting in PUMA-mediated neuronal death that may have therapeutic implications in a range of neurodegenerative conditions that exhibit chronic ISR activation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) represents spontaneous neural activity and is increasingly analyzed using nonlinear measures to assess brain complexity. The Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) is a widely used metric for quantifying the fractal properties of EEG signals, yet its developmental trajectory remains largely unexplored. In this study, we examined age-related changes in HFD across childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. We analyzed eyes-closed rs-EEG from 128 channels in 83 neurotypical participants (8 to 30 yr) from the MIPDB database. To assess developmental patterns, we applied a Gaussian Linear Mixed Model with age, electrode location, and their interaction as predictors, alongside non-parametric cluster-based permutation analysis to evaluate topographical differences. We observed a significant increase in HFD with age (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.001), most pronounced between childhood and adolescence, followed by stabilization in early adulthood. HFD also varied across electrode locations, with higher values in frontal, central, and temporal regions and lower values in parietal and occipital areas. These findings provide new insights into the maturation of neural complexity in rs-EEG, aligning with known structural and functional changes in brain development. This study contributes to the growing body of research on nonlinear EEG dynamics and their relevance to neurodevelopment.</span>

                <p>The nature of motor deficits in Parkinson disease (PD) and aspects of their improvements with &#x029F;-DOPA replacement therapy (LDRT) offer potential insights into striatal dopamine actions. The defining and most LDRT responsive feature of PD, bradykinesia, is a complex phenomenon exhibiting impairments of both simple and complex limb movements. LDRT significantly remediates the former but not the latter. LDRT pharmacodynamics has two major components, the Short Duration Response (SDR), with a time course of seconds to minutes, and the Long Duration Response (LDR), with a time course of days to weeks. LDRT pharmacodynamics suggests different striatal dopamine actions on different time scales. While many studies used PD subjects to investigate striatal dopamine actions, few take LDRT pharmacodynamics into account. Correlating bradykinesia features and LDRT pharmacodynamics with our present understanding of striatal dopamine actions suggests that LDRT failure to improve complex movement performance reflects loss of phasic dopaminergic signaling. The SDR is likely a result of partially restored tonic/volume striatal dopamine neurotransmission. There is no existing explanation for the LDR. Recent experiments isolating the LDR cast doubt on prior accounts of how LDRT remediates bradykinesia. Interactions between the SDR and LDR may give rise to novel properties. Longer duration effects of striatal dopaminergic signaling need to be incorporated into studies of striatal dopamine actions in both preclinical and clinical experiments. Careful studies of PD bradykinesia and LDRT pharmacodynamics offer potential avenues for future explorations of striatal dopamine actions. Systematic preclinical experiments are needed to optimize design of clinical experiments.</p>

                <p>Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus pesticide used extensively in agricultural and residential settings for nearly 60 years. Gestational, subacute exposure to chlorpyrifos is linked to increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal studies have modeled these neurobehavioral detriments; however, the functional alterations in the brain induced by this exposure remain largely unknown. To address this, we used a rat model of gestational chlorpyrifos exposure to interrogate the alterations in the developing somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Rat dams were exposed to chlorpyrifos (5&nbsp;mg/kg) or vehicle on gestational days 18&ndash;21 via subcutaneous injection, with no overt acute toxicity. Acetylcholinesterase was modestly inhibited but returned to baseline levels by postnatal day 12. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on postnatal days 12&ndash;20 in both male and female progeny of the treated dams. A spike timing-dependent plasticity protocol revealed changes to the normal development of use-dependent plasticity, including interference in long-term synaptic depression. Recording inhibitory synaptic activity revealed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents and in paired-pulse ratios, in conjunction with a significant decrease in miniature postsynaptic currents. These findings suggest a presynaptic mechanism of inhibited GABA release, with potential disinhibition of inhibitory neurons. Evaluation of barrel cortex development displayed disruptions to normal barrel field patterning, with increases in both the septal area and total barrel field. We provide evidence for functional and structural alterations during brain development induced by in utero exposure to the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos that may account for the well-established behavioral outcomes.</p>

                <p>How does our brain transform when we encounter a new task? To fully answer this question, comparing brain states before and after learning may not be enough, but rather an ongoing, continuous monitoring of brain changes during learning is required. While such continuous examinations of functional learning-induced changes are widely available using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a continuous investigation of diffusion-detected brain modifications during learning is yet to be reported. Here, we continuously acquire diffusion MRI images during task performance. We then compute the mean diffusivity (MD) using a sliding-window approach, resulting in a continuous measure of diffusivity changes throughout learning. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a motor sequence learning (finger tapping) task (<I>n</I> = 58, 30 females). MD decrease was detected in task-related brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampus, inferior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Analysis of the temporal patterns of decrease revealed a rapid MD reduction in the right temporal gyrus after 11&nbsp;min of training, with additional decrease in the right PHG and left cerebellum after 22&nbsp;min. We further computed "neuroplasticity networks" of brain areas showing similar change patterns and detected similarities between these networks and canonical functional connectivity networks. Our findings offer novel insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diffusion-detected neuroplasticity by demonstrating continuous modifications during the encoding phase of learning itself rather than comparing pre- and postlearning states.</p>

                <p>Over the course of development, functional sensory representations emerge in the visual cortex. Prior to eye opening, modular patterns of spontaneous activity form long-range networks that may serve as a precursor for mature network organization. Although the spatial structure of these networks has been well studied, their temporal features, which may contribute to their continued plasticity and development, remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we imaged hours of spontaneous network activity in the visual cortex of developing ferrets of both sexes utilizing a fast calcium indicator (GCaMP8m) and wide-field imaging at high temporal resolution (50&nbsp;Hz). The spatial structure of this activity was highly modular, exhibiting distributed and spatially segregated active domains and long-range correlated networks on the timescale of tens of milliseconds. We found that the majority of events showed a clear dynamic component in which the patterns of active modules shifted over the course of events lasting a few hundred milliseconds. Although only a minority of events were well fit with a linear traveling wave, more complex spatiotemporal patterns occurred in repeated and stereotyped motifs across hours of imaging. Finally, we found that the most frequently occurring single-frame spatial activity patterns were predictive of future activity and separable spatiotemporal trajectories extending over many hundreds of milliseconds. Together, our results demonstrate that spontaneous activity in the early developing cortex exhibits a stereotyped spatiotemporal structure on fast timescales, suggesting a potential role in the maturation and refinement of future functional representations.</p>

                <p>Feelings of cognitive fatigue emerge through repeated mental exertion and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, there is a limited understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the influence of cognitive fatigue on decisions to exert. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants (18 females, 10 males) chose to exert effort for reward, before and after bouts of fatiguing cognitive exertion. We found that when participants became cognitively fatigued, they were more likely to choose to forgo higher levels of reward for more effort. We describe a mechanism by which signals related to cognitive exertion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex influence effort value computations, instantiated by the insula, thereby influencing an individual's decisions to exert while fatigued. Our results suggest that cognitive fatigue plays a critical role in decisions to exert effort and provides a mechanistic link through which information about cognitive state shapes effort-based choice.</p>

                <p>The human ability to track overlapping and asynchronous time intervals is crucial for a myriad of tasks, from engaging in conversation to driving a car. Additionally, unexpected events can trigger rapid, on-the-fly adjustments, necessitating quick updating of both timing intervals and action planning. Such events require immediate recalibration of decision variables to allow the system to promptly adapt to new stimuli and update the timing mechanisms accordingly. In this study, we assessed human male and female participants&rsquo; ability to track two simultaneous and asynchronous beep trains and determine which one ended first. Due to the stochastic nature of the beeps, participants frequently had to reorient their intended actions in order to identify which train was more likely to have ended. We found that they were able to do this accurately, demonstrating timing performance that was comparable with that of a single train. At the neural level, we recorded slowly evolving EEG potentials that encoded a single interval, the one associated with the currently intended action. Upon an intention switch, when participants had to reorient to a previously unintended action, the EEG response amplitude was reset to reflect the new intended interval. In contrast, when participants were instructed to disregard one of the beep trains, EEG responses solely reflected the intervals of the sequence they attended to. This flexibility in response highlights the brain's ability to dynamically reconfigure cognitive processes in real time, ensuring that actions remain contextually appropriate despite sudden changes in the environment.</p>

                <p>The ability to form decisions is a foundational cognitive function which is impaired across many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Understanding the neural processes underpinning clinical deficits may provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of decision-making. The N2c has been identified as an EEG signal indexing the efficiency of early target selection, which subsequently influences the timing of perceptual reports through modulating neural evidence accumulation rates. Evidence for the contribution of the N2c to human decision-making however has thus far come from correlational research in neurologically healthy individuals. Here, we capitalized on the superior temporal resolution of EEG to show that unilateral brain lesions in male and female humans were associated with specific deficits in both the timing and strength of the N2c in the damaged hemisphere, with corresponding deficits in the timing of perceptual reports contralaterally. The extent to which the N2c influenced clinical deficits in perceptual reporting speed depended on neural rates of evidence accumulation. This work provides causal evidence that the N2c indexes an early, hemisphere-specific process supporting human decision-making. This noninvasive EEG marker could be used to monitor novel approaches for remediating clinical deficits in perceptual decision-making across a range of brain disorders.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have found that several neurochemicals are involved in formation of pair bonding. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying pair bonding, especially how these chemicals interact in this circuit to regulate pair bonding, remain unclear. Using male mandarin voles, the present study shows that cohabitation with a partner increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) oxytocin (OT) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Optogenetic activation of PVN OT neurons projecting to the NAc shell reduced the activity of D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) but increased the activity of D1 MSNs in the NAc shell. Bath application of OT caused a long-term depression (LTD) of evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) in NAc shell D1/D2 MSNs in the noncohabitated male voles. This OT-induced LTD in the NAc shell D1/D2 MSNs was suppressed by 7&nbsp;d of cohabitation. NAc shell oxytocin receptor (OTR) MSNs projecting to the ventral pallidum (VP) were D1R/D2R positive. Chemogenetic activation or inhibition of OTR MSNs in the NAc shell projecting to the VP facilitated or disrupted the pair bond formation, respectively. The facilitatory effects of OTR MSN activation on pair bond formation could be blocked by D2 antagonist, but not D1 antagonist. These results suggest that OT and OTR neurons in the PVN&ndash;NAc shell&ndash;VP circuit regulate pair bonding via different activities of D1/D2 MSNs.</p>

                <p>Research on feature-based attention has shown that selecting a specific visual feature (e.g., the color red) results in enhanced processing in early visual cortex, providing the neural basis for the efficient identification of relevant features in many everyday tasks. However, many situations require the selection of entire feature ranges instead of just a single feature value, and recent accounts have proposed that broadly tuned attentional templates are often critical for guiding selection in cluttered visual scenes. To assess the neural implementation of such broad tuning of feature-based attention, we here recorded frequency-tagged potentials in human observers (male and female) while participants attended to narrow or broad ranges of colors of spatially intermingled dot fields. Our results show clear increases in the signal strength for the attended colors relative to unattended colors for both narrow and broad color ranges, though this increase was reduced for the broad-range condition, suggesting that limits in the breadth of attentional tuning arise at early processing stages. Overall, the present findings indicate that feature-selective attention can amplify multiple contiguous color values in early visual cortex, shedding light onto the neural mechanisms underlying broad search templates. More generally, they illustrate how feature-based attention can dynamically "zoom in" and "zoom out" in feature space, mirroring models of spatial attention.</p>

                <p>Dopamine modulation of the basal ganglia differs in males and females and is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, including some, like Tourette syndrome (TS) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that have marked sex differences in prevalence. Genetic studies in TS and subsequent work in animals suggest that a loss of histamine may contribute to dysregulation of dopamine. Motivated by this, we characterized the modulation of striatal dopamine by histamine, using microdialysis, targeted pharmacology, and shRNA knockdown of histamine receptors. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) histamine reduced striatal dopamine in male mice, replicating previous work. In contrast, and unexpectedly, ICV histamine increased striatal dopamine in females. ICV or targeted infusion of agonists revealed that the effect in males depends on H2R receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Knockdown of H2R in SNc GABAergic neurons abrogated the effect, identifying these cells as a key locus of histamine's regulation of dopamine in males. In females, however, H2R had no discernible role; instead, H3R agonists in the striatum increased striatal dopamine. Strikingly, the effect of histamine on dopamine in females was modulated by the estrous cycle, appearing only in proestrus, when estrogen levels are high, and estrus. These findings confirm the regulation of striatal dopamine by histamine but identify marked sex differences in and estrous modulation of this effect. These findings may shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of sex differences in the striatal circuitry and in several neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p>The chemokine CXCL12 is a highly conserved peptide that regulates homeostatic processes in the brain throughout life. Recent work shows that CXCL12 increases dendritic spine density in cortical neurons, which requires activation of CXCL12's receptor CXCR4. This same pathway reverses cortical dendritic spine deficits and cognitive impairment in an animal model of neuroHIV. However, it remained unclear if CXCL12 simply preserved existing spines or also engaged spine plasticity processes that drove network-level adaptations. We therefore tested if CXCL12 could regulate dendritic spine turnover, maturation, clustering, and neuronal network activity in primary rat cortical neurons of either sex using live-cell imaging, confocal microscopy, and multielectrode arrays. Intriguingly, CXCL12-treated neurons formed significantly more new spines than controls, and this outcome was blocked by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. CXCL12 also increased the density of thin spines expressing postsynaptic markers, including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), phospho-PSD-95<sup>Ser295</sup>, and GluA1, and allowed neurons to better maintain synaptic PSD-95 puncta size. Thin spines were modestly closer together after CXCL12 treatment, suggesting a possible effect on anatomical spine clustering. These effects translated to structured network activity, as CXCL12 increased spike frequency within network bursts in multielectrode array cultures. Finally, a targeted knockdown of CXCR4 in inhibitory neurons, which mostly lack dendritic spines, prevented CXCL12 from increasing spine density on excitatory neurons. Overall, our findings suggest CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling engages inhibitory neurons along with multiple aspects of spine dynamics and remodeling to shape how broader neuronal networks function.</p>

                <p>In humans, mutations or deletions of atypical FAT cadherin genes are linked to autism spectrum disorder and cerebellar ataxia. However, their large genomic size and the enormous size of their encoded proteins have hampered functional studies, leaving the roles of FAT cadherins poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated FAT2&mdash;an atypical cadherin selectively expressed in cerebellar granule cells&mdash;in murine cerebellar function. We demonstrate that FAT2 directly binds Cbln1, a secreted molecule essential for synapse formation and plasticity at Purkinje cell synapses. Furthermore, <I>Fat2</I> deletion mice of both sexes selectively weakened the synaptic strength of parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellum and impaired motor behaviors. These findings reveal that FAT2 is indispensable for motor behaviors, likely through regulating Cbln1-dependent synaptic integrity.</p>

                <p>Recognition of a familiar object in a novel location requires retrieval of the former object&ndash;place association and encoding of novel information. Such object-in-place (OiP) memory recruits a neural network including the hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (NRe); however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not understood. Locus ceruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons signal novelty; thus here we focused on the contribution of LC&ndash;forebrain projections and noradrenaline (NA) receptor subtypes to OiP encoding compared with retrieval, using an arena-based OiP task in male rats. The NRe was found to receive a catecholaminergic input from LC, with the strongest innervation directed to rostral NRe. Interestingly optogenetic inactivation of the LC-&gt;NRe pathway impaired OiP retrieval but was without effect on encoding, while inactivation of the LC-&gt;HPC selectively impaired encoding. Consistent with this double dissociation, pharmacological blockade of NRe &alpha;1-adrenoreceptors selectively impaired memory retrieval, while blockade of HPC &beta;-adrenoreceptors impaired encoding. Finally, pharmacological attenuation of noradrenergic signaling in the NRe and HPC through the infusion of the &alpha;2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK 14,304 impaired retrieval and encoding, respectively. Surprisingly, antagonism or agonism of adrenoreceptor subtypes in the mPFC had no effect on memory performance. Together these results reveal the importance of NA within the HPC and NRe for OiP, whereby selectivity of function is achieved via spatially distinct LC output projections and NA receptor subtypes consistent with a modular view of NA function. These results are also important in demonstrating the distinct neuronal mechanisms by which encoding and retrieval are achieved.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2425242025?rss=1">Specializations in Amygdalar and Hippocampal Innervation of the Primate Nucleus Accumbens Shell</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical to goal-directed behaviors as the main input structure for limbic pathways to the basal ganglia. The NAc shell is composed of inhibitory projection neurons that receive robust glutamatergic innervation from both the hippocampus and amygdala. In view of primate-specific changes in the neural composition of the NAc, it is still unclear how its circuits are organized in primates. We used a system-to-synapse approach to characterize amygdalar and hippocampal pathway distribution, innervation patterns, and synaptic characteristics in the NAc shell of rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) of both sexes. Key findings showed that both the amygdalar and hippocampal pathways disproportionately innervated NAc shell interneurons relative to their population sizes, assessed via confocal systems&rsquo; analysis and at the synaptic level with electron microscopy. The synaptic features associated with the two pathways were distinct. The amygdalar projection was denser, with larger boutons that more often contained mitochondria than the hippocampal projection. The hippocampal pathway had larger postsynaptic densities and more frequently formed perforated synapses, which are features associated with high synaptic efficacy. In addition, hippocampal boutons more frequently formed multiple synapses, often with one projection neuron and one interneuron. These interactions with the NAc shell suggest distinct mechanisms for the processing of affective signaling from the amygdala and contextual information from the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Imitation plays a key role in the acquisition of speech and cultural behaviors. Studies suggest that social interaction facilitates imitative learning, indicating that neural circuits involved in social behaviors can also influence the process of imitation. Vocal imitation in juvenile songbirds serves as a valuable model to investigate this idea. Here, we explore the mechanisms of tutor&ndash;pupil social interaction and selective song learning in male zebra finches, with a particular focus on the amygdala, which can regulate social behaviors via its processing of values and emotions in mammals. When sequentially exposed to two tutors, normal pupils selectively learned song from the tutor who sang longer but less frequently. When hearing songs, pupils preferentially approached the selected tutor. Excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala increased pupils&rsquo; social motivation toward tutors yet diminished their song-responsive approach, especially to the selected tutor. Whereas the pupils with amygdala lesions retained their ability to imitate song, the tutor selection became more unpredictable with diminished preference for a specific tutor. Neuronal tracing confirmed that the zebra finch amygdala is connected to the circuits involved in social functions but lacks direct connections to those critical for song control and learning. These results suggest that the amygdala regulates social motivation and tutor selection in juvenile zebra finches, highlighting its role in imitative learning.</p>

                <p>Models of experience-dependent neuroplasticity predict that the acquisition and extensive use of a new skill trigger a nonlinear trajectory of neurostructural modifications, where initial expansion of relevant brain areas subsequently (once the skill is acquired) gives way to volumetric renormalization. Such predictions also apply in the domain of language during learning and/or simultaneous management of two (or more) linguistic systems. In a sample of 69 young adult Russian&ndash;English bilinguals, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in bilingual engagement nonlinearly correlate with normalized volume of the hippocampus&mdash;a key learning-related brain region particularly amenable to experience-dependent plasticity. Results revealed an inverted U-shape association between second language engagement and left hippocampal gray matter volume. The present results replicate and expand the findings from aging populations, showing a nonlinear pattern of structural hippocampal plasticity in healthy young adults. These findings support the role of bilingualism as a promoter of experience-dependent neuroplasticity.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) integrate visceral and limbic inputs and project to multiple brain regions to bias behavior toward aversive or defensive states. This study examines MOR signaling in anterior PVT neurons in brain slices from untreated and morphine-treated animals. Imaging in a MOR-Cre reporter rat revealed extensive expression in aPVT cells, and the application of [Met]<sup>5&ndash;</sup> enkephalin (ME) induced outward currents which were abolished by the MOR-selective antagonist CTAP. A saturating concentration of ME resulted in desensitization that was blocked by compound 101, indicating a phosphorylation-dependent process. The opioid sensitivity of amygdala-, nucleus accumbens-, and prefrontal cortex-projecting neurons was then examined. Neurons that projected to the amygdala were more sensitive to ME than cortical- and accumbal-projecting cells. Following chronic treatment, tolerance to morphine was found in neurons projecting to the amygdala and nucleus accumbens with a trend toward tolerance observed in neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex. The results reveal that adaptations to chronic opioid exposure are in the aPVT circuits contribute to affective pain processing and may provide specific insights into the etiology of withdrawal following the cessation of opioid use.</p>

                Background Due to occupational exposure, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) infection than the general population. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may increase the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs, potentially reducing the available health workforce. We examined the association between NCDs and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among infected HCWs. Methods This cohort study used data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) database. HCWs hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2023 due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Variables collected included demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization outcomes. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean/standard deviation (SD), median/interquartile range (IQR), or frequencies and proportions. For each NCD, the relative risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, was calculated using log-binomial regression as well as the population-attributable fraction. Results There were 17,502 HCWs, 95.7% of whom had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority were female (66.5%) and the mean age (SD) was 49.8 (14.3) years. Roughly, half (51.42%) of HCWs had no comorbidities, 29.28% had one comorbidity, 14.68% had 2 comorbidities and <5% had ≥3 comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (49.40%) and cardiovascular disease (36.90%). Approximately one-fifth of the HCWs had severe COVID-19 (16.95%) and 10.68% of the HCWs with COVID-19 died. Being ≥45 years old, male gender, smoking, obesity, and certain NCDs increased the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Obesity and diabetes mellitus were the leading risk factors in terms of the population-attributable risk for COVID-19 severity (6.89%) and mortality (36.00%) respectively. Conclusions Many HCWs with COVID-19 had one or more NCDs. Obesity and diabetes mellitus increased COVID-19 severity and mortality risk. Reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus would yield the biggest reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs.

                Hepatic tuberculosis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It can clinically and radiologically mimic primary hepatic malignancies, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease. Herein, we report the case of an 81-year-old man with a history of compensated advanced chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis B virus infection, treated with Entecavir, who presented with rapid clinical decline, weight loss, and a newly discovered hepatic mass. Imaging revealed a heterogeneous, necrotic lesion in segment IV, classified LR-M on LI-RADS, highly suggestive of malignancy. However, histopathology from a liver biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation with caseating necrosis, confirming the diagnosis of hepatic tuberculosis. No evidence of extrahepatic tuberculosis $ was found. The patient received a full 9-month course of anti-tuberculous therapy with complete clinical and radiological resolution. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of hepatic tuberculosis in cirrhotic patients, especially when mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Liver biopsy remains essential in atypical instances to avoid unnecessary interventions.

                Background Behaviors regarding child-bearing are among the most consequential ones within families, as child-rearing necessitates the active involvement of both partners. This dynamic suggests that individuals may seek partners with similar fertility preferences, leading to assortative mating based on these shared preferences. Data and Methods This study investigates second-child fertility outcomes using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and applies the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Furthermore, it examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences, utilizing the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The results, based on a sample of 2,351 household-level observations, indicate that spouses’ preferences are complementary. When a husband (or wife) desires a second child, their own preference has a stronger impact on the actual outcome to have of having a second child if their partner also expresses the same desire. Additionally, the findings reveal evidence of assortative mating in terms of preferences for the desired number of children. Moreover, in provinces with higher male-to-female sex ratios—indicating stronger bargaining power for women—a wife’s preference is more strongly aligned with her husband’s preference. For men, however, a husband’s preference aligns with his wife’s preference regardless of the sex ratio, suggesting that men’s bargaining power in the marriage market is relatively weak. Conclusions The findings have two key implications. First, shared fertility preferences between spouses show a complementary effect, increasing the likelihood of having a second child. Second, marriage matching is not random, as individuals are more likely to partner with those who share similar fertility preferences. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power are positively associated with their husbands’ desired family size.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network topology can contribute to explaining fundamental properties of genes, from expression levels to evolutionary constraints. Genes central to a network are more likely to be both conserved and highly expressed, whereas genes that are able to evolve in response to selective pressures but expressed at lower levels are located on the periphery of the network. The stress response is likewise thought to be conserved and its associated genes highly expressed, however, experimental evidence for these patterns is limited. Therefore, we examined here whether the transcriptomic response to two environmental stressors (heat, UV, and their combination) is related to PPI architecture in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio)</i> embryos. We show that stress response genes are situated more centrally in the PPI network. The transcriptomic response to heat was located in both central and peripheral positions, whereas UV response transcripts occupied central to intermediate positions. Network position was further linked to the magnitude of fold changes of genes and types and number of their associated phenotype GO terms. Across treatments, differentially expressed genes in different parts of the network affected identical phenotypes. Our results indicate that the zebrafish stress response is considered conserved but also have stressor-specific aspects. These properties can aid in better understanding the organismal response to diverse and co-occurring stressors. Given the speed of contemporary changes in aquatic ecosystems, our approach can aid in identifying novel key regulators of the systemic response to specific stressors.

                <p>by Rich Pang</p>

Irregularly timed action potentials, or spikes, are pervasively observed in the brain activity of awake mammals. However, the role of this temporal irregularity in neural computation is still not well understood. In canonical network models irregular spiking emerges via balanced, fluctuating input currents, leading to collective responses that track inputs linearly. How networks characterized by irregular spiking could support flexible nonlinear dynamics needed for general-purpose computation remains under ongoing debate. Here we characterize the dynamics of networks whose elementary unit is not a single neuron but a small group of neurons, with distinct tunings, that compete at each timestep via a winner-take-all (WTA) interaction. While WTA has long been proposed as an elementary functional motif in the brain and represents a powerful computational primitive, how large networks of such units behave has received less investigation. We show that these networks, like classic excitatory-inhibitory balanced networks, exhibit a chaotic fluctuation-driven regime characterized by sustained irregular activity resembling realistic cortical spiking, which we interpret as a multidimensional balance spread over several competing neural populations with different tunings. We develop a mean-field theory for the network, which shows how irregular spiking sustained by time-varying input fluctuations can support flexible nonlinear collective dynamics. Using the theory we predict and verify network regimes in which input fluctuations alone yield multistability, stable sequence generation, or complex heterogeneous firing rate dynamics—three core dynamical primitives thought to underlie memory-dependent neural computation—via consistent Poisson-like spiking produced through chaos. Thus, networks of WTA units support a chaotic fluctuation-driven regime characterized by irregular spiking that can power complex nonlinear collective dynamics. This represents a new model of brain activity capable of simultaneously reproducing realistic spike trains and diverse nonlinear firing rate patterns well posed for flexible computation, and which can be trained or fit to data.

                <p>by Jingming Xue, Robert C. Wilson, Mary A. Peterson</p>

Research shows that semantics, activated by words, impacts object detection. Skocypec & Peterson (2022) indexed object detection via correct reports of where figures lie in bipartite displays depicting familiar objects on one side of a border. They reported 2 studies with intermixed Valid and Invalid labels shown before test displays and a third, control, study. Valid labels denoted display objects. Invalid labels denoted unrelated objects in a different or the same superordinate-level category in studies 1 & 2, respectively. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to elucidate the mechanisms of their results. DDM revealed that, following Valid labels, drift rate toward the correct decision increased, i.e., SNR increased. Invalid labels do not affect drift rate directly, but they create a context that diminishes the facilitative effect of valid labels on evidence accumulation. Threshold was higher in study 2 than control, but not in study 1. That more evidence must be accumulated from displays that follow labels denoting objects in the same-superordinate category as the object in the display indicates that more evidence from the display is needed to resolve semantic uncertainty regarding which object is present. These results support the view that semantic networks are engaged in object detection.

A new study in PLOS Biology shows that Liprin-α and RIM form condensates which not only scaffold presynaptic protein architectures but also fine-tune vesicle priming and release dynamics.

Liprin-α and RIM form liquid phase-separated condensates that organize presynaptic architecture and fine-tune neurotransmitter release. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology analysing how these dynamic assemblies shape synaptic fidelity and what their disruption might mean in neurodevelopmental disease.

                <p>by Anders Hougaard, Cenk Ayata, K.C. Brennan, Arn M.J.M. van den Maagdenberg, Messoud Ashina</p>

Migraine aura – manifesting as transient, neurological disturbances – presents a complex and unresolved relationship with migraine headache. Cortical spreading depolarization (SD), recognized as the mechanism underlying aura symptoms, has been shown to trigger head pain through activation of trigeminal nociceptors in animal models. However, recent clinical data challenge the notion that aura causes migraine headache in patients. In this Essay, we critically examine the pathophysiology of migraine aura and migraine headache, exploring evidence from clinical observations, (genetic) mouse models, and pharmacological studies. We also discuss the role of SD, the trigeminovascular system, and the impact of pharmacological agents that both trigger and treat migraine attacks. Our essay highlights the complexities and conflicting data surrounding the interplay between aura and headache, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel this mystery and improve therapeutic strategies for individuals with migraine.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27281?af=R">Effect of Cumulative Exposure to Ocrelizumab on Memory B‐Cell Repopulation Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Extended interval dosing protocols of B-cell-depleting therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS) are being developed, but intervals between infusions are often arbitrary. We describe total and memory B-cell repopulation dynamics in MS patients on a memory B-cell-guided extended interval dosing ocrelizumab (OCR) protocol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>OCR was administered on peripheral CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell repopulation (≥1 cell/μL), monitored using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Associations with CD19+ B cells and CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells were tested using mixed-effect hurdle models, with rate ratios (RR) predicting cell counts and odds ratios (OR) predicting cell depletion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected 1,369 samples from 101 patients, 61.4% women, aged 42.2 years (IQR 32.3–51.1 years) and follow up 4.1 years (IQR 2.9–5.2 years). The median time between samples and previous OCR infusion was 6.6 months (IQR 4.7–8.8 months). Time since previous OCR infusion was positively associated with CD19+ B cells (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.10–1.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell counts (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.09–1.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A greater cumulative OCR dose was associated with persistent CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell depletion (OR 1.90, 1.57–2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). CD19+ B-cell repopulation was inversely associated with age (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Female patients showed a lower ratio of CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells/total CD19+ B cells (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26–0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Disease activity was low, with most radiological activity observed within the first year of OCR treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory B-cell repopulation becomes slower with increasing cumulative OCR dose. Age- and sex-related mechanisms probably influence repopulation dynamics. Given the evidence for a pathogenic role of memory B cells, these observations could be considered when planning extended interval dosing strategies of OCR treatment.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research on people with KOA has addressed kinetic chain and core muscle contribution in disease progression. Objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of including the CARE -KOA© regimen and evaluate its effect on pain, patient-reported functional outcomes, physical function tests, knee strength, and core endurance. Methods/Design 15 patients above 45 were recruited and underwent a 4-week CARE -KOA© program with 12 supervised sessions over four weeks. Pre- and Post-exercise assessment included evaluating the primary outcome pain using the VAS scale and the patient-reported outcome using the KOOS scale. The secondary outcomes, knee muscle strength, core endurance, and the physical function tests, i.e., the stair climb test, the sit-to-stand test, the 40m fast-paced walking test, and the timed up-and-go test, were also evaluated. The data collected in the study was analyzed using the statistical software JAMOVI. p < 0.05 was significant. Results Notably, all the parameters examined exhibited a statistically significant difference between their pre-intervention and post-intervention values, except the knee muscle strength in the flexors of the affected knee and extensors of the unaffected knee. Conclusion Patients who completed a 4-week supervised CARE -KOA© program alongside routine rehabilitation experienced reduced pain and improved outcomes. This approach aims to address biomechanical issues and positively impacts pain mechanisms.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction, leads to chronic intermittent hypoxia (cIH) and induces cognitive and neuronal network disruptions similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These pathologies are often presented together in the elderly and share some pathophysiological mechanisms. The presence of amyloid beta (Aβ), observed both in AD and OSA patients, can alter brain function, cholinergic modulation and memory either independently or in addition with cIH. To explore these possibilities, we studied the pathological effects of Aβ, cIH, and their combination on cognition and hippocampal activity, and its modulations by the cholinomimetics carbachol, muscarine, and nicotine, along with evaluations of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in the septum and the hippocampus. We found that cIH and Aβ similarly affect spatial memory and additively impact aversive memory (sparing recognition memory). Although cIH and Aβ share some pathological effects on hippocampal activity and its modulation by cholinomimetics, when combined, they produce an additive inhibition at the population and single-cell levels more evident in the presence of nicotine. No change in ChAT expression was observed. Remarkably, the departure from normal firing as well as the disruption of carbachol-induced response correlates with the reduction of aversive memory in our experimental groups. In summary, cIH and Aβ share pathological effects, but their combination exacerbates functional pathology, contributing to our understanding of AD/OSA pathophysiology and co-morbidity.</p>

                Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a hallmark of many neurological diseases. It is known that proinflammatory cytokines can disrupt tight junctions between endothelial cells of the BBB, allowing larger molecules to penetrate the brain. Along with BBB disruption, these diseases also feature increased numbers of CD8 T cells as components of the immune cell population in the brain. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of CD8 T cell-mediated BBB disruption, including the roles of antigen presentation through MHC class I molecules, which emerge as an important determining feature of BBB disruption and immune cell infiltration into the brain.

                Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates not only the well-known β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides but also APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). Recent evidence from studies in murine- or human-derived (neuronal) models suggests that APP-CTFs may independently contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology by disrupting cellular homeostasis. This review highlights pathological effects unique to APP-CTFs that are independent of Aβ, shedding light on their distinct role in disease progression. We explore the mechanisms underlying APP-CTF-induced toxicity, with a focus on their contribution to endolysosomal dysfunction. APP-CTFs impair lysosomal function and disrupt calcium signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, compounding organelle dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms will aid the design of preventive therapeutic strategies that take into account the impact of APP-CTFs on AD pathology.

                Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of pregnancy, posing significant health risks for both women and their children. Unlike other subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD), PPD is thought to be biologically relatively homogenous, as it is precipitated by a specific biological trigger – the profound hormonal shifts associated with pregnancy and delivery. However, the underlying pathophysiology of PPD is still unclear, with a variety of biological factors likely at play. In this review, we examine recent biological findings related to neuroimaging, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroactive steroids (NAS), epigenetics, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) and explore processes that may be unique to PPD versus those shared with MDD, along with avenues of future research aimed at PPD prevention and treatment.

                Roy et al. identify VDAC1 as a target for pharmacologically induced insulin hypersecretion in β cells. Hypersecretory stress causes a distinct transcriptomic signature that implicates ER-associated degradation (ERAD) as an adaptive response. The relative abundance of ERAD components is altered in pancreatic islets of type 2 diabetic humans.

                Nguyen et al. demonstrate that variation in inverted repeats within C. difficile’s flagellar switch impacts the phase-variable expression of flagellar genes, which contributes to the variable disease outcomes observed within a single RT027 strain type.
