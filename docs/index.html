              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25998">Integrated Information Theory: A Consciousness-First Approach to What Exists</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's "consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976">Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18347">Modeling Neural Activity with Conditionally Linear Dynamical Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural population activity exhibits complex, nonlinear dynamics, varying in time, over trials, and across experimental conditions. Here, we develop Conditionally Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) models as a general-purpose method to characterize these dynamics. These models use Gaussian Process (GP) priors to capture the nonlinear dependence of circuit dynamics on task and behavioral variables. Conditioned on these covariates, the data is modeled with linear dynamics. This allows for transparent interpretation and tractable Bayesian inference. We find that CLDS models can perform well even in severely data-limited regimes (e.g. one trial per condition) due to their Bayesian formulation and ability to share statistical power across nearby task conditions. In example applications, we apply CLDS to model thalamic neurons that nonlinearly encode heading direction and to model motor cortical neurons during a cued reaching task.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06253">Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balanced neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25119">Effect of an auditory static distractor on the perception of an auditory moving target</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that listeners lose the ability to discriminate the direction of motion of a revolving sound (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) beyond a critical velocity ("the upper limit"), primarily due to degraded front-back discrimination. Little is known about how this ability is affected by simultaneously present distractor sounds, despite the real-life importance of tracking moving sounds in the presence of distractors. We hypothesized that the presence of a static distractor sound would impair the perception of moving target sounds and reduce the upper limit, and show that this is indeed the case. A distractor on the right was as effective as a distractor at the front in reducing the upper limit despite the importance of resolving front-back confusions. By manipulating the spectral content of both the target and distractor, we found that the upper limit was reduced if and only if the distractor spectrally overlaps with the target in the frequency range relevant for front/back discrimination; energetic masking thus explains the upper limit reduction by the distractor. We did not find any evidence for informational masking by the distractor. Our findings form the first steps towards a better understanding of the tracking of multiple sounds in the presence of distractors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943">InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25787">Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26383">Advancing Forest Fires Classification using Neurochaos Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.26383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68 for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492">Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.26492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed (PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework. We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes (or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers. This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific, engineering or technical problems in real time.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs, establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices, including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions, Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.

                arXiv:2510.25933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI 69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's $d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp). When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model (Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance ($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100; non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within $\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains (Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

                arXiv:2510.25993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC) framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation. However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling efficient online learning at the edge.

                arXiv:2510.26285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures.

                arXiv:2510.26718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption. This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately 10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

                arXiv:2501.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are distinguished from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their complex neuronal dynamics and sparse binary activations (spikes) inspired by the biological neural system. Traditional neuron models use iterative step-by-step dynamics, resulting in serial computation and slow training speed of SNNs. Recently, parallelizable spiking neuron models have been proposed to fully utilize the massive parallel computing ability of graphics processing units to accelerate the training of SNNs. However, existing parallelizable spiking neuron models involve dense floating operations and can only achieve high long-term dependencies learning ability with a large order at the cost of huge computational and memory costs. To solve the dilemma of performance and costs, we propose the mul-free channel-wise Parallel Spiking Neuron, which is hardware-friendly and suitable for SNNs' resource-restricted application scenarios. The proposed neuron imports the channel-wise convolution to enhance the learning ability, induces the sawtooth dilations to reduce the neuron order, and employs the bit-shift operation to avoid multiplications. The algorithm for the design and implementation of acceleration methods is discussed extensively. Our methods are validated in neuromorphic Spiking Heidelberg Digits voices, sequential CIFAR images, and neuromorphic DVS-Lip vision datasets, achieving superior performance over SOTA spiking neurons. Training speed results demonstrate the effectiveness of our acceleration methods, providing a practical reference for future research. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/PengXue0812/Multiplication-Free-Parallelizable-Spiking-Neurons-with-Efficient-Spatio-Temporal-Dynamics}{Github}.

Comparisons against a baseline (Vanilla IBP IoU) highlight the superior performance of IBP IoU in ensuring accuracy and stability, contributing to more secure and robust machine learning applications.

Abstract: Chaos-based reinforcement learning (CBRL) is a method in which the agent's internal chaotic dynamics drives exploration. However, the learning algorithms in CBRL have not been thoroughly developed in previous studies, nor have they incorporated recent advances in reinforcement learning. This study introduced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which is one of the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can treat deterministic and continuous action spaces, to CBRL. The validation results provide several insights. First, TD3 works as a learning algorithm for CBRL in a simple goal-reaching task. Second, CBRL agents with TD3 can autonomously suppress their exploratory behavior as learning progresses and resume exploration when the environment changes. Finally, examining the effect of the agent's chaoticity on learning shows that there exists a suitable range of chaos strength in the agent's model to flexibly switch between exploration and exploitation and adapt to environmental changes.

                arXiv:2411.10573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.

                The brain's connectome provides a powerful blueprint for designing efficient neural networks, yet the impact of incorporating its intricate, non-random architecture into machine learning models remains underexplored. Here, we integrate empirical structural connectomes from four model species: fruit fly, mouse, rat, and macaque, as the recurrent layer in echo state networks (ESNs). We demonstrate that biologically realized networks, particularly the macaque connectome, achieve superior performance in chaotic time series prediction and exhibit higher memory capacity compared to randomly shuffled controls. This computational advantage correlates with small-world topology, which scales with phylogenetic level. Crucially, we identify that weakly connected but highly central nodes are essential for optimal network dynamics; their targeted perturbation significantly degrades performance. Furthermore, functional connectomes from Alzheimer's disease patients show computational deficits resembling those induced by weak-tie disruption in healthy networks. Our findings establish that evolved connectome topology is fundamental to efficient information processing, providing key principles for bio-inspired artificial intelligence

">Language comprehension functionally modulates first-order relay thalamic nuclei</a></h4>

              
                Language, a uniquely human higher-order cognitive function, has traditionally been attributed to cortical mechanisms with limited attention given to subcortical contributions. Recent advances in non-invasive neuroimaging have revealed that thalamic activity can be modulated by attention and task demands. Moreover, lesion studies have hinted at the thalamus's potential role in language processing. Nevertheless, the precise involvement of this structure in language remains unclear. Here, we argue that language-related modulations can occur as early as the sensory thalamic stage, challenging the conventional view of language preprocessing as a predominantly language function. Using functional MRI to image 40 human participants (both female and male) while processing linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli of three main language systems (reading, speech comprehension, and speech production), we demonstrate specific activation of first-order nuclei during targeted language system tasks: lateral geniculate (LGN) for reading, medial geniculate (MGN) for speech comprehension and ventrolateral (VLN) for speech production. Notably, we show linguistic versus non-linguistic stimuli exhibit functional modulations during comprehension tasks (reading and speech) of left MGN and, to a lesser extent, left LGN?in line with prior studies of lateralization of language processes. Multi-voxel classification analysis confirmed left-lateralized linguistic modulation in the MGN, but not in the LGN.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013646">The relationship between anxious traits and learning about changes in stochasticity and volatility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brónagh McCoy, Rebecca P. Lawson</p>

Anxiety is known to alter learning in uncertain environments. Experimental paradigms and computational models addressing these differences have mainly assessed the impact of volatility, with more highly anxious individuals showing a reduced adaptation of learning rate in volatile compared to stable environments. Previous research has not, however, independently assessed the impact of both changes in volatility, i.e., reversals in reward contingency, and changes in stochasticity (noise) in the same individuals. Here, in an original online study (Experiment 1; N = 80) and a pre-registered replication attempt (Experiment 2; N = 160), we use a simple probabilistic reversal learning paradigm to independently manipulate the level of volatility and noise at the experimental level in a fully orthogonal design. We replicate previous studies showing general increases, irrespective of anxiety levels, in positive learning rate (Experiment 1) and negative learning rate (Experiments 1 and 2) for high compared to low volatility, but here only in the context of low noise. Across both experiments, there was an interaction between volatility and noise on behaviour, with more win-stay responses for high compared to low volatility under low noise, but similar or fewer win-stay responses for the same comparison under high noise. The impact of anxious traits presented differently across experiments; in Experiment 1, increases in lose-shift responses in high versus low noise conditions scaled with level of anxious traits, whereas in Experiment 2, there was a full interaction between volatility, noise and anxious traits on win-stay behaviour. These anxiety-related lose-shift or win-stay differences were reflected in their corresponding negative and positive reinforcement learning rate parameters, respectively. Experiment 2 represents a more robust set of results with a larger sample size, balanced gender representation, and extended block order balancing. These findings suggest that changes in both sources of uncertainty - stochasticity and volatility - should be carefully considered when investigating learning and how learning is shaped by anxiety.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly central to biomedical research, the need for trustworthy models is more pressing than ever. In this paper, we present nine concise and actionable tips to help researchers build ML systems that are technically sound but ethically responsible, and contextually appropriate for biomedical applications. These tips address the multifaceted nature of trustworthiness, emphasizing the importance of considering all potential consequences, recognizing the limitations of current methods, taking into account the needs of all involved stakeholders, and following open science practices. We discuss technical, ethical, and domain-specific challenges, offering guidance on how to define trustworthiness and how to mitigate sources of untrustworthiness. By embedding trustworthiness into every stage of the ML pipeline – from research design to deployment – these recommendations aim to support both novice and experienced practitioners in creating ML systems that can be relied upon in biomedical science.

                <p>by Leyao Wang, Mengyuan Zhao, Hao Xie, Yuqing Qian, Wenhuan Lu, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can significantly affect RNA expression, gene regulation, and determination of cell fate. As a common and abundant post-transcriptional modification (PTM) of RNA, m6A is also closely associated with the occurrence of numerous diseases. Thus, identifying the m6A modification site in the RNA sequence is a prerequisite for related research. High-throughput sequencing technology has high requirements and low cost performance. Computational methods have made encouraging progress in site prediction. However, most models only consider the effects of different species, ignoring the simultaneous exploration of RNA modifications in different tissues within the same species. We develop and validate a fuzzy system based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL), named BSBL-TSK-FS, which is a powerful sequence-level m6A prediction model. We introduce a Bayesian method that provides a posterior probability output to produce more sparse solutions so that the model has higher accuracy. The model classifies the m6A sites in several tissues of mouse, human, and rat. Under the five-fold cross-validation method (5-CV), the precision of the BSBL-TSK-FS model is 0.84 0.95. The accuracy of our model improves by 9.4% over the existing SOTA predictors. BSBL-TSK-FS achieves superior performance over current SOTA methods. Finally, in order to verify the generalizability of the model, we carry out cross-species tests, and the results prove the robustness and adaptability of the model. An accurate and reliable sequence modification prediction model is developed to better understand the complex landscape of methylation modification.

                <p>by Adina Matache, Joao Rodrigues Lima-Junior, Maxim Kuznetsov, Konstancja Urbaniak, Sergio Branciamore, Andrei S. Rodin, Peter P. Lee, Russell C. Rockne</p>

Prior studies have shown that approximately 40% of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) patients harbor immune signaling defects in their blood at diagnosis, and the presence of these defects predicts overall survival. Therefore, it is of interest to quantitatively characterize and measure signaling errors in immune signaling systems in these patients. Here we propose a novel approach combining communication theory and signal processing concepts to model ligand discrimination in immune cells in the peripheral blood. We use the model to measure the specificity of ligand discrimination in the presence of molecular noise by estimating the probability of error, which is the probability of making a wrong ligand identification. We apply our model to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway using high dimensional spectral flow cytometry measurements of transcription factors, including phosphorylated STATs and SMADs, in immune cells stimulated with several cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) from 19 ER+ breast cancer patients and 32 healthy controls. In addition, we apply our model to 10 healthy donor samples treated with a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor. Our results show reduced ligand identification accuracy and higher levels of molecular noise in BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which may indicate altered immune signaling and the potential for immune cell dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, the inhibition of JAK1/2 produces a unique pattern of signaling dysfunction, inducing increased ligand detection error rates and reduced signal-to-noise ratios for most immune cell subtypes. These results suggest a means to improve the use of signaling kinase inhibitor therapies by identifying patients with favorable ligand discrimination specificity profiles in their immune cells.

                <p>by Aapo E. Korhonen, Olli Sarala, Tuomas Hautamäki, Markku Kuismin, Mikko J. Sillanpää</p>

Gaussian graphical models (GGM) are powerful tools to examine partial correlation structures in high-dimensional omics datasets. Partial correlation networks can explain complex relationships between genes or other biological variables. Bayesian implementations of GGMs have recently received more attention. Usually, the most demanding parts of GGM implementations are: (i) hyperparameter tuning, (ii) edge selection, (iii) scalability for large datasets, and (iv) the prior choice for Bayesian GGM.
To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Bayesian GGM using a hierarchical matrix-F prior with a fast implementation. We show, with extensive simulations and biological example analyses, that this prior has competitive network recovery capabilities compared to state-of-the-art approaches and good properties for recovering meaningful networks. We present a new way of tuning the shrinkage hyperparameter by constraining the condition number of the estimated precision matrix. For edge selection, we propose using approximated credible intervals (CI) whose width is controlled by the false discovery rate. An optimal CI is selected by maximizing an estimated F<sub>1</sub>-score via permutations. In addition, a specific choice of hyperparameter can make the proposed prior better suited for clustering and community detection. Our method, with a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, computationally outperforms existing Bayesian GGM approaches that use Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.
The method is implemented in the R package HMFGraph, found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph. All codes to reproduce the results are found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph-Supplementary.

Inconsistent characterization and reporting of laboratory animal genetics undermine research quality and reproducibility. We need to recognize the value of genetic characterization, improve training for researchers, and implement rigorous reporting standards.

Incomplete characterization and inconsistent reporting of laboratory animal genetics undermine study quality and limit research reproducibility.

Scientific progress relies on science’s capacity for self-correction. If erroneous articles remain unchallenged in the publication record, they can mislead future research and undermine evidence-based decision-making. All articles included in a systematic review of animal studies on early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed for image-related issues. We included 608 articles, of which 243 articles were identified as problematic (40.0%). Of the 243 problematic articles, 55 (22.6%) have been corrected, 7 (2.9%) have received an expression of concern, 5 (2.1%) were marked with the Taylor & Francis under investigation pop-up, and 19 (7.8%) were retracted. In 9 of the 55 corrected articles (16.4%), new problems were found after correction or not all issues were resolved in the correction. Most (<i>n</i> = 213, 87.7%) problematic articles had a corresponding author affiliated to an institute from China. Our results show that the self-correcting mechanisms in science have stalled in this field of research. Our findings provide insight in the prevalence of image-related issues and can help publishers to take appropriate action. We can only uphold science’s capacity for self-correction when problematic articles are actively identified by peers, and when publishers take swift and adequate action to repair the scientific record.

Assessing species geographic distributions is critical to approximate their ecological niches, understand how global change may reshape their occurrence patterns, and predict their extinction risks. Yet, species records are over-aggregated across taxonomic, geographic, environmental, and anthropogenic dimensions. The under-sampling of remote locations biases the quantification of species geographic distributions and ecological niche for most species. Here, we used nearly one thousand environmental DNA (eDNA) samples across the world’s oceans, including polar regions and tropical remote islands, to determine the extent to which the geographic and ecological niche ranges of marine fishes are underestimated through the lens of global occurrence records based on conventional surveys. Our eDNA surveys revealed that the known geographic ranges for 93% of species and the ecological niche ranges for 7% of species were underestimated, and contributed to filling them. We show that the probability to detect a range filling for a given species is primarily shaped by the GBIF/OBIS sampling effort in a cell, but also by the number of occurrences available for the species. Most gap fillings were achieved by addressing a methodological sampling bias, notably when eDNA facilitated the detection of small fishes in previously sampled locations using conventional methods. Using a machine learning model, we found that a local effort of 10 eDNA samples would detect 24 additional fish species on average and a maximum of 98 species in previously unsampled tropical areas. Yet, a null model revealed that only half of ecological niche range fillings would be due to eDNA surveys, beyond a random allocation of classical sampling effort. Altogether, our results suggest that sampling in remote areas and performing eDNA surveys in over-sampled areas may both increase fish ecological niche ranges toward unexpected values with consequences in biodiversity modeling, management, and conservation.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This essay describes the development of the in vitro hippocampal slice technique and my small contributions to it and to influencing Roger Nicoll's early interests in the hippocampus and LTP. My Ph.D. work at Harvard with Timothy Teyler was on field potential studies of synaptic plasticity, including LTP, in the rat in vitro hippocampal slice. As a postdoc, I introduced the slice preparation to Roger Nicoll's lab at UCSF but failed to interest him in LTP. Here I explain how Nicoll's scientific philosophy both motivated me to develop our first submersion slice chamber and kept him from investigating LTP for nearly a decade. Finally, I recount the history of the name “LTP.”</p>

     alt="Timing of Delamination of Inner Ear Neurons Specifies Their Topography and Target Innervation"/>
<p>Developmental time can encode positional information.
Timing of delamination of otic neuroblasts specifies their final positions within the auditory-vestibular ganglion.
Target innervation choice of the sensory epithelium and organisation of fibres in the 8th nerve are also augured by the time when a neuroblast leaves the otic epithelium.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurons of the inner ear delaminate from a sensorineurogenic epithelium in the ventral part of the otocyst. Delaminated neuroblasts then condense to form the acoustico-vestibular ganglion (AVG). As they differentiate, the neurons connect mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear with their targets in the hindbrain in a precise topographical manner. However, it is unclear how or when positional identities of neurons are specified within the AVG, such that topographical information from HCs is maintained into the auditory centers of the brain. Here, we find that the time of delamination from the otocyst correlates with neuroblast position in the ganglion. Using markers for neuronal differentiation, we find that the ganglion differentiates from a dorsal to ventral wave. Neurons that differentiate first innervate the vestibular apparatus, including the lagena and the proximal regions of the BP. Using sequential somatic cell labeling, we find that the central projection also follows a similar dependency on delamination order. Our studies show that the time of delamination of otic neuroblasts presages their target innervation choice and fiber positions within the developing eighth cranial nerve. We suggest that temporal information specifies the spatial identities during early inner ear neuron development.</p>

     alt="Brain-Wide Patterns of CRF Receptor 1 Expression in the Transgenic CRFR1-Cre-2a-tdTom Rat"/>
<p>In this article, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre-2A-tdTomato rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns. We further demonstrate that Cre recombinase expression in CRFR1 neurons can be used to express virally delivered transgenes, which can be used to trace CRF-responsive neuronal circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to manipulate neurons that express corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or its receptors has led to many new discoveries about how CRF signaling modulates stress-related behaviors in mice. However, similar advances in rats have been limited by the lack of reporter lines targeting CRF receptors, restricting access to behavioral paradigms that are more suitable for, or specific to, rats. Here, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns, as determined by in situ hybridization in rats and by genetic labeling in CRFR1 transgenic mice. We detail expression patterns at multiple rostrocaudal levels to validate the use of this transgenic rat in multiple neural circuits that signal via CRF activation of CRFR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of Cre recombinase, combined with viral vector delivery, can be used to trace CRFR1-expressing neurons and their axonal terminals in target regions. This study is intended to serve as a resource for examining the expression pattern of CRFR1 and as a validation of the CRFR1-Cre rat for reliable use with Cre-dependent viral approaches to manipulate and/or record the activity of CRFR1-expressing neurons in distinct brain regions. We expect that the availability of the CRFR1-Cre rat, along with an increasing number of transgenic rat lines, will further expand our understanding of how CRF transmission mediates stress responses by leveraging the behavioral strengths of the rat as a model system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1185/v1?src=rss">DTAShiny: An Interactive R Shiny Application for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Analysis and Visualization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) analyses are essential in clinical research and medical decision-making. Despite the availability of R packages such as pROC and ROCR, their use often requires programming expertise, limiting accessibility for many clinical researchers. An interactive, code-free method is therefore needed to enhance usability and understanding. We developed DTAShiny, an R Shiny based web application that allows users to upload diagnostic data sets in CSV or Stata formats, perform DTA metric calculations, and generate dynamic visualizations. The application is built using shiny, bs4Dash, pROC, ggplot2, and other packages. It includes heuristic-based automatic detection of reference and test variables and offers real time threshold adjustment via an interactive slider. DTAShiny computes standard sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC and advanced F1 score, balanced accuracy. These DTA metrics are accompanied with approximate confidence intervals. The tool generates ROC and PR curves, distribution plots, and a calibration style plot. Real-time interactivity enables users to observe trade offs as thresholds change. This Zenodo deposit contains the DATAShiny source code, an example anonymised dataset, and documentation to run the app locally.

                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakhs population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there are deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system still exists due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health engineering department.

                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that has been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the salivary levels human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), and to assess their diagnostic potential using ROC curve analysis in periodontitis patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Our findings showed that salivary HLA-DR4 levels were significantly lower in patient groups compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000), whereas salivary MMP-8 and ACPA levels were significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.034) and (P = 0.001) respectively, with no significant differences between the patient groups(P > 0.05). On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls (P = 0.001), with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                Background The translation of research evidence into routine healthcare practice is often slow and inconsistent, even timely implementation can significantly improve patient outcomes. While implementation science offers strategies to close this gap, current approaches are frequently manual, fragmented, and poorly integrated within healthcare systems. To address these challenges, we propose ImpleMATE – an AI-powered implementation science platform designed to streamline implementation efforts. Grounded in the Learning Health System (LHS) model, ImpleMATE aims to establish a continuous, data-driven cycle of learning and improvement in implementation practice. Methods ImpleMATE will be developed through a co-design and co-production approach rooted in human-centred design principles. Development will proceed through four key activities: (1) establishing a data processing pipeline and building an implementation-focused ontology; (2) creating and validating an AI system to extract implementation knowledge, structure the ontology, and support implementation solution delivery; (3) designing an interactive web application to deliver AI-powered decision support and streamline implementation processes; and (4) developing an evaluation framework to assess platform’s effectiveness and plan for national integration. These activities align with three core components of the LHS model: converting data into knowledge, translating knowledge into practice, and feeding implementation process and outcome data back into the system for continuous learning. The platform will be underpinned by strong ethical and governance frameworks to ensure data privacy, transparency, and responsible AI use. Discussion ImpleMATE aims to transform the adoption of evidence-based innovations in healthcare by embedding trustworthy AI into the core of implementation practice. Through the integration of structured ontologies, real-time AI reasoning, and an interactive user interface, the platform will provide tailored solutions to support implementation efforts. Designed as a dynamic learning system, ImpleMATE will evolve with user input and real-world data, offering a scalable, ethically grounded solution to accelerate and enhance implementation across healthcare settings.

<p>Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal brain calcium-phosphate (Ca-Pi) deposits along microvessels or inside neuronal cells. Eight genes have been linked to PFBC, with the <i>SLC20A2</i> being the earliest identified. <i>SLC20A2</i> encodes PiT-2, which is crucial for Pi homeostasis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In <i>Slc20a2</i> homozygous knockout (HO) mice, the neurotoxic effects resulting from pathological CSF-Pi accumulation and the unique brain transcriptome suggested that the absence of PiT-2 might lead to myelin abnormalities. However, the myelin morphology and content under <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency remained largely unknown, and these were quantitatively investigated in this study. The results indicated no direct demyelination in the brains of <i>Slc20a2</i>-HO mice, but an increased susceptibility to demyelination under the induction of oligodendrocyte-toxic cuprizone (CPZ). The enhanced susceptibility was related to a greater infiltration of Th17 cells in the brain parenchyma, accompanying an exacerbation of brain calcification in <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency.</p>

<p>Newborns who later died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) appeared to show greater variability in auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at birth; however, these differences may reflect data quality rather than true physiological abnormalities, and expert-rated analyses did not replicate the finding. Further research is needed to clarify any link between ABR patterns and SIDS risk.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt; 1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesized that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. We integrated two secondary datasets and examined ABRs of newborns who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = 11) compared to a normative sample (<i>n</i> = 198,990), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. As hypothesized, infants who died from SIDS were more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Children who died of SIDS appeared to have shorter latencies to the trough that follows peak V in the left ear than children without SIDS. However, our expert-rated data failed to replicate this finding, suggesting it is unlikely to reflect a true effect. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

     alt="Evolution of Axonal Injury in the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration in Adult Ferrets"/>
<p>A clinically relevant ferret model of concussion was established using the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration. This model reproduced key features of diffuse axonal injury, including disrupted axonal transport, neurofilament pathology, and persistent disruption of the nodes of Ranvier, alongside motor and cognitive deficits.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Concussion-related symptoms, such as impaired balance, slower processing speed, attention deficits, memory dysfunction, and irritability, are thought to result from diffuse axonal injury (DAI), characterized by selective damage to white matter axons. Axons subjected to this mechanical stretch injury exhibit diverse pathological changes, including disruption of axonal transport, neurofilament compaction and degradation, myelin sheath disruption, and loss of sodium channels required for action potential generation and propagation. These distinct forms of axonal pathology may evolve differentially over time and preferentially localize to specific white matter tracts. In this study, we employed the clinically relevant ferret model of concussion using the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA). 55 male ferrets were randomly allocated to sham or injury groups and then to either 24 h, 72 h, or 14d survival time points. We confirmed that axonal transport disruption and neurofilament pathology represent independent processes, with minimal colocalization but a shared peak of around 72 h following injury. Furthermore, we observed a persistent loss of ankyrin-G, a critical anchoring protein for sodium channels at the node of Ranvier, up to 14d postinjury, suggesting that the resultant impairment in axonal transmission may underlie many concussion symptoms. Indeed, injured ferrets displayed significant deficits in balance, working memory, spatial memory, and recognition memory. These findings demonstrate that the CHIMERA model in ferrets recapitulates key axonal pathologies and their associated clinical manifestations following concussion. This model offers a valuable platform for investigating the temporal evolution of axonal injury and developing targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate concussion-related deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00217-6?rss=yes">Lessons from ex vivo and in vitro models in microglia research</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that dynamically adapt to their microenvironment to achieve multiple housekeeping roles. While ex vivo and in vitro models are instrumental tools to study microglial function, the slicing or culturing process inherently leads to markedly altered microglial phenotypes. Understanding the nature of these limitations and developing better ex vivo and in vitro models are crucial for enhancing the utility of these methods. In this review, we discuss recent developments in ex vivo and in vitro microglia models, from cell cultures to brain slices, focusing on the mechanisms that may need to be considered when using these tools and interpreting the obtained results. We suggest that limitations of ex vivo and in vitro models also provide opportunities to better understand the mechanisms driving microglial phenotype changes in various disease states.

                Ziegler et al. reveal distinct genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral small vessel disease within neurovascular cells, identifying immune-related AD risk and broad neurovascular involvement in SVD. They highlight novel regulatory pathways and potential therapeutic targets, advancing understanding of these comorbid conditions for future treatment strategies.

                The information stored in a silent engram cannot be accessed by normal sensory retrieval cues but can be accessed in the short term by direct optogenetic reactivation. Silent engrams can be un-silenced persistently by restoring functional integrity of engram neurons during times of high engram activity (following memory retrieval attempt or optogenetic engram reactivation).

They found that NPS are required for proper cell identity for most, but not all, lineages, likely through nuclear and cytoplasmic reprogramming.

Wu et al. reveal that circulating FABP5 released from dying macrophages binds to TLR4’s cytoplasmic domain in neighboring viable macrophages, activating MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways to potentiate inflammatory cascades during sepsis.

                Chen et al. investigate the parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF) as a key hub for emotional valence and depression. Two distinct subpopulations in PF mediate appetitive and aversive behaviors via projecting to the ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray, respectively. Their dysregulation under stress leads to altered valence responses and depression-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104530">Dissociation of the nuclear basket triggers chromosome loss in aging yeast</a></h4>

              
                In many organisms, aging is a clear risk factor for chromosome missegregation, the main source of aneuploidy. Here, we report that old yeast cells lose chromosomes by partitioning them asymmetrically to their daughter cells together with the pre-existing (old) spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent in yeast). Strikingly, remodelling of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the displacement of its nuclear basket triggered these asymmetric chromosome segregation events. Simultaneously, nuclear basket displacement caused unspliced pre-mRNAs to leak into the cytoplasm. We show that removing the introns of three genes involved in chromosome segregation was sufficient to fully suppress chromosome loss in old cells. Promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells also caused asymmetric chromosome partitioning and loss through the same three introns. Therefore, we propose that basket displacement from NPCs and its consequences for pre-mRNA quality control are key triggers of aging phenotypes such as aneuploidy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102529">Companion cells with high florigen production express other small proteins and reveal a nitrogen-sensitive FT repressor</a></h4>

              
                The precise onset of flowering is crucial for successful reproduction. In longer days, the florigen gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) is induced in specific leaf phloem companion cells in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. However, the molecular nature of these cells remains elusive. Here, we utilized bulk nuclei RNA-seq and single nuclei RNA (snRNA)-seq to investigate transcription in <i>FT</i>-expressing cells and other companion cells. Our bulk nuclei RNA-seq demonstrated that <i>FT</i>-expressing cells in cotyledons and true leaves showed differences in <i>FT</i> repressor gene expression. Within true leaves, our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that companion cells with high <i>FT</i> expression form a unique cluster. The cluster expresses other genes encoding small proteins, including the flowering and stem growth inducer FPF1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (FLP1) and the anti-florigen BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT). We also found that the promoters of <i>FT</i> and the genes co-expressed with <i>FT</i> in the cluster were enriched for the binding motif of NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1). Overexpression of <i>NIGT1.2</i> and <i>NIGT1.4</i> repressed <i>FT</i> and delayed flowering under nitrogen-rich conditions, implying the roles of NIGT1s as nitrogen-dependent <i>FT</i> repressors. Taken together, our results indicate that unique <i>FT</i>-expressing phloem cells may produce multiple systemic signals to regulate plant growth and development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107454">OpenSpliceAI provides an efficient modular implementation of SpliceAI enabling easy retraining across nonhuman species</a></h4>

              
                The SpliceAI deep learning system is currently one of the most accurate methods for identifying splicing signals directly from DNA sequences. However, its utility is limited by its reliance on older software frameworks and human-centric training data. Here, we introduce OpenSpliceAI, a trainable, open-source version of SpliceAI implemented in PyTorch to address these challenges. OpenSpliceAI supports both training from scratch and transfer learning, enabling seamless retraining on species-specific datasets and mitigating human-centric biases. Our experiments show that it achieves faster processing speeds and lower memory usage than the original SpliceAI code, allowing large-scale analyses of extensive genomic regions on a single GPU. Additionally, OpenSpliceAI’s flexible architecture makes for easier integration with established machine learning ecosystems, simplifying the development of custom splicing models for different species and applications. We demonstrate that OpenSpliceAI’s output is highly concordant with SpliceAI. In silico mutagenesis analyses confirm that both models rely on similar sequence features, and calibration experiments demonstrate similar score probability estimates.

">The Impact of Different Learning Processes on Acquisition, Transfer, and Proprioception in Complex Motor Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill learning involves multiple mechanisms, including use-dependent learning (UDL), reinforcement learning (RL), and error-based learning (EBL). These operate over different time scales and neural pathways, contributing uniquely to skill acquisition, consolidation, and transfer. Here we asked how these mechanisms support the acquisition of a spatially complex maze navigation task in five groups of healthy young adults. Groups received one of five types of feedback during training of their unseen dominant hand: UDL (no feedback), RL (binary success/failure feedback with a static threshold), RLA (binary feedback with an adaptive threshold), RLB (binary feedback with adaptive threshold and brief flash of cursor feedback), or EBL (continuous real-time cursor feedback). Skill, transfer, and proprioceptive acuity were assessed pre- and post- training using a speed-accuracy function (SAF) for each hand and a two-alternative forced-choice shape discrimination task. Results showed that UDL and RL groups exhibited no improvement post-training, while EBL, RLA, and RLB groups demonstrated accuracy improvements. EBL and RLB participants experienced a significant reduction in movement variability, with EBL showing a greater decrease compared to UDL. The left-hand SAF revealed improvements in accuracy across all groups except UDL. All groups showed reduced variability in the left hand, suggesting intermanual transfer, with EBL transferring more variability improvements than UDL. No significant proprioceptive changes were observed in any group. These findings provide new insights into motor skill learning, emphasizing that even minimal feedback can facilitate complex skill acquisition and transfer and has significant implications for studies where error-based learning may not be applicable.

">Symmetry breaking and avalanche shapes in modular neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson-Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (SL and SH) and "broken symmetry" (B1, B2, ...) phases. The phase SL (SH) is characterized by the same low (high) activity in all the modules, while the Bm phases are characterized by a high activity in m modules and low activity in the remaining modules. Between SL and SH, and between SL and B1, there are two lines of critical points, where the system shows a critical behaviour, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Along these lines, avalanche shapes differ systematically: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the SL-SH transition, but can become left-skewed over intermediate durations along the SL-B1 critical line. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.

">SimulScan and Partial Least Squares: Visualizing swallowing through functional and dynamic imaging correlations</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Swallowing is a complex function involving the precise coordination of muscles, nerves, and brain areas, and can be disrupted in a variety of neurological conditions. Current imaging studies to visualize the central control of swallowing cannot examine both the biomechanics of the swallow and the brain activity associated with swallow events. An updated version of SimulScan is introduced that provides high-quality and high-speed dynamic imaging, together with fMRI acquisitions, to enable data-driven analysis of swallowing function through a partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis. Methods: Integrating updated dynamic imaging approaches, SimulScan can achieve dynamic MRI at 23.75 frames per second and BOLD fMRI at a 1.6 s TR. Five subjects were recruited and scanned with SimulScan twice and with videofluoroscopy to compare the preliminary reliability of measuring swallowing biomechanics and the test-retest relationship in correlated functional and dynamic components of PLSC. Results: High reliability of biomechanical measures of swallowing were achieved across the two SimulScan runs. In addition, these showed moderate correlation with videofluorscopy measures. Correlations between dynamic and functional imaging across runs also showed high reliability indicating that SimulScan with PLSC can extract maps of linked correlations between the brain and the oropharyngeal region. Conclusion: The updated version of SimulScan with PLSC analysis enables the study of central control of swallowing, providing simultaneous biomechanical visualization of the swallow along with brain functional signals.

">Disrupting action control with transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation: a step forward for Tourette syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Background: While Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterised by the presence of tics, premonitory urges are involved in both triggering them and as a lever to control them. The right insular cortex is known to play a key role in these processes, yet its precise functional contribution remains unclear. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is currently one of the only non-invasive neuromodulation techniques capable of safely and precisely modulating the activity of deep brain structures such as the insula. Objective: This study used TUS to causally investigate the respective roles of the anterior and posterior insula in urge and action control during a blink suppression task. Methods: Twenty healthy adults underwent three TUS sessions targeting the right anterior insula, posterior insula, and posterior ventricle (control site) in a within-subject, crossover design. Behavioural outcomes included blink counts and urge ratings. Additionally, voxel-based correlations were conducted to further estimate the role of each reached area with acoustic stimulation, allowing for a better mechanical understanding. Results: TUS of the anterior insula induced a clear and acute increase in blink frequency without altering urge, reinforced by voxel-based analyses, confirming its role in voluntary action control. Posterior insula stimulation induced delayed increases in both blinks and urge, which are essentially explained by an involuntary stimulation of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Ventricular stimulation unexpectedly reduced blink frequency during the stimulation only, correlated with acoustic energy delivered within the posterior internal capsule. No significant side effects or temperature rises were observed. Conclusions: These findings provide the first causal evidence that TUS can modulate the two main features of TS: premonitory urge and action control. Distinct effects across targets highlight the anterior insula's critical role in action control and suggest the internal capsule as a potential therapeutic target for TS.

">Stimulus-specific recruitment of human amygdala neurons predicts episodic memory encoding success</a></h4>

              
                Controlling whether a given experience is encoded into long-term memory and thus later remembered is a crucial component of our memory system whose failure is often at the root of memory disorders. One brain area that takes part in controlling which experiences are remembered is the amygdala, but the mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. Here we examined single-neuron activity and local field potentials as human participants performed recognition memory tasks with visual stimuli. Category-selective amygdala neurons exhibited elevated firing rates during encoding of later remembered items versus forgotten items. This subsequent memory effect was restricted to images of the preferred category of a given cell, was stronger and appeared earlier in the amygdala compared to the hippocampus, and did not depend on the valence and arousal of the stimuli. In contrast, category selective cells immediately upstream in the ventral temporal cortex did not exhibit a subsequent memory effect, highlighting specificity to the amygdala. Successful memory formation was accompanied by enhanced spike-field coherence between the activity of category cells in the amygdala and hippocampal field potentials. These findings, replicated in two large independent datasets with two different tasks, demonstrate that recruitment of stimulus-specific amygdala representations predicts episodic memory formation, particularly in the right amygdala. This data suggests category cells in the right amygdala as a cellular target for interventions to treat memory disorders in humans.

">A brain-wide, trial- and time-dependent deterministic drive for self-initiated action decisions</a></h4>

              
                Deciding when to act in the absence of external cues is essential for exploration, learning and survival. Yet how the brain makes such decisions remains controversial, with current models favoring either deterministic or stochastic underpinnings. We performed large-scale, single-unit recordings across eight brain areas in mice self-initiating voluntary actions. We found that action timing is predictable from neural activity, up to several seconds before action initiation, across all eight brain areas. This predictive activity reflects a deterministic drive whose initial value and rate vary trial-by-trial, and whose rate accelerates within trials. While noise contributes to timing variability, the deterministic drive is sufficient to trigger action. Thus, self-initiated timing decisions arise from a variable, brain-wide deterministic drive, challenging models where noise is the primary driver.

">Behavioural and neuronal insights into multisensory combination of unpracticed cues.</a></h4>

              
                Effective decision-making requires integrating multiple information sources, weighted by their reliability and context. While classic studies show near-optimal cue combination with well-learned signals and extensive feedback, everyday choices often rely on unfamiliar or cross-modal cues without such training. We examined cue combination under these conditions using an online perceptual estimation task in large and diverse participant cohorts. Participants combined unpracticed cues, including visual motion direction, spatial visual information, and auditory location, with minimal feedback and occasional cue conflict. Integration strategies varied with age and self-reported ADHD or Autism. Visual cues were combined near-optimally, whereas audio-visual combinations exhibited winner-take-all behaviour, typically but not always favouring the more reliable cue. To test the generality of these findings, we used electrical microstimulation in non-human primates, targeting unimodal or cross-modal association areas. Stimulation of visual cortex was integrated with sensory motion cues, while stimulation of prefrontal cortex promoted winner-take-all choices. These findings suggest universal circuit-level distinctions between within- and across-modality integration, with deviations potentially diagnostic for neuropsychiatric conditions.

">Effect of Large Language Models on P300 Speller Performance with Cross-Subject Training</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, rapidly impairs communication within years of onset. This loss of communication necessitates assistive technologies to restore interaction and independence. One such technology, the P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI), translates EEG signals into text by tracking a subjects neural responses to highlighted characters on a screen. A central challenge in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster and more efficient user interaction. In this context, this study addresses key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Specifically, we introduce three key innovations:- Advanced multi-subject classifier training- Integrating and evaluating impact of numerous large language models (LLMs) on speller performance- Determining P300 LLM performance bounds using an ideal LLM with perfect prediction We conduct extensive simulations using randomly sampled EEG data. Our results demonstrate substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The magnitude of improvement depends on the type of language model used. More specifically, character-level models provide typing speed improvements of approximately 10%, while open-source LLMs such as Llama, Mistral and GPT2 achieve around 40% improvement through efficient word prediction. Additionally, we construct an ideal LLM to establish theoretical performance limits and show that many modern LLMs achieve performance levels within 10% of it. Further, we show that these LLM-driven speed improvements generalize across classifiers, including those designed to reduce subject-specific training.

">Tegmental atrophy in isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: Ex vivo-informed in vivo imaging</a></h4>

              
                Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is an early-stage synucleinopathy characterized by brainstem pathology. In rodents, the pontine tegmentum contains an REM sleep centre, the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD), which expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP). While the involvement of brainstem pathophysiology is thus implicated in iRBD, its solid evidence remains scarce in humans due to the difficulty in identifying small brainstem nuclei with conventional MRI technology alone. Here, we aimed to detect tegmental atrophy in iRBD with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis combined with a novel human brainstem atlas. Structural MRIs from 98 patients with iRBD and 114 controls were analysed to investigate grey matter volume (GMV) using VBM. Our unique approach involved detailed assessments of the VBM results, guided by a high-resolution MRI-based atlas of the human brainstem. This brainstem atlas was founded on ex vivo MRI of 10 postmortem human specimens. We validated it with CRHBP immunostaining, which aided in identifying putative REM sleep-regulating nuclei in humans. We applied this brainstem atlas to identify atrophy in specific brainstem regions in iRBD and correlate their volumes with clinical measures, including autonomic functions. VBM revealed a focal cluster of grey matter atrophy in the dorsal pontine tegmentum of iRBD patients, including the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, ventral part (LDTgV) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PTg). Our atlas-based analysis confirmed the LDTgV as the site of most conspicuous atrophy, revealing a significant volume reduction in iRBD patients compared to controls with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.46, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.019). Furthermore, greater atrophy in the LDTgV and the PTg was associated with more severe autonomic dysfunction as measured by Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT) scores (partial r = -0.237, p = 0.019 and partial r = -0.236, p = 0.019, respectively). Histological analysis confirmed that the LDTgV is selectively enriched with CRHBP-positive neurons, a putative marker for REM sleep-on neurons. We provided novel evidence for the involvement of LDTgV, the putative human homolog of the murine SLD, in iRBD. The present findings advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of iRBD and will contribute to the development of early biomarkers for -synucleinopathies.

">Brain insulin signaling restores deficits in striatal dopamine release in overweight male mice with preexisting low D2-receptor expression</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is characterized by insulin resistance, motivational impairments, and, in some cases, reduced availability of dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. However, whether the low D2 receptor levels represent a predisposing factor or a consequence of obesity, and how these processes are mechanistically linked, remains unclear. Here, we directly tested this causal relationship by selectively reducing D2 receptor density in striatal neurons. Male, but not female, mice with a low density of striatal D2 receptors consumed more food, gained more weight, and developed metabolic features of peripheral insulin resistance despite being maintained on standard chow. Motivational deficits preceded weight gain, manifesting as delayed circadian locomotor onset, reduced physical activity, and diminished effort to obtain food. In the brain, male mice with low D2 receptor density showed reduced dopamine release capacity and age-dependent alterations in brain insulin sensitivity. Prior to weight gain, brain insulin responses were blunted compared to those of controls, in which insulin potentiates dopamine release and enhances striatal acetylcholine signaling. Once overweight, however, these mice exhibited brain insulin hypersensitivity, with insulin strongly restoring dopamine release capacity. Together, these findings demonstrate that low striatal D2 receptor density predisposes male mice to an obesity-like phenotype through early dopaminergic dysfunction that precedes weight gain and is later compensated by insulin hypersensitivity in the brain.

">Sustained dynamics and modality-specific network reconfigurations define crossmodal prediction error</a></h4>

              
                Predictive processing theories posit that the brain continuously generates expectations about incoming sensory inputs, updating them through prediction errors. While extensively studied within single modalities, it remains unclear how prediction errors unfold when expectations and violations occur across different senses. Using a local-global hierarchical oddball paradigm combined with high-density EEG in 47 participants, we contrasted unimodal and crossmodal prediction errors across auditory, visual, and somatosensory domains. We found that crossmodal violations elicit temporally sustained cortical responses which diverge from the transient, localised dynamics observed for unimodal prediction errors. Temporal decoding revealed that crossmodal effects maintain shared prolonged neural representations, suggestive of supramodal integration across all levels of cortical processing. Computational modelling further demonstrated that crossmodal prediction errors reorganize effective connectivity within and between sensory hierarchies, engaging distinct early cortical pathways depending on the sensory combination. Our findings refine hierarchical predictive coding for crossmodal transitions by demonstrating that, unlike unimodal prediction errors, crossmodal prediction errors recruit dedicated prolonged supramodal representations and flexibly adapted modality-specific networks.

">From optimality to reality: decision-making in basal ganglia output</a></h4>

              
                Value-based decision-making requires translating abstract representations of alternative values into concrete decisions. Although this process is widespread, the neural mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unclear. Here, we address this question by examining neural dynamics in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) of two monkeys performing a decision-making task. We found a dynamic shift in SNpr activity during the decision process. Before choice, SNpr activity encoded the optimal selection regardless of the eventual action taken, representing the action and value of the optimal choice even when the non-optimal target was ultimately selected. During choice, the SNpr shifted to code the actual selection made by the monkey. This pattern was reinforced by trials with suboptimal choices, revealing a clear transition in SNpr coding from representing the abstract value of the optimal selection to encoding the chosen action, thus suggesting a neural mechanism that transforms value representations into concrete decisions.

">Temporal dynamics of noradrenaline release at fine spatial scales during motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Noradrenaline (NA) released from the locus coeruleus (LC) has been known to play pivotal roles in arousal, sensory processing, decision-making, and learning through global release across the entire neocortex. Recent studies have demonstrated heterogeneous and modular NA release in distinct brain regions and highlighted its spatiotemporal dynamics across the neocortex. However, the spatiotemporal specificity of NA release at fine scales within a single brain region remains unclear, and it has not been reported whether the release patterns evolve functionally throughout prolonged learning processes such as motor skill acquisition. Here, by employing in vivo two-photon imaging with various genetically encoded NA sensors, we reveal that behavior-induced NA release in the primary motor cortex (M1) is spatially heterogeneous at the scale of local microcircuitry. Over the course of learning, the release pattern is locally refined, achieving consistent spatial precision within M1. Intriguingly, pharmacological manipulations that disrupt the spatial specificity also alter local neurons activity and representations. Furthermore, LC-NA axonal calcium imaging uncovered two distinct temporal activity patterns, in which non-behavior-related rapid axonal activity (sub-second duration events) profoundly affect the temporally precise behavior-induced persistent axonal activity (seconds duration events). Closed-loop optogenetic manipulations that bi-directionally modulate non-behavior-related rapid events directly impacted the learning process. Together, our results provide novel insights into the temporal dynamics of NA release at fine spatial scales within one brain region and underscore the critical role of local NA specificity in regulating circuit plasticity during motor skill acquisition.

">Crosstalk between the Methyl-Cytosine Dioxygenase TET3 and the Methyl-CpG-binding protein MECP2 Controls Neuronal Maturation</a></h4>

              
                Active DNA demethylation depends on Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) enzymes, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further derivatives. Mutations in TET3, encoding the predominant neuronal isoform, lead to Beck-Fahrner syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Using human iPSC-derived neurons, we show that TET3 is dispensable for neuronal specification but critical for subsequent maturation. Differentiating TET3-deficient neurons exhibit delayed transcriptional and proteomic transitions, altered synaptic signatures, and impaired network activity, indicating delayed functional maturation. Mechanistically, we identified an interaction between TET3 and the mC/hmC-binding protein MECP2, pathogenic variants of which cause Rett syndrome. MECP2 negatively regulates TET3 activity, as demonstrated in functional assays and by inverse hmC patterns in MECP2- and TET3-deficient neurons. Despite this, MECP2- and TET3-deficient neurons exhibit highly similar phenotypes later in differentiation. Our findings uncover a functional interplay between TET3 and MECP2 that coordinates DNA methylation and chromatin dynamics during neuronal maturation, suggesting a shared pathogenic mechanism in Beck-Fahrner and Rett syndromes.

">DISTINCT NEURAL SIGNATURES OF HIPPOCAMPAL POPULATION DYNAMICS DURING LOCOMOTION-IN-PLACE</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal CA1 neurons modulate their activity with movement variables such as time, distance, and speed, yet it remains unclear how these representations reorganize across behavioral states, from externally driven to self-paced movement and immobility. Here, we investigated how sensory events that initiate or terminate locomotion, structure CA1 population codes and how these codes reorganize across sensory-driven locomotion, spontaneous locomotion, and forced immobility. Using two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Thy1-GCaMP mice (n = 5) performing the air-induced running task on a non-motorized conveyor belt, we examined neuronal firing-rate modulation across a series of behavioral configurations designed to probe distinct forms of locomotion-in-place. In the No-Brake (locomotion-permitted) condition, the belt rotated freely, allowing animals to execute full cyclic limb movements in response to air stimulation. In the Brake (immobility) condition, the belt was fixed, restricting movement to partial or attempted locomotor motions. Firing-rate modulation with respect to time, distance, and speed was quantified using linear (Pearson correlation) and nonlinear (mutual information) metrics under permutation testing in the natural reference domains. Behaviorally, air stimuli produced faster, sustained running during air-on and more variable, self-paced movement during air-off. Neurally, a larger fraction of CA1 cells was active and significantly modulated during air-off. Within the modulated set, singularly tuned cells (time, distance, or speed) predominated over mixed-tuned cells, and speed-modulated cells peaked earlier after stimulus onset or offset than time- or distance-modulated cells. Under Brake, CA1 activity was predominantly singularly tuned to time or movement-in-place, with stronger movement modulation and engagement post-stimulation. Despite substantial single-cell turnover across configurations and phases, population-level analyses revealed a coherent, air-phase-locked organization and distinct movement-related populations across Brake and No-Brake conditions. These results indicate a state-dependent reweighting of sensorimotor features implemented atop a conserved ensemble scaffold in CA1.

                Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels determine key functional neuronal properties. Their activity is modulated by subunit composition and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. Using an antibody directed against a phosphotyrosine (Y458) located in the C-terminal tail of Kv1.2, we identified yet unreported high molecular weight forms of Kv1.2 among them, a phosphorylated and heavily glycosylated 100 kDa form. Owing to the significant downregulation of Kv 1.2 in LGI1-dependent autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, we investigated, in total brain and the hippocampal formation of both WT and Lgi1-/- mice, the distribution of phosphoY458 Kv1.2 and we compared their respective proteomic interactomes with those of Kv1.2. In addition to major differences between the interactomes of pY458 Kv1.2 and Kv 1.2 in WT and Lgi1-/-, we found a major reshaping of pY458Kv1.2 molecular neighbourhood between WT and Lgi1-/- as well as a significant upregulation of the glycosylated form in Lgi1-/- .

">Inhibitory-stabilization is sufficient for history-dependent computation in a randomly connected attractor network</a></h4>

              
                For effective information processing, the response to a sensory stimulus should depend on both the incoming stimulus and the history of prior stimuli. Existing models of neural circuits based on multiple attractor states produced with strong self-excitation can exhibit these properties, but they do not stabilize at biologically realistic firing rates. We demonstrate how a randomly connected inhibition-stabilized attractor network can preserve the computational abilities of recurrent excitatory networks, while stabilizing at arbitrarily low firing rates. Not only does excitatory-inhibitory balance stabilize network activity, inhibitory-stabilization also plays a functional role in history-dependent computation: transient oscillations made possible by inhibitory feedback are sufficient for state-dependent responses to stimulation. Such networks may underlie many cognitive tasks, suggesting a functional role for inhibition-stabilized dynamics in cortical computation.

">Connectivity biases generate a learning hierarchy in the Drosophila mushroom body</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory centers must balance maximizing coding capacity with prioritizing biologically relevant information. Expansion layers, a circuit motif common to many learning and memory centers, including the insect mushroom body, transform dense sensory representations into sparse, distributed ones, and theoretical models propose that random connectivity within these layers maximizes coding capacity by generating highly discriminable responses. Yet this solution creates a fundamental problem: purely random connectivity treats all stimuli equally, without prioritizing survival-relevant cues over neutral ones. Here, we show that the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body resolves this capacity-selectivity trade-off through systematic biases in projection neuron-Kenyon cell connectivity. Although connectivity is random at the single-cell level, some projection neuron types connect up to 15-fold more frequently than others. These biases translate directly into function: Kenyon cell responses scales with projection neuron connectivity, and the breadth of odor-evoked responses predicts learning performance. Odors activating more than 20% of Kenyon cells drive robust associative memories, whereas those activating fewer than 10% are poorly learned. VL1 projection neurons are a notable exception: despite their weak connectivity, they elicit broad Kenyon cell activity but fail to support learning, revealing a circuit-level gate on learning. These results show that the mushroom body embeds a learning hierarchy in its connectivity architecture, prioritizing ethologically relevant odors while preserving coding capacity for diverse associations.

">A sleep promoting role of phototransduction in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Daily sleep-wake cycle is a conserved behaviour defined by locomotion quiescence and enhanced responsive threshold to sensory stimuli. Both circadian rhythm and a homeostatic process determine the daily sleep profile, which is also regulated by environmental light, a major sensory input to regulate circadian rhythm and alertness. With decades of investigation in Drosophila, the cellular and circuital mechanism underlying light-mediated circadian synchronization are well-established, yet the direct relationship between light/visual input and sleep remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we have started an investigatory survey of sleep behaviour using classic mutant lines to manipulate phototransduction and downstream neural transmission. We observed consistent day sleep fragmentation in flies with mutations in multiple phototransduction components. We also found hyperpolarised Drosophila photoreceptor resulted in shorter day sleep. We found a severe reduction in locomotor speed in several visual mutants during normal waking time preventing assessment of their sleep-linked immobility. In summary, we provide a rigorous quantification of several phototransduction genes and reveal the key role of visual input to promote sleep.

">Stimulation with ECoG electrodes modulates cortical activity and sensory processing in the awake mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation has been widely used to probe neural network properties and treat dysfunction. Electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes, long used for activity monitoring, can also stimulate the brain in a minimally invasive and chronic manner. However, how cortical surface electrical stimulation impacts cortical network activity remains poorly understood. Using in vivo calcium imaging in the awake mouse brain with chronically implanted ECoG electrodes, we measured how electrical stimulation modulates the activity of visual cortical neurons, including during concurrent visual stimulation. We found that cortical surface electrical stimulation initially activates L2/3 neurons followed by prolonged inhibition lasting seconds after stimulation. Electrical stimulation suppresses the activity of neurons at their preferred grating orientation but enhances their responses to non-preferred visual stimuli, thereby reducing sensory feature selectivity. By measuring how electrical stimulation modulates the activity of inhibitory neuron subtypes including PV, SST, and NDNF interneurons, we propose a circuit model in which L1 NDNF interneurons are strongly activated by cortical electrical stimulation and, in turn, inhibit L2/3 excitatory neurons and PV interneurons through volume transmission of GABA.

">Dissociable Roles of Primary Motor and Supplementary Motor Cortex in Shaping the Neural Drive to Muscle</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) are critical for motor execution and planning, yet their distinct causal contributions to modulating the neural drive to muscles remain incompletely understood. To dissociate their roles, we applied inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M1, SMA, or a sham condition in 72 healthy participants and characterized the activity of single motor units from high-density EMG recorded during a sustained isometric contraction. Our results revealed a clear functional divergence. M1 inhibition produced a direct failure of motor output, causing a rapid force decline compared to sham, which was strongly correlated with a reduction in motor unit firing rates. Conversely, SMA inhibition did not impair net force. Instead, it altered the fundamental structure of the motor command, compelling a compensatory strategy characterized by a reliance on smaller-amplitude motor units with lower firing rates and a marked degradation of the low-frequency (delta-band) coherence that organizes stable output. These results provide direct causal evidence that M1 directly dictates the magnitude of motor output via population firing rates, while SMA orchestrates the composition and temporal structure of the active motor unit pool to generate an efficient and stable command.

">Aerobic Exercise Intensity: A Dose-Response Effect on Motor Adaptation and Learning</a></h4>

              
                Acute aerobic exercise (AEX) can enhance motor learning. While AEX intensity likely plays a key role, there is mixed evidence for AEX-enhanced motor skill acquisition and learning across a spectrum of exercise intensities. This may stem, in part, from inconsistent AEX parameters (i.e., intensity, structure, and duration) employed within and across studies. Additionally, evidence suggests that AEX can enhance a specific form of motor learning, namely motor adaptation. Moderate- and high-intensity AEX can increase motor adaptation, but evidence remains limited and inconsistent. Hence, the impact of AEX intensity on motor adaptation remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of AEX intensity on motor adaptation, while controlling for AEX structure and duration. Eighty young adults were assigned to four cycling AEX/Rest groups (n=20/group): 20 min of light (LIIT), moderate (MIIT), or high (HIIT) intensity interval training, or Rest (control). AEX consisted of four 3-min cycling intervals (LIIT, 35% heart rate reserve [HRR]; MIIT, 55%HRR; HIIT, 80%HRR) and 2-min active recovery (25%HRR). Participants practiced a visuomotor rotation task immediately after AEX/Rest (adaptation) and at a no-AEX 24 h retention test (motor learning). We found that: (1) all AEX intensities enhanced motor learning compared to Rest, and (2) HIIT enhanced motor adaptation and learning to the greatest extent, followed by MIIT then LIIT. This is the first study to demonstrate a dose-response effect of AEX intensity on motor adaptation and learning. Our results highlight the importance of considering intensity when prescribing AEX in sports and clinical contexts to promote motor learning.

">Acetylation of Axonal G3BP1 through ELP3 Accelerates Axon Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Nerve injury triggers localized translation of axonal mRNAs to respond to injury and nerve regeneration. The core stress granule protein G3BP1 sequesters axonal mRNAs in granules before and after axotomy. G3BP1 granule disassembly can be regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation of S149 phosphorylation and acetylation of human K376 (mouse K374). Axonal G3BP1 undergoes phosphorylation after axotomy, but acetylation of G3BP1 in axons was unknown. Here we show that rodent G3BP1 undergoes K374 acetylation after axotomy is ELP3-dependent, which enhances axonal protein synthesis, accelerates nerve regeneration, and supports functional recovery. ELP3-depleted neurons exhibit reduced axon growth and increased axonal G3BP1 granules. The proximal axons degenerate rapidly despite maintaining soma connectivity, an effect prevented by expression of acetylmimetic G3BP1.Together, these findings identify G3BP1 acetylation via ELP3 as a critical regulator of both axonal regeneration and neuronal resilience, revealing a post-translational mechanism that links stress granule regulation to neuronal repair and protection.

How these processes adapt across sensory modalities and their neural mechanisms remains unclear. This cross-sectional study tested whether proactive slowing and reactive inhibition are adaptable across sensory modalities and supported by shared and distinct neural adaptations. We recruited 23 athletes and 21 age-matched controls. Participants performed a choice-reaction task, requiring rapid response selection, and a stop-signal task, requiring occasional cancelation of initiated responses. Proactive slowing and reactive inhibition were assessed across visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities. Proactive slowing was measured by anticipatory response slowing, and reactive inhibition by stop-signal reaction time. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to examine neural processing. Athletes exhibited greater proactive slowing and reactive inhibition than controls across all modalities. ERP analyses revealed that proactive slowing was associated with greater N2 and smaller P3 amplitudes in athletes, suggesting enhanced early conflict monitoring and reduced reliance on later attentional control. Athletes showed greater N2 amplitudes for reactive inhibition, indicating superior stimulus-driven inhibition, similar to proactive slowing. These findings provide novel evidence that both proactive slowing and reactive inhibition adapt across sensory modalities, accompanied by neural changes that are partly shared (N2) and partly distinct (P3).</span>

                <p>Psychedelic drugs have garnered increasing attention for their therapeutic potential in treating a variety of psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. The claustrum (CLA), a brain area with remarkable interconnectivity to frontal cortices, has recently been shown to have a dense population of serotonin 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) that are activated by psychedelics. Because psychedelic therapy can require as little as one treatment session, it has been speculated that psychedelics achieve their long-term remedial effects by inducing neuroplasticity in brain areas responsible for psychiatric disease states, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the effects of psychedelics on synaptic plasticity in serotonin receptor-rich brain areas remain entirely unexplored. We applied presynaptic stimuli paired with postsynaptic action potentials (APs) to a subpopulation of CLA neurons projecting to ACC in male rats to find that the psychedelic drug, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), reverses the polarity of synaptic plasticity from long-term depression (LTD) to long-term potentiation (LTP) in a manner that may reflect contribution of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission but is specific to synapses activated by local electrical stimulation. Additionally, we characterize intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CLA&ndash;ACC neurons with and without DOI application, noting several changes to AP dynamics induced by DOI. These findings align with the view that psychedelics induce rapid and lasting synaptic plasticity and strengthen the hypothesis that claustrocortical circuits are highly sensitive to psychedelic drug action.</p>

                <p>Experimental design is a core competency of scientific training with profound implications for research rigor and reproducibility. Yet, trainees often receive minimal guidance to structure their thinking around experimental design. Metacognition&mdash;reflecting on one's own thinking&mdash;offers a powerful tool to strengthen reasoning in this process. Here, we present the AiMS framework, which adapts the classic plan&ndash;monitor&ndash;evaluate cycle of metacognition to the context of experimental design. This framework emphasizes three iterative stages&mdash;Awareness, Analysis, and Adaptation&mdash;that scaffold reflection on an experimental system defined by its Models, Methods, and Measurements and evaluated through Specificity, Sensitivity, and Stability. We illustrate application of the AiMS framework through an interactive neuroanatomy case study and provide a structured worksheet to guide readers in applying it to their own experiments. We also highlight how the framework can assist researchers in organizing their ideas for research proposals and explore the responsible use of generative AI as a metacognitive partner that supports structured reflection without supplanting original intellectual contributions. The AiMS framework complements other principles and practices of rigor by foregrounding deliberate reasoning about assumptions, vulnerabilities, and trade-offs. Our goal is to provide practical tools that foster rigor, creativity, and adaptability in the design of biological experiments, supporting both trainees and their mentors in cultivating reflective scientific practices.</p>

                <p>BLTP1 (Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Protein Family Member 1), previously known as Tweek, Kiaa1109, FSA, or 4932438A13Rik, is a nonvesicular lipid transport protein linked to Alkuraya&ndash;Ku&#x010D;inskas syndrome (AKS), an autosomal recessive disorder with severe brain malformations and arthrogryposis in humans. Although BLTP1 is known to be involved in the transfer of phospholipids between organellar membranes at membrane contact sites, its specific role during mammalian development remains poorly defined. Here we characterized the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <I>Bltp1</I> knock-out (<I>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I>) mice of either sex. These mutant mice die perinatally, exhibiting reduced growth of intramuscular motor nerves and a reduction in the size of the NMJ, compared with littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis of the diaphragm muscle in <I>Bltp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> embryos reveals defects in synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release is markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content are reduced. In addition, neuromuscular synapses in <I>Bltp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice fail to respond to a repetitive stimulation. Remarkably, the impairment of intramuscular nerve growth in <I>Bltp1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> embryos is restored by supplementing pregnant dams with lecithin, a mixture of unsaturated phospholipids naturally present in foods, although lecithin supplement does not improve the overall survival of these mutant mice. Together, these results demonstrate that BLTP1 plays important roles during development for proper intramuscular nerve growth and neuromuscular synaptic function and suggest that AKS patients may benefit from phospholipid supplementation such as lecithin.</p>

                <p>Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na<sup>+</sup> increases, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup> signals and properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multiphoton Na<sup>+</sup> imaging combined with whole-cell patch clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of ~10&nbsp;mM. Using intensity-based line scan imaging, we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na<sup>+</sup> along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order, or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of <I>D</I><SUB>Na+</SUB> = 600&nbsp;&micro;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na<sup>+</sup> increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na<sup>+</sup> influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup> within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na<sup>+</sup> transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.</p>

                <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared with typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08&ndash;6.67&nbsp;years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and <I>k</I>-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared with TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons are involved in a wide array of key brain functions including movement control and reward-based learning. They are also critical for major brain disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or schizophrenia. DA neurons projecting to distinct striatal territories are diverse with regard to their molecular makeup and cellular physiology, which are likely to contribute to the observed differences in temporal DA dynamics. Among these regions, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) displays the fastest DA dynamics, which might control the moment-to-moment vigor and variability of voluntary movements. However, the underlying mechanisms for these DLS-specific fast DA fluctuations are unresolved. Here, we show that DLS-projecting DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) possess a unique biophysical profile allowing immediate 10-fold accelerations in discharge frequency via rebound bursting. By using a combination of in vitro patch-clamp recordings in projection-defined DA SN subpopulations from adult male mice and developing matching projection-specific computational models, we demonstrate that a strong interaction of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3 and SK channels specific for DLS-projecting Aldh1a1&ndash;positive DA SN (DLS-DA) neurons controls the gain of fast rebound bursting, while K<SUB>v</SUB>4 and HCN channels mediate timing of rebound excitability. In addition, GIRK channels activated by D2 and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors prevent rebound bursting in these DLS-DA neurons. Furthermore, our in vivo patch-clamp recordings and matching in vivo computational models provide evidence that these unique rebound properties might be preserved in the intact brain, where they might endow specific computational properties well suited for the generation of fast DA dynamics present in DLS.</p>

                <p>Spatial attention is often conceptualized as a flexible "zoom lens" that can dynamically adjust its focus, but most evidence stems from studies of voluntary attention. Our study investigates whether involuntary, reflexive attention exhibits similar adaptability in attentional scope. Using behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) experiments with exogenous cues of varying spatial extent, we examined how attentional gradients dynamically adjust when attention is involuntarily captured. Male and female human participants performed visual search tasks preceded by narrow- or broad-cue displays at different onset asynchronies. We applied inverted encoding models to alpha-band neural activity to precisely track the locus and breadth of attentional tuning. Across experiments, we found that reflexive attentional gradients flexibly adapt to match cue characteristics. Behaviorally, narrow cues yielded progressively sharper attentional gradients compared with broad cues, with differences emerging over time. Critically, EEG analyses revealed that alpha-band activity tracked these dynamic adjustments, with differences in spatial selectivity emerging rapidly (&plusmn;200&nbsp;ms postcue) and continuing to evolve. Contrary to previous suggestions that involuntary attention primarily influences response efficiency, our results demonstrate that exogenous cues modulate attentional resources across the visual field at early processing stages.</p>

                <p>Despite advances in understanding the psychological and social consequences of peer victimization, the immediate effects of bullying on the central nervous system remain elusive. Here we mapped the neural, affective, and attentional responses to simulated bullying in adolescents and adults and tested whether these responses are associated with real-life victimization experiences. Fifty-one adolescents (29 females, 22 males) aged 11&ndash;14&nbsp;years and 47 adults (29 females, 18 males) underwent a functional MRI (fMRI) while watching first-person videos of bullying (victimization) in the school environment, as well as neutral and positive social interactions in a similar setting. Additionally, 57 adults (36 females, 21 males) watched the same videos during an eye tracking experiment. Exposure to bullying versus positive social interaction engaged the socioemotional and threat response systems, as well as regions related to social cognition, sensory and interoceptive processing, and motor control. These responses were consistent across adolescents and adults and were associated with the current and past victimization experiences of the participants. This large-scale activation of neural systems subserving socioemotional, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing was in line with the amplified emotional and attentional responses revealed by larger pupil size and higher fixation frequency during simulated bullying in the eye tracking experiment. Altogether these results highlight how peer victimization evokes a state of stress and alarm in the central nervous system.</p>

                <p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This "handshaking" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>

                <p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<I>DISC1</I>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <I>DISC1</I> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Impaired synaptic inhibition by GABA and glycine contributes to excitatory&ndash;inhibitory imbalance in the spinal cord associated with chronic neuropathic pain; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated how GABAergic and glycinergic inputs regulate synaptic <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn in male and female mice. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-expressing excitatory neurons and vesicular -aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT)-expressing inhibitory neurons exhibited comparable mixed GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Blockade of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors with gabazine or glycine receptors with strychnine potentiated NMDAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, the amplitude of EPSCs monosynaptically evoked from the dorsal root, and puff NMDA currents in VGluT2, but not VGAT, neurons. These effects were abolished by silencing neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin or in <I>Cacna2d1</I> knock-out (KO) mice. In mice with conditional <I>Grin1</I> KO in primary sensory neurons (<I>Grin1</I>-cKO), gabazine and strychnine did not affect mEPSC frequency but still enhanced puff NMDA currents in dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, intrathecal gabazine- or strychnine-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity was diminished by <I>Grin1</I>-cKO, <I>Cacna2d1</I> KO, or &alpha;2-1 C-terminus peptide. Additionally, blocking metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) prevents gabazine- and strychnine-induced increases in NMDAR-mediated mEPSC frequency, evoked EPSCs, and puff NMDA currents in VGluT2 neurons as well as nociceptive hypersensitivity. Our findings reveal that GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition tonically suppresses both presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity at primary afferent-&gt;excitatory neuron synapses. &alpha;2-1 and mGluR5 are essential for disinhibition-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity and synaptic NMDAR hyperactivity in the spinal cord.</p>

                <p>It is still poorly understood how subcortical structures contribute to spontaneous infraslow brain activity. In fact, cortical spontaneous activity is often analyzed in isolation, possibly a result of a long-standing "corticocentric bias". Here, we consider a large cohort of healthy human subjects of either sex (Human Connectome Project database), and we perform a dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analysis to investigate fluctuations of cortical&ndash;subcortical interactions. Our analysis shows that FC shifts in the cortex and the subcortex are synchronized. Two core subcortical "clusters" comprising, respectively, limbic regions (hippocampus and amygdala) and subcortical nuclei (thalamus and basal ganglia) show a temporally flexible coupling with cortical regions. Correspondingly, we consistently observe two recurring FC patterns (states). In State 1, limbic regions couple with the default mode network, and in State 2, they couple with sensorimotor networks. An opposite pattern is observed for the thalamus/basal ganglia. Our findings suggest that cortical&ndash;subcortical interactions contribute to shaping whole-brain spontaneous FC patterns and underline the relevance of including the subcortex in descriptions of large-scale spontaneous brain activity.</p>

                <p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in permanent sensory deficits, significantly impairing the quality of life. These deficits are poorly addressed due to a lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. Here, we utilized a thoracic Level 8 lateral hemisection SCI mouse model (including both male and female mice) and applied a battery of behavioral assays requiring supraspinal transmission of sensory information. We also assessed ascending spinal circuits from the lumbar spinal cord to the brain. By 28&nbsp;d post-SCI, sensory assessments revealed distinct deficits: reduced innocuous sensation in the ipsilateral hindpaw and enhanced sensation in the contralateral hindpaw. Both hindlimbs exhibited disrupted nocifensive behaviors, with chronic neuropathic dysesthesia observed only in the contralateral hindlimb. We provided anatomical evidence to elucidate the neural substrates responsible for these sensory discrepancies. This SCI mouse model mimics key features of human lateral hemisection conditions (Brown&ndash;S&eacute;quard syndrome) and offers a robust platform to explore underlying mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p>Visual object recognition has been extensively studied under fixation conditions, but our natural viewing involves frequent saccadic eye movements that scan multiple local informative features within an object (e.g., eyes and mouth in a face image). These saccades would contribute to object recognition by subserving the integration of sensory information across local features, but mechanistic models underlying this process have yet to be established due to the presumed complexity of the interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems. Here, we employ a framework of perceptual decision making and show that human object categorization behavior with saccades can be quantitatively explained by a model that simply accumulates the sensory evidence available at each moment. Human participants of both sexes performed face and object categorization while they were allowed to freely make saccades to scan local features. Our model could successfully fit the data even during such a free viewing condition, departing from past studies that required controlled eye movements to test trans-saccadic integration. Moreover, further experimental results confirmed that active saccade commands (efference copy) do not substantially contribute to evidence accumulation. Therefore, we propose that object recognition with saccades can be approximated by a parsimonious decision-making model without assuming complex interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems.</p>

                Adequate nutrition is essential during adolescence to support physical growth, cognitive development, and metabolic processes. In Malawi and Ghana, limited dietary diversity and widespread micronutrient deficiencies among adolescents pose significant health challenges. These issues are largely influenced by food insecurity, poverty, and environmental changes. This narrative review examines the nutritional status of adolescents in both countries using data from peer-reviewed studies and policy documents. A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar for studies published between 2014 and 2025. The review focused on dietary patterns, micronutrient status, socio-economic influences, and policy responses. Findings reveal a double burden of malnutrition—undernutrition and rising overweight—especially among adolescent girls. In Malawi, 35% of girls aged 15–19 were anemic; in Ghana, the figure approaches 50%. Poor dietary diversity, food insecurity, and cultural factors contribute to high levels of iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiencies. While school-based nutrition programs and micronutrient supplementation efforts exist, their impact is limited, especially in rural areas. In conclusion, adolescent malnutrition in Malawi and Ghana remains a public health concern, driven by dietary inadequacies and socio-economic disparities, despite ongoing nutrition interventions.

                We present a chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of the hamour, or orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), a high-value and significant teleost fish species across West Indo-Pacific regions of the Middle East, South Africa, and Australia. This species is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishing and it is widely cultured around the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The hamour genome was sequenced from one individual male originating from a wild population in the Arabian Gulf and assembled into a 1.07 Gb assembly, the largest 24 superscaffolds making up 99.9% of the assembly. Annotation of the genome identified 28,384 protein-coding genes, with 98.9% single-copy BUSCO gene completeness (Actinopterygii database). These data will support further studies on functional ecological and evolutionary genomics of this species, enhancing the understanding of its biology and its responses to stressors including pathogens.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represents a major public health challenge in Latin America, with limited epidemiological data available for Honduras. HPV prevalence trends across age groups must be understood to build effective preventative measures. Objective To systematically analyze HPV prevalence among Honduran women from 1990 to 2023 across different age groups, and to project future trends through 2035 using time series forecasting methods. Methods PRISMA 2020 guided our proportions systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Tz’ibalnaah, and SciELO searches found age-stratified HPV prevalence studies in Honduran women from 1990 to 2023. We used MedCalc v19.7.1 for meta-analysis and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing in Python v3.10.3 for prevalence estimations. Model accuracy was measured by RMSE and MAE. Results Four studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing data from 1999 to 2023. The pooled HPV prevalence was 42% (95% CI: 21.8%), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 75%). Age-stratified analysis revealed highest prevalence in women aged 15-24 years (10.65% in 2023, increased from 1.26% in 1999) and declining prevalence in women >35 years. Time series projections indicated continued increasing trends for women <35 years and stabilizing or declining trends for those ≥35 years. The Holt-Winters model demonstrated optimal fit for the 35-44 age group (RMSE=0.26, MAE=0.25), but substantial prediction errors for younger age groups (RMSE=3.77 for ages 25-34) highlight the limitations of forecasting with limited temporal data points. Conclusions HPV prevalence shows divergent age-specific trends in Honduras, with increasing rates among younger women and decreasing rates in older age groups. These findings suggest differential impacts of public health interventions across age cohorts and highlight the need for enhanced vaccination coverage and sexual health education targeting adolescents and young adults. The limited number of temporal observations constrains forecast reliability, emphasizing the need for strengthened epidemiological surveillance systems.

                Intracranial teratomas are rare central nervous system germ cell tumors, and their occurrence within the third ventricle of pediatric patients presents significant surgical challenges owing to the proximity of critical neurovascular structures. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy who presented with hydrocephalus and seizures caused by a large multiloculated cystic and solid mass in the third ventricle. An initial attempt at gross total resection via a transcortical transventricular approach was complicated by a massive, life-threatening hemorrhage upon dissection of the tumor from the ventricular floor, which was suspected to be an injury to the internal cerebral vein. The procedure was aborted, and bleeding was controlled with hemostatic packing. After a 10-day period of stabilization in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient underwent a second craniotomy to remove the packing and resect the tumor. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of mature teratoma. Postoperatively, the patient required a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt to treat persistent hydrocephalus and residual left-sided hemiparesis. This case highlights the profound risk of vascular injury during resection of large intraventricular teratomas. It also demonstrates that a staged surgical approach can be a crucial life-saving strategy for managing severe intraoperative complications, allowing patient stabilization before definitive tumor removal.

                Background Transformational leadership (TL) is widely recognized as a key driver of employee innovative behavior (EIB), particularly in higher education institutions where adaptability and creativity are vital. However, the pathways through which TL promotes innovation remain underexplored in developing-country contexts. This study examines the mediating role of organizational culture (OC) in the relationship between TL and EIB in Ethiopian public research universities. Methods A quantitative design was employed involving 726 academic and administrative staff from three public research universities selected through simple random sampling. Standardized instruments measured four TL dimensions—idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration—alongside EIB and OC. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects and assess measurement reliability and validity through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results The analysis revealed varied direct effects of TL dimensions on EIB: inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect, while idealized influence and individualized consideration showed negative direct effects but strong positive indirect effects via OC. Intellectual stimulation demonstrated minimal direct influence but a substantial indirect positive effect through OC. OC itself exhibited a strong and significant positive relationship with EIB, confirming its mediating role in linking TL with innovation. Model fit indices met recommended thresholds (GFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.934, RMSEA = 0.06), validating the robustness of the model. Conclusions The findings underscore the pivotal mediating role of OC in transforming leadership behaviors into innovative actions among university staff. While some TL dimensions alone may not directly enhance innovation, their influence becomes positive when reinforced by a supportive, adaptive, and participatory organizational culture. The study contributes theoretical and empirical insights into leadership–innovation dynamics in African higher education and offers practical guidance for fostering innovation through culturally aligned leadership strategies.

                Choosing a course of study in a Senior High School in Ghana is a major problem for both students and parents, due to the limited number of Courses Offered. The courses are governed by the national education and curriculum framework. The educational policy guideline provided the main courses as: Agriculture, Business, Technical, Home Economics, Visual Arts, General Arts, and General Science options, irrespective of individual career aspiration. A report made public in 2018 indicated that, education in Ghana is not of good quality, students attend school from basic to secondary level for an average of 12 years, only at half capacity. The outcome of the poor quality of the education system is waste of human capital resources. To address these challenges, the study explored education reform and new policies that brings systematic changes across the entire education system, particularly in the design of courses and curricula. The study employed content analysis based on the Ghana Education Service's 2021 second-cycle school register, and data analyzed from the Ghana Senior High Schools Annual Digest 2019/2020. The methodology employed Common Career Selective Programme, a structured basic education and training programme, designed to help improve the quality of education, and for students to explore within a broader curriculum. The proposal modified the seven main courses into 18 major courses, which consist of a course header, abstract, course description, career options and requirements. The results provided a variety of course options that suit individual innate abilities, focused on the student’s career goals, intensify lesson content, improve quality of education, and advance human resource capacity, providing Education-for-All beyond the year 2030. In conclusion, the study proposed education reform for courses and curricula, to promote basic education knowledge, actionable recommendations, and policy amendments to improve and promote quality education in Ghana, West Africa, and other countries globally.

                <p>by Mattia Zanzi, Francesco G. Rinaldi, Silene Fornasaro, Eugenio Piasini, Davide Zoccolan</p>

The brain combines information from multiple sensory modalities to build a consistent representation of the world. The principles by which multimodal stimuli are integrated in cortical hierarchies are well studied, but it is less clear whether and how unimodal inputs shape the processing of signals carried by a different modality. In rodents, for instance, direct connections from primary auditory cortex reach visual cortex, but studies disagree on the impact of these projections on visual cortical processing. Both enhancement and suppression of visually evoked responses by auditory inputs have been reported, as well as sharpening of orientation tuning and improvement in the coding of visual information. Little is known, however, about the functional impact of auditory signals on rodent visual perception. Here we trained a group of rats in a visual temporal frequency (TF) classification task, where the visual stimuli to categorize were paired with simultaneous but task-irrelevant auditory stimuli, to prevent high-level multisensory integration and investigate instead the spontaneous, direct impact of auditory signals on the perception of visual stimuli. Rat classification of visual TF was strongly and systematically altered by the presence of sounds, in a way that was determined by sound intensity but not by its temporal modulation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we developed a Bayesian ideal observer model, combined with a neural coding scheme where neurons linearly encode visual TF but are inhibited by concomitant sounds by a measure that depends on their intensity. This model captured very precisely the full spectrum of rat perceptual choices we observed, supporting the hypothesis that auditory inputs induce an effective compression of the visual perceptual space. This suggests an important role for inhibition as the key mediator of auditory-visual interactions and provides clear, mechanistic hypotheses to be tested by future work on visual cortical codes.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78078?af=R">Incidence and Prevalence of Congenital Myopathies ‐ A Population‐Based Study From Western Sweden</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Congenital myopathies are a group of rare genetic muscle disorders. Previous studies have estimated point prevalences which only include surviving individuals. Our aim was to perform an epidemiological study with strict inclusion criteria, using modern diagnostic technology to present both incidences and prevalences, and to describe the genetic and muscle pathological characteristics of these disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective, population-based epidemiological study was conducted in western Sweden between 1985 and 2022. All patients diagnosed with congenital myopathies during this period were included.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 104 patients were identified whereas 25 died during the follow-up. The total birth prevalence (estimated lifetime risk) was 14.9 per 100,000 live births, whereas the total cumulative incidence by age 35 years was 12.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, and the total point prevalence was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The most common histopathological type was congenital myopathy with nonspecific changes (birth prevalence 4.1 per 100,000 live births), followed by core myopathy and centronuclear myopathy (2.1 per 100,000). The most common causative genes were <i>MYH2</i> (3.9 per 100,000) and <i>RYR1</i> (2.0 per 100,000). Despite using next-generation sequencing, 1 in 5 cases lacked a genetic diagnosis. Among those without a genetic cause, 4 of 5 had nonspecific histopathological changes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>By including all patients identified, both alive and deceased, our estimated incidence figures are considerably higher than estimates of point prevalence, which only includes living patients. As the mortality in these diseases is significant, incidence figures better reflect the occurrence in the population and are important for evidence-based health care planning and resource allocation.

                Background Non-performing loans (NPLs) critically threaten banking stability in developing economies. While robust board governance is a known mitigant, the mechanisms particularly the strategic role of interest rate policy set by the board remain underexplored. This study investigates whether interest rates mediate the relationship between board accountability and NPLs. Methods A sequential mixed-methods approach was employed. Data from 232 respondents in commercial banks in Western Uganda were collected via questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the mediation hypothesis. Results Board accountability showed a strong positive correlation with NPL reduction (r = 0.779, p < 0.05). Interest rates partially mediated this relationship (Beta = 0.286, t = 4.443, p = 0.000). Qualitative findings underscored the importance of flexible interest rate policies aligned with borrower risk profiles and economic conditions. Conclusion The study confirms that interest rates significantly mediate the effect of board accountability on NPLs. Enhanced governance frameworks and adaptive interest rate policies are critical for mitigating NPLs and promoting financial stability, particularly in developing economies.
