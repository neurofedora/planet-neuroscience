              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1426/v2?src=rss">Impact of sample size on optimisation algorithms for the MLP used in the prediction of client subscription to a term deposit [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21478">Differential Dynamic Causal Nets: Model Construction, Identification and Group Comparisons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21508">How 'Neural' is a Neural Foundation Model?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module.

                arXiv:2505.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a fundamental computational motif in neural circuits, supporting diverse cognitive functions through stable, self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. In these lecture notes, we review four key examples that demonstrate how autoassociative neural network models can elucidate the computational mechanisms underlying attractor-based information processing in biological neural systems performing cognitive functions. Drawing on empirical evidence, we explore hippocampal spatial representations, visual classification in the inferotemporal cortex, perceptual adaptation and priming, and working-memory biases shaped by sensory history. Across these domains, attractor network models reveal common computational principles and provide analytical insights into how experience shapes neural activity and behavior. Our synthesis underscores the value of attractor models as powerful tools for probing the neural basis of cognition and behavior.

                arXiv:2511.09506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems produce high-dimensional signals that lack macroscopic variables analogous to entropy, temperature, or free energy. This work introduces a thermoinformational formulation that derives entropy, internal energy, temperature, and Helmholtz free energy directly from empirical microstate distributions of arbitrary datasets. The approach provides a data-driven description of how a system reorganizes, exchanges information, and moves between stable and unstable states. Applied to dual-EEG recordings from mother-infant dyads performing the A-not-B task, the formulation captures increases in informational heat during switches and errors, and reveals that correct choices arise from more stable, low-temperature states. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup experiment, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Across both human and rodent systems, this thermoinformational formulation yields compact and physically interpretable macroscopic variables that generalize across species, modalities, and experimental paradigms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21768">Numerical Twin with Two Dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck Processes of Transient Oscillations in EEG signal</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.21768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with three interpretable parameters: decay rate, mean frequency, and noise amplitude. We develop two complementary estimation strategies. The first fits the power spectral density, amplitude distribution, and autocorrelation to recover OU-parameters. The second segments burst events and performs a statistical match between empirical spindle statistics (duration, amplitude, inter-event interval) and simulated OU output via grid search, resolving parameter degeneracies by including event counts. We extend the framework to multiple frequency bands and piecewise-stationary dynamics to track slow parameter drifts. Applied to electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia, the method identifies OU models that reproduce alpha-spindle (8-12 Hz) morphology and band-limited spectra with low residual error, enabling real-time tracking of state changes that are not apparent from band power alone. This decomposition yields a sparse, interpretable representation of transient oscillations and provides interpretable metrics for brain monitoring.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835">What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21407">BrainFuse: a unified infrastructure integrating realistic biological modeling and core AI methodology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20870">STAER: Temporal Aligned Rehearsal for Continual Spiking Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are inherently suited for continuous learning due to their event-driven temporal dynamics; however, their application to Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has been hindered by catastrophic forgetting and the temporal misalignment of spike patterns. In this work, we introduce Spiking Temporal Alignment with Experience Replay (STAER), a novel framework that explicitly preserves temporal structure to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. Our approach integrates a differentiable Soft-DTW alignment loss to maintain spike timing fidelity and employs a temporal expansion and contraction mechanism on output logits to enforce robust representation learning. Implemented on a deep ResNet19 spiking backbone, STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10. Empirical results demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms strong ANN baselines (ER, DER++) while preserving biologically plausible dynamics. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit temporal alignment is critical for representational stability, positioning STAER as a scalable solution for spike-native lifelong learning. Code is available at https://github.com/matteogianferrari/staer.

                arXiv:2601.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BioNIC, a multi-layer feedforward neural network for emotion classification, inspired by detailed synaptic connectivity graphs from the MICrONs dataset. At a structural level, we incorporate architectural constraints derived from a single cortical column of the mouse Primary Visual Cortex(V1): connectivity imposed via adjacency masks, laminar organization, and graded inhibition representing inhibitory neurons. At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013. Our findings demonstrate that integrating constraints derived from connectomics is a computationally plausible approach to developing biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems. This work also highlights the potential of new generation peta-scale connectomics data in advancing both neuroscience modeling and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20981">Diversifying Toxicity Search in Large Language Models Through Speciation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary prompt search is a practical black-box approach for red teaming large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often collapse onto a small family of high-performing prompts, limiting coverage of distinct failure modes. We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.

                arXiv:2601.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.

                arXiv:2601.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100\% accuracy across all decay factors $\beta\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $\sigma=0.2$ with >98\% gate-level accuracy.

                arXiv:2601.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.

                arXiv:2601.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

                arXiv:2601.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

                arXiv:2601.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.

                arXiv:2601.22075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.

                arXiv:2601.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21503">MAR: Efficient Large Language Models via Module-aware Architecture Refinement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

                arXiv:2601.21511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

                arXiv:2601.21557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

                arXiv:2601.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

                arXiv:2601.21945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

                arXiv:2502.03287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.

                arXiv:2601.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback-rich neural architectures can regenerate earlier representations and inject temporal context, making them a natural setting for strictly local synaptic plasticity. Existing literature raises doubt about whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback-Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning-relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. In this work, we introduce a compact prediction-reconstruction architecture with a dedicated feedback pathway providing lightweight, locally trainable temporal context for continual adaptation. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available. With a simple two-pair association task, learning is characterized through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row and column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A to B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association, while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under an alternating sequence, both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, alongside the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning. Together, the results show that a compact feedback pathway trained with local plasticity can support regeneration and continual-learning-relevant dynamics in a minimal, mechanistically transparent setting.

Abstract: Deployment complexity and specialized hardware requirements hinder the adoption of deep learning models in neuroimaging. We present MindGrab, a lightweight, fully convolutional model for volumetric skull stripping across all imaging modalities. MindGrab's architecture is designed from first principles using a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance (mean Dice score across datasets and modalities: 95.9 with SD 1.6), with up to 40-fold speedups and substantially lower memory demands compared to established methods. Its minimal footprint allows for fast, full-volume processing in resource-constrained environments, including direct in-browser execution. MindGrab is delivered via the BrainChop platform as both a simple command-line tool (pip install brainchop) and a zero-installation web application (brainchop.org). By removing traditional deployment barriers without sacrificing accuracy, MindGrab makes state-of-the-art neuroimaging analysis broadly accessible.

Abstract: The research community continues to seek increasingly more advanced synthetic data generators to reliably evaluate the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods. This work aims to increase the availability of datasets encompassing a diverse range of problem complexities by proposing a genetic algorithm that optimizes a set of problem complexity measures for classification and regression tasks towards specific targets. For classification, a set of 10 complexity measures was used, while for regression tasks, 4 measures demonstrating promising optimization capabilities were selected. Experiments confirmed that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty by transforming synthetically created datasets to achieve target complexity values through linear feature projections. Evaluations involving state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors revealed a correlation between the complexity of the generated data and the recognition quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability fail to describe how interpretability can be formally tested or designed for. We posit that actionable definitions of interpretability must be formulated in terms of *symmetries* that inform model design and lead to testable conditions. Under a probabilistic view, we hypothesise that four symmetries (inference equivariance, information invariance, concept-closure invariance, and structural invariance) suffice to (i) formalise interpretable models as a subclass of probabilistic models, (ii) yield a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion, and (iii) provide a formal framework to verify compliance with safety standards and regulations.

                One of the most difficult types of agrarian dispute to resolve in conflict-prone countries is one involving corporations, governments, and powerful individuals. Indonesia has the sixth highest agrarian conflict rate in Asia. This dispute took place in 74% of all occurrences, 94% of all individual victims, and 84% of all impacted households. This article focuses on territorial boundaries between indigenous tribes as well as Indonesian government programs such as public infrastructure development, which includes roads, bridges, airports, ports, and trains. This study combines historical analysis with current developments to contribute to an empirical and theoretical understanding of land battles. This article gives a systematic evaluation of the literature on indigenous peoples using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic evaluation and Meta-Analysis) methodology. This review looks at three academic databases: Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Eric. These findings reveal that many indigenous tribes continue to lack legal or official recognition. Despite constitutional law, Indonesia, a multicultural country, has customary and religious rules among its indigenous tribes. Recognition of customary law and customary land still lacks a solid foundation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-153/v1?src=rss">Empowerment Model for The Elderly and Community to Improve the Welfare of the Elderly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Rapid population ageing poses significant challenges to elderly welfare, particularly in communities with limited institutional support. This study aims to develop and empirically test an empowerment model involving older people and the community to sustainably improve elderly welfare. Using a mixed-method research design, the study combines quantitative analysis of welfare outcomes with qualitative exploration of empowerment processes. Quantitative data were collected through structured questionnaires administered to 210 elderly participants involved in community-based empowerment programs. Elderly welfare was measured across physical, psychological, social, and economic dimensions. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests, and multiple regression. Qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with elderly participants, family members, and community cadres. They were analysed thematically to enrich the interpretation of the statistical findings. The statistical results indicate a significant improvement in elderly welfare following program implementation. The mean welfare score increased from 3.12 to 3.89 on a five-point scale (t = 9.46, p < 0.001). Regression analysis shows that community participation (β = 0.41, p < 0.001) and elderly self-efficacy (β = 0.36, p < 0.01) are strong predictors of welfare improvement, explaining 52% of the variance in welfare outcomes (R2 = 0.52). Qualitative findings support these results, revealing enhanced independence, stronger social networks, and increased community recognition of older people as active contributors rather than dependents. The study concludes that an integrated empowerment model, combining health promotion, social engagement, economic micro-activities, and psychosocial support, effectively improves elderly welfare when supported by active community involvement. This research contributes to scientific discourse on empowerment-based ageing interventions and provides evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and practitioners in designing community-driven elderly welfare programs.

                Against the backdrop of the digital economy, government subsidies, as a key macroeconomic regulation tool, interact with enterprises’ digital marketing investment and consumer behavior, yet relevant in-depth research remains scarce. This study aims to explore the complex relationships between national subsidy policies, enterprises’ digital marketing strategies, and consumer purchase intentions, with a focus on the second-hand product market. Based on a review of existing literature, five core hypotheses are proposed: national subsidy policies significantly enhance enterprises’ digital marketing investment; enterprises’ digital marketing strategies under subsidies positively impact consumer purchase intentions; consumers’ awareness of subsidy policies strengthens their purchase intentions; consumers’ trust in digital marketing platforms moderates the impact of digital marketing on purchase intentions; and national subsidy policies reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase second-hand products. This research bridges the existing research gap, constructs a comprehensive theoretical framework for the interaction between government, enterprises, and consumers in the digital age, and provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for policy makers and business decision-makers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94576">Causal evidence for a domain-specific role of left superior frontal sulcus in human perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can flexibly choose their actions based on different information, ranging from objective states of the environment (e.g., apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialised or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general accounts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub-areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here, we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual- and value-based evidence, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision-making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for perceptual but not value-based decisions.

                <p>by Ruiwen Xu, Xiaoqing Cheng, Waiki Ching, Siyao Wu, Yuanben Zhang, Yidan Zhang</p>

The rational utilization of multimodal spatial transcriptomics (ST) data enables accurate identification of spatial domains, which is essential for investigating cellular structure and functions. In this study, we proposed SpaConTDS, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning. SpaConTDS generates positive and negative samples through data augmentation and a pseudo-label tuple perturbation strategy, enabling the learning of fused representations that capture global semantics and cross-modal interactions. The model’s hyper-parameters are dynamically optimized using reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across various resolutions and platforms demonstrate that SpaConTDS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in spatial domain identification and outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks such as denoising, trajectory inference, and UMAP visualization. Moreover, SpaConTDS effectively integrates multiple tissue sections and corrects batch effects without requiring prior alignment. Compared to existing approaches, SpaConTDS offers more robust fused representations of multimodal data, providing researchers with a flexible and powerful tool for a wide range of spatial transcriptomics analyses.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Green nanotechnology presents an opportunity in management of osteomyelitis, whereby environmental friendly procedures are used to provide nanoparticles that are of minimal toxicity. Green nanomaterials have the potential of effectively delivering antibiotics to the infected bone sites by incorporation of biocompatible materials to improve the efficiency of the delivery as well as reducing side effects. This sustainable treatment does not only provide safer treatment but also enhances faster healing and curbs infection spread that provides a more viable and environmentally friendly solution in managing osteomyelitis. This study is the first to synthesize poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles by using Phoenix dactylifera L. (Zahidi date) seeds extract as a capping agent in a green approach. 120 osteomyelitis specimens were collected; the nanoparticles were fabricated via a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation/diffusion technique followed by lyophilization. Characterization via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration of green-synthesized PLGA nanoparticles was determined. 40% of the specimens contained Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 20%, Staphylococcus aureus; 10%, Proteus mirabilis; 10%, Enterococcus faecium; and 20%, different Gram-negative bacilli. PLGA nanoparticles do not exhibit considerable crystallization using the date seed extract in XRD analysis, FTIR spectroscopic analysis of PLGA nanoparticles reveals absorption bands characteristic of the polymer’s chemical structure and indicates the presence of functional groups from both PLGA and the bioactive constituents of the date pit extract. (FE-SEM) confirmed the formation of uniformly sized spherical particles (23–33 nm) with an amorphous polymeric structure and maintaining the inherent chemical integrity of PLGA. Importantly, the incorporation of bioactive phytochemicals from the date seed extract was confirmed, indicating their participation in the functional activity of the nanoparticles. Antimicrobial activities determined using the broth microdilution method revealed high inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC: 75–125 μg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 100–125 μg/mL). The findings highlight the significance of incorporating agro-industrial waste into the sustainable production of bioactive nanocarriers. The developed PLGA nanoparticles constitute an efficient carrier system with high antibacterial activity and represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating osteomyelitis.

                Background Measles constitutes a substantial public health concern in Iraq. Despite concerted efforts to achieve elimination in accordance with World Health Organization targets, comprehensive understanding of its epidemiological patterns and vaccine effectiveness remains critically important. Objectives This investigation aimed to: (1) assess the relationship between age and clinical manifestations among measles patients; (2) evaluate Iraq’s progress toward measles elimination objectives; and (3) identify immunization coverage gaps. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 200 laboratory-confirmed measles cases (serological or molecular confirmation) from Ramadi Teaching Hospital, Al-Anbar Province, Iraq, during January 2023 to March 2024. Vaccination status was verified through official refrigerator immunization cards. Statistical analyses employed chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounding variables. Results Among 200 confirmed measles cases, 32% were infants aged <12 months and 68% were children aged 1-9 years. Notably, 71% represented breakthrough infections among individuals who had received at least one vaccine dose. Severe complications included pneumonia (77%), diarrhea (73%), otitis media (45%), and encephalitis (23%). Unvaccinated children demonstrated 3.2-fold increased odds of developing pneumonia. Disease burden was disproportionately higher in rural populations (58%). Mean C-reactive protein concentration was 56.8 mg/dL. Conclusion Measles persists with substantial morbidity in Iraq. The breakthrough infection rate (71%) significantly exceeds World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office reports (45-50%), suggesting unique regional challenges. Achieving elimination necessitates urgent evaluation of vaccination programs, strengthening of routine immunization services, and enhancement of surveillance systems. Future investigations should assess post-vaccination seroconversion rates and conduct molecular genotyping studies.

                This study presents a comprehensive three-level meta-analysis examining the relationship between creative play and creativity development, focusing on the moderating effects of age, culture, and game type. Using meta-analytic methods, we systematically analyzed 78 empirical studies (N = 21,456 participants) published between 2000 and 2024. Results revealed a significant positive relationship between creative play engagement and creativity development (g = 0.62, 95% CI [0.58, 0.66]). Moderator analyses showed the relationship’s strength varied significantly by age group: early childhood (3–7 years) demonstrated the strongest effect (g = 0.74), followed by middle childhood (8–12 years; g = 0.61), and adolescence (13–18 years; g = 0.84). Cultural context significantly moderated the relationship, with collectivist cultures showing a stronger effect (g = 0.68) compared to individualist cultures (g = 0.57). Regarding play type, dramatic play exhibited the strongest relationship with creativity (g = 0.71), followed by constructive play (g = 0.65), and digital play (g = 0.52). These findings underscore the importance of developmentally and culturally appropriate play interventions for fostering creativity. This research offers valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and future researchers in designing effective creativity-enhancing programs across developmental stages and cultural contexts.

                Background Cultural heritage tourism presents unique challenges and opportunities in building long-term consumer–brand relationships. While brand loyalty is a key objective for destination marketers, the role of authentic quality experience in shaping trust and perceived brand value remains underexplored. This study aims to bridge that gap by examining how quality experience influences brand trust, brand value, and ultimately brand loyalty, using a multidisciplinary lens that integrates marketing theory, cultural studies, and psychology. Methods A quantitative survey was conducted involving 573 respondents from diverse demographic backgrounds who had visited cultural heritage destinations. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the relationships among quality experience, brand trust, brand value, and brand loyalty. Measurement validity and reliability were assessed prior to hypothesis testing. Results The results indicate that quality experience has a significant positive effect on both brand trust and brand value. Furthermore, brand trust and brand value act as mediating variables that strengthen the relationship between quality experience and brand loyalty. The structural model demonstrated strong fit indices, confirming the robustness of the proposed relationships. These findings underscore the importance of delivering authentic and meaningful experiences to enhance consumer perceptions and emotional attachment to heritage brands. Conclusions This study advances the theory of Relationship Marketing and Tourism Consumption by clarifying the key role of quality experience in building brand loyalty. Practically, the findings offer concrete recommendations for heritage site managers and destination marketers to develop branding strategies that emphasize authenticity, emotional resonance, and sustainable engagement. By focusing on quality experience, heritage destinations can foster greater trust, perceived value, and loyalty among visitors.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly temporal resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

                Background In Peru, the legalization of Cannabis was given in 2017 and approved in 2019; however, there are discrepancies in the knowledge of the therapeutic use of this plant, causing rejection in its application as an alternative medicine. Methods The research was of a basic type with a quantitative approach and a non-experimental design, with a cross-sectional and descriptive scope. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied, with 324 participants aged 18-60. Data were collected through a virtual questionnaire of closed questions (KR-20 = 0.825). Descriptive statistics were used (frequencies and percentages), and inferential analyses Spearman’s correlation, simple linear regression, Monte Carlo exact tests, and a two-step cluster analysis to identify acceptance profiles. Results Participants expressed a favorable perception of the potential benefits of medical cannabis. However, their knowledge of its therapeutic indications and dosage was limited. Inferential analyses revealed a significant positive association between knowledge and acceptance of the therapeutic use of cannabis. Knowledge emerged as a significant predictor of acceptance, although it explained only a limited proportion of its variability. Cluster analysis identified distinct acceptance profiles within the study population, showing adequate internal cohesion and separation, and highlighting knowledge as the most influential factor in cluster formation. Despite moderate acceptance of regular use under medical supervision, participants emphasized that cannabis use should be limited to prescriptions from specialized physicians and supported by scientific evidence. Conclusion Study participants demonstrate limited knowledge about medical cannabis, despite moderate acceptance of its regulated use. Knowledge plays an important, though not exclusive, role in shaping acceptance, underscoring the need for targeted educational strategies and evidence-based public health policies.

                Abstract* Background The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is an open standard that is widely used for bioinformatics workflows. Due to its declarative nature WDL workflows can be easily presented and edited as graphs. Nextflow is both domain specific language for bioinformatics workflows and a convenient workflow execution engine. Our objective was to develop a tool that allows a user to edit WDL workflows visually as a graph providing synchronisation between its textual and graphical representation. Methods Translation of WDL workflows into Nextflow ones allows usage of both languages with the same execution engine. BioUML platform provides class library for object oriented presentation of most common workflow concepts as well as plugins for workflow visualisation and its graphical editing. Results We have developed a WDL parser that with some limitations maps content of WDL workflows into its object-oriented presentation (model). This model can be visualised and edited as a graph. WDL and Nextflow generators create WDL and Nextflow text from the same model. Conclusions Developed tools are available as a standalone Java program, web server, web service and a plugin for the BioUML platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-137/v1?src=rss">The Experimental Development of Solar Collector with Different Types of Nanofluid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In the present study, the flow rate and nanofluid effects on a parabolic trough solar collector were examined experimentally in Kirkuk city climate conditions during the period from May to July. Three flow rates, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 l/min were utilized. The theoretical and experimental results prove that lower flow rates enhance the thermal performance significantly as they increase the fluid residence time. According to the obtained results, two nanofluids, ZnO-water and MgO-water (at 0.2 wt. %), were experimentally evaluated at the optimal flow rate of 0.1 l/min. Both nanofluids showed better results than base fluid (water). Thus, MgO exhibited a better thermal efficiency of 66.9% at 12 pm than ZnO (62.7%) and water (57.19%). Directly, MgO generated the better thermal efficiency with maximum outlet temperature of MgO was 75.08°C. This could be due to the higher thermal efficiency of MgO-water, which is attributed to its much higher thermal conductivity (48.4 W/m·K) than ZnO (29 W/m·K). The exergy efficiency was nearly the same and negligible, that is, 13.8% for MgO, owing to the thermodynamic limitations. The practical results show that MgO nanofluid at a low flow rate could be an optimal solution for the parabolic trough solar collector.

                Background HFDs have adverse effects on metabolic health, which puts individuals at risk of obesity and liver and kidney dysfunction. Orlistat is an antihypertensive agent against obesity that prevents the absorption of dietary fats, although its impact on hepatic and renal functions is still disputed. In this study, the dose-dependent effects of orlistat on liver and renal functioning were in male rats on an HFD were assessed. Methods There was a control HFD group and three HFD groups with orlistat (360, 480 and 600 mg/kg) on male rats over 60 days. Lipid profiles, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP), kidney (urea, creatinine, direct and indirect bilirubin), and hematological (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC counts, MCV, MCH, MCHC) serum tests were done. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney tissues was done. Findings Orlistat caused dose-related changes in lipid profiles, increased liver enzymes, and an increased mark of kidney functioning. The hematological parameters were also greatly impaired, and the histopathology indicated structural and tissue damage in both of the organs, more so at higher doses. Conclusions Orlistat was used in HFD-conditions in male rats, which resulted in severe dose-related impairment of the liver and kidney. These results highlight the importance of close observation of hepatic and renal functions when using orlistat especially in the high-fat dietary situation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-135/v1?src=rss">Relation of Anxiety Levels and Objective Structured Clinical Examination among Undergraduate Nursing Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The incidence of stress and anxiety among nursing students is observed across all academic years of their educational training. Although Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are helpful in healthcare education, they can be anxiety-inducing. This study aimed to assess the anxiety level among nursing students during the OSCE exams. Methods A descriptive study was carried out on a purposive sample by distributing an online survey among students from an undergraduate nursing program. Anxiety levels were measured using the State-trait anxiety inventory, including the subscales of the state and trait of anxiety. Results A total of 121 students with a mean age of 22.2 years (SD +/-3.6) participated in the study. The majority of the participants, 72.7%, were females, and 27.3% were males. Before attending the OSCE, 58.7% of the participants reported a mild degree of anxiety, 33.1% had a moderate level of anxiety, and only 10.7% had a severe level of trait anxiety. Conclusions The findings highlight the complex interplay between sociodemographic factors, academic performance, work-study balance, and anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for high-stakes assessments like the OSCE. Addressing anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for OSCE assessments requires a multifaceted approach that considers individual characteristics, academic performance, and external stressors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-892/v2?src=rss">Why Are Christian Schools Popular in Japan Despite the Small Number of Christians? : A Case Study of a Catholic Girls’ Junior and Senior High School [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The proportion of Christians in Japan’s population is very small (0.7%). In contrast, Christian-affiliated schools are numerous and enjoy widespread popularity. As previous studies suggest, Christian schools—especially those for girls—are often associated with positive social images (such as being “refined” or “upper-class”), particularly among young women, and this association has been considered one reason for their popularity. However, much of the existing research is based on statistical analysis, literature review, or quantitative methods, and few studies have employed detailed qualitative approaches. Some earlier studies have applied Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of class reproduction to analyze the popularity of Christian girls’ schools, but they often frame this in terms of marriage as a pathway to upward social mobility—a perspective that does not fully align with the values of today’s youth, who tend to place greater emphasis on their individual careers. Therefore, this paper focuses on one Christian-affiliated integrated junior and senior high school for girls (referred to as School X) and explores the reasons for its popularity through semi-structured interviews with its alumni. Unlike previous research that has been constrained by gender biases, this study examines the appeal of such schools from the perspective of cultural capital. In particular, it emphasizes the relevance of alignment between the students’ values and the founding mission of the school. The findings reveal that the students perceived School X’s education as directly contributing to the acquisition of various forms of capital and habitus, as defined by Bourdieu (although not articulated in such terms by the students themselves). Additionally, These results indicate a strong sense of coherence between the school’s founding ideals and the students’ personal values. In conclusion, this paper offers insight—through the lens of cultural capital and habitus—into why Christian girls’ schools in Japan continue to be highly regarded.

                Background This study aimed to examine the knowledge, attitude, and perception of body donation among Phase-1 medical students at our institution. The objectives were to assist teachers in providing insight into the perception of this among students. Methods This was a cross-sectional, institution-based, time-bound study comprising 29 validated questions regarding comprehensive aspects of body donation. There were 396 medical students in Phase-1 from admissions for two consecutive years. Results Most students (94.4%) were aware of the source of cadavers in the dissection hall, which were either donated or unclaimed bodies from the hospital. However, 38.9% of them were unaware of the guidelines for body donation, and 79% were ignorant of the documents required to pledge. However, 84.3% were aware that it was mandatory to sign a pledge form. The time frame to procure the dead body to the department of anatomy of the institution was not known to 79% of the participants, and 93.2% of the participants opined that corpses from other neighboring states could be accepted. Opinions regarding the acceptance of donated bodies afflicted with long COVID were supported by 218 (55.1%), not supported by 47 (11.9%), and neutral by 131 (33.1%) participants in this study. Conclusion Specific knowledge gaps were encountered, including the timeframe, logistics, and legal issues in procuring the body. Since medical students play an important role in this societal motivation, it is suggested that a scientific session be planned in the curriculum of Phase-1 regarding the protocol of body donation. Apart from providing insights, this study also accomplishes the United Nations’ sustainable development goal-4 in offering quality medical education.

                Background Hydatid disease is a widespread disease that affects all human organs. Aims This study aimed to evaluate antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgM), complement proteins (C3 and C4), MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans. Methodology Hydatid cysts were collected from surgically injured patients at Fallujah Teaching Hospital, Twenty BALB/c mice were injected with Protoscolex antigen as treatment groups or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as control groups, at booster and challenge doses. Antibodies and complement concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of NBT, and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans were measured to assess cellular activity. Results The results showed significant differences in the levels of antibodies compared to the control group 21 days after injection of the protoscolex antigen at a concentration of 0.5 ml subcutaneously. There were also significant differences between the treatment and control group in the levels of C3 and C4. NBT dye reduction and phagocytosis of Candida albicans by PMNs showed significant differences compared to the control group. The results also showed a significant decrease in PMN viability in the treatment group. An increase in neutrophil migration diameter was observed. The results showed a 50.4% decrease in the infection level in the treatments injected with the antigen, and the average diameter of the hydatid cysts decreased compared with the control group. Conclusions The results indicate that Protoscolex antigen activates the immune response and reduces severity of hydatid disease. This highlights its potential as a promising candidate for developing a vaccine or preventive strategy against hydatid disease.

     alt="Distribution of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels and Scaffolding Proteins on Vestibular Calyx Ending Delineates the Axon Initial Segment"/>
<p>Various sodium channel isoforms and their scaffolding proteins are found in four different microdomains in vestibular calyx-bearing afferents. These microdomains serve different purposes, analogous to the heminode, axon initial segment, and synaptic domains of other types of sensory afferents.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amniote inner ear contains an unusual type of hair cell and a unique postsynaptic calyx terminal with specialized ion channel expression and afferent transmission mechanisms. The calyceal afferent terminal enwraps the hair cell and leads to a heminode. It has morphological and functional microdomains with distinct complements of potassium channels and scaffolding proteins. Stimulation of hair cells gives rise to postsynaptic potentials in the membrane facing the hair cell that propagate along the outer face of the calyx and parent axon to the heminode, giving rise to spikes with timing and response properties that vary with location (epithelial zone) and afferent morphology (calyx-only vs. dimorphic with additional bouton terminals). Heminodes of calyx-only afferents lie within the epithelium, placing the calyces themselves closer to the heminode. We report that diverse voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channel proteins (including Na<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.3, 1.5. 1.6, 1.8, and 1.9), HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channels, and associated scaffolding proteins (ankyrins, βIV-spectrin, and ezrin) are differentially deployed across calyx microdomains, and specific complements of proteins also vary with innervation zone in vestibular epithelia. Our results suggest the calyx outer surface plays a role analogous to an axon initial segment in central neurons, and that systematic variation in Na<sub>V</sub> pore-forming subunits underlies differences in firing properties of vestibular afferents in different epithelial zones.</p>

                Qu et al. identify HRD1 as a key negative regulator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. They demonstrate that HRD1 interacts with the SNARE protein SNAP29 to suppress its liquid-liquid phase separation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99438">Mitochondrial protein carboxyl-terminal alanine-threonine tailing promotes human glioblastoma growth by regulating mitochondrial function</a></h4>

              
                The rapid and sustained proliferation of cancer cells necessitates increased protein production, which, along with their disrupted metabolism, elevates the likelihood of translation errors. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The exogenous introduction of the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5α) protein, accompanied by artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and inhibited the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103550">Branched actin polymerization drives invasive protrusion formation to promote myoblast fusion during mouse skeletal muscle regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle regeneration is a multistep process involving the activation, proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells. Fusion of satellite cell-derived myoblasts (SCMs) is indispensable for generating the multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain incompletely understood. Here, we reveal a critical role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion during mouse skeletal muscle regeneration. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrate that branched actin polymerization is specifically required for SCM fusion but dispensable for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We show that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion and that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Together, our study identifies branched-actin regulators as key components of the myoblast fusion machinery and establishes invasive protrusion formation as a critical mechanism enabling myoblast fusion during skeletal muscle regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107037">Gut microbe-derived trimethylamine shapes circadian rhythms through the host receptor TAAR5</a></h4>

              
                Elevated levels of the gut microbe-derived metabolite trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO) are associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. However, the mechanism(s) linking TMAO production to human disease are incompletely understood. Initiation of the metaorganismal TMAO pathway begins when dietary choline and related metabolites are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by gut bacteria. Gut microbe-derived TMA can then be further oxidized by host flavin-containing monooxygenases to generate TMAO. Previously, we showed that drugs lowering both TMA and TMAO protect mice against obesity via rewiring of host circadian rhythms (Schugar et al., 2022). Although most mechanistic studies in the literature have focused on the metabolic end product TMAO, here we have instead tested whether the primary metabolite TMA alters host metabolic homeostasis and circadian rhythms via trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5). Remarkably, mice lacking the host TMA receptor (<i>Taar5<sup>−/</sup></i><sup>−</sup>) have altered circadian rhythms in gene expression, metabolic hormones, gut microbiome composition, and diverse behaviors. Also, mice genetically lacking bacterial TMA production or host TMA oxidation have altered circadian rhythms. These results provide new insights into diet–microbe–host interactions relevant to cardiometabolic disease and implicate gut bacterial production of TMA and the host receptor that senses TMA (TAAR5) in the physiologic regulation of circadian rhythms in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102539">Human brain dynamics and spatiotemporal trajectories during threat processing</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI (fMRI) research has traditionally investigated task processing using static blocked or event-related designs. Consequently, our understanding of threat processing remains limited to findings from paradigms with restricted dynamics. In this paper, we applied switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs) to uncover the dynamics of threat processing during a continuous threat-of-shock paradigm. Unlike typical systems neuroscience studies that assume systems are decoupled from external inputs, we characterized both endogenous and exogenous contributions to the dynamics. We first demonstrated that the SLDS model learned the regularities of the experimental paradigm; states and state transitions estimated from fMRI data across 85 regions of interest reflected both threat proximity and direction (approach vs. retreat). After establishing that the model captured key properties of threat-related processing, we characterized the dynamics of states and their transitions. The results reveal how threat processing can be viewed as dynamic multivariate patterns whose trajectories are determined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that jointly drive how the brain temporally evolves. Furthermore, we developed a measure of region importance to quantify individual brain region contributions to system dynamics, complementing the system-level SLDS formalism. Finally, we demonstrated that an SLDS model trained on one paradigm successfully generalizes to a separate experiment, capturing fMRI dynamics across distinct threat-processing tasks. We propose that viewing threat processing through the lens of dynamical systems offers vital avenues to uncover properties of threat dynamics not unveiled by standard experimental designs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107189">Accelerated evolution in networked metapopulations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h4>

              
                Natural populations are often spatially structured, meaning they exist as metapopulations composed of subpopulations connected by migration. Little is known about the impact of spatial structure, in particular the topology of connections among subpopulations, on adaptive evolution. Typically, spatial structure slows adaptation, although some models suggest topologies that concentrate dispersing individuals through a central hub can accelerate adaptation above that of a well-mixed system. We provide evidence to support this claim and show acceleration is accompanied by high rates of parallel evolution. Our results suggest metapopulation topology can be a potent force driving evolutionary dynamics and patterns of genomic repeatability in structured landscapes such as those involving the spread of pathogens or invasive species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106380">Single-cell transcriptomics identifies altered neutrophil dynamics and accentuated T-cell cytotoxicity in tobacco-flavored e-cigarette-exposed mouse lungs</a></h4>

              
                Despite the growing public health threat of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), the cell-specific immune responses to differently flavored e-cig exposure remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we characterized the lung immune landscape following acute nose-only exposure to flavored e-cig aerosols in vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) in mice. Metal analysis of daily generated aerosols revealed flavor-dependent, day-to-day variation in metal (Ni, Cu, K, and Zn) leaching. scRNA seq profiling of 71,725 lung cells from control and exposed mice revealed pronounced dysregulation of myeloid cell function in menthol (324 differentially expressed genes, DEGs) and tobacco (553 DEGs) flavors, and lymphoid cell dysregulation in fruit-flavor (112 DEGs) e-cig aerosol exposed mouse lung, compared to air controls. Flow cytometry corroborated these findings, showing increased neutrophil frequencies and reduced eosinophil counts in menthol- and tobacco-exposed lungs. Flavored e-cig exposure also increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proportions, upregulated inflammatory gene expression (<i>Stat4</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il1bos</i>, <i>Il1ra</i>, and <i>Cxcl3</i>), and enriched terms like ‘Th1 cytokine signaling’ and ‘NK cell degranulation’. Notably, tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol exposure increased immature (Ly6G⁻) neutrophils and reduced S100A8 expression, suggesting altered neutrophil activation in vivo. Overall, this study identifies flavor-dependent immune alterations in the lung following acute e-cig aerosol exposure and provides a foundation for future mechanistic studies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99003">Feeding rates in sessile versus motile ciliates are hydrodynamically equivalent</a></h4>

              
                Motility endows microorganisms with the ability to swim to nutrient-rich environments, but many species are sessile. Existing hydrodynamic arguments in support of either strategy, to swim or to attach and generate feeding currents, are often built on a limited set of experimental or modeling assumptions. Here, to assess the hydrodynamics of these ‘swim’ or ‘stay’ strategies, we propose a comprehensive methodology that combines mechanistic modeling with a survey of published shape and flow data in ciliates. Model predictions and empirical observations show small variations in feeding rates in favor of either motile or sessile cells. Case-specific variations notwithstanding, our overarching analysis shows that flow physics imposes no constraint on the feeding rates that are achievable by the swimming versus sessile strategies – they can both be equally competitive in transporting nutrients and wastes to and from the cell surface within flow regimes typically experienced by ciliates. Our findings help resolve a long-standing dilemma of which strategy is hydrodynamically optimal and explain patterns occurring in natural communities that alternate between free swimming and temporary attachments. Importantly, our findings indicate that the evolutionary pressures that shaped these strategies acted in concert with, not against, flow physics.

">Resting-state functional connectivity after creativity training with music composing</a></h4>

              
                Creativity is one of the unique cognitive constructs in human beings and its neurobiological correlates are one of the current hot topics in neuroscience. The Different Hearing program (DHP) is an educational activity aimed at stimulating musical creativity by means of group composing in the classroom, alternative to the mainstream model of music education in Czechia. In our previous study, the data from task-related functional MRI with passive listening was analyzed. The results suggested that DHP training modified the response to diverse sound samples, differentially changing the engagement of functional networks known to be related to creative thinking, namely, increasing default mode network activation and decreasing activation of executive and salience networks. In the present study, we hypothesized that the DHP short-term (2 days) intense workshop would also induce changes in the resting-state networks that were significantly modified during task. To investigate it, seed-based, ROI-to-ROI resting-state functional connectivity and degree centrality analysis were performed on the acquired resting-state fMRI data. The results showed no significant group-by-time interaction.

">Microstructural Disruption of the Forceps Minor in Schizophrenia: A Potential Clinical Imaging Biomarker Using Translational DTI</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is one of the most complex brain disorders, arising from multidimensional pathophysiological processes that span genetic vulnerability, neurotransmitter dysregulation, structural brain damage, and large-scale brain network dysfunction. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated the critical role of frontal brain regions in schizophrenia. Despite substantial progress, the precise localization of structural damage within these regions and the neurobiological mechanisms linking such alterations to disease pathology remain poorly understood. In this study, we included a total of 115 subjects from two sites of the B-SNIP dataset, comprising 60 healthy controls and 55 individuals with schizophrenia. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to precisely characterize specific structural alterations in the frontal brain regions associated with schizophrenia. Our findings reveal significant microstructural abnormalities in the forceps minor, a major commissural white-matter tract that serves as a critical interhemispheric bridge between the bilateral frontal lobes. Network-level mapping further demonstrates that the forceps minor is closely integrated with large-scale brain networks, particularly the default mode network, and maintains strong structural connectivity with orbitofrontal regions-both of which are known to exhibit dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, converging evidence suggests that the forceps minor plays an important role in the regulation of social behavior, a core domain of impairment in schizophrenia. Collectively, these findings identify the forceps minor as a promising structural imaging biomarker for schizophrenia and provide novel insights into the microstructural mechanisms underlying the disorder.

">Dissociation of Striosome and Matrix Activation in the Human Striatum During the Cue and Execution Phases of Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                The striatum comprises two neurochemically and anatomically distinct tissue compartments, the striosome and matrix, that are hypothesized to support different aspects of cognition and action. In animal studies, the striosome has been linked to reward evaluation, emotional learning, and decision-making under conflict, whereas the matrix is more closely associated with sensorimotor integration and task execution. However, evidence for compartment-specific function in humans is limited and indirect. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like patterns of structural connectivity in healthy adults. We then examined how these compartment-like voxels responded to task demands during an fMRI n-back working-memory paradigm that visually presented four stimulus categories (body part, face, place, or tool). We assessed activation in a low-load condition (0-back, remembering a just-viewed stimulus) vs. a high-load condition (2-back, remembering a stimulus viewed two prior). Functional activation was temporally segregated and matched our prior findings in motor tasks: striosome-like voxels were preferentially engaged during the cue and initial preparation phases, whereas matrix-like voxels dominated during task execution. Trial accuracy strongly modulated striatal activation, with both compartments showing significantly greater responses during "correct" than in "error" trials. Notably, the accuracy-related increase in activation was larger in striosome-like voxels, consistent with a prominent role for striosomal processing in performance evaluation. Both striosome- and matrix-like voxels significantly increased activation from 0-back to 2-back, indicating sensitivity to working-memory load, with larger increases for matrix-like than for striosome-like voxels. Category-selective responses also differed by compartment and cognitive load. Under low working-memory load (0-back), stimulus-category effects were modest and broadly similar between compartments. Under higher load (2-back), activation in striosome-like voxels remained selective for specific stimulus categories, while matrix-like voxels lost category specificity. Together, these findings suggest that the striosome-matrix distinction generalizes from motor to cognitive domains, reflecting a conserved division between preparatory and execution-related processes that varies systematically with task demands, memory category, and performance accuracy. This convergence of compartment-specific responses across domains points to a core organizational principle of the human striatum with potential implications for neuropsychiatric diseases.

                Schizophrenia is associated with profound working memory deficits, for which there are no approved treatments. Rare heterozygous null mutations in SETD1A, a gene encoding a key epigenetic regulatory protein, have been definitively linked to increased risk for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. To investigate how SETD1A haploinsufficiency impacts the function of circuits supporting working memory, this study examined neural oscillatory synchrony across a network of brain regions critical for spatial working memory (SWM) in mice carrying a loss-of-function allele in the orthologous SETD1A gene. Local field potential recordings were performed in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and thalamic nucleus reuniens in male and female wildtype and Setd1a+/- mice performing a delayed non-match to sample task of SWM. Setd1a+/- mice exhibited unaltered prefrontal-hippocampal neural oscillatory synchrony across frequencies and task epochs. In contrast, Setd1a+/- mice displayed reduced beta-frequency synchrony between the prefrontal cortex and nucleus reuniens during SWM maintenance and blunted bidirectional modulation of prefrontal-reuniens beta- and gamma-frequency synchrony across SWM task epochs. Collectively, this work expands our understanding of how genetic risk for schizophrenia alters functional connectivity within distributed circuits supporting SWM.

">Push-and-pull protein dynamics leads to log-normal synaptic sizes and probabilistic multi-spine plasticity</a></h4>

              
                A typical neuron receives thousands of inputs and is able to adapt the strength of its synapses to store new information and meet ongoing computational demands. The synaptic response to plasticity induction is stochastic and spatially structured but is traditionally described by deterministic models representing the enquote{average} dynamics. Growing experimental evidence indicates that not only the stimulation protocol determines the plasticity outcome but that the initial synaptic sizes, their fluctuations, and the spatial competition for the plasticity-relevant proteins play a decisive role. This probabilistic perspective makes it hard to predict the fate of a given synapse and requires a conceptual shift from a single synapse view to a probabilistic multi-spine competitive process where the plasticity needs and the available resources are considered together. Here, we propose a data-driven modeling framework able to predict collective plasticity outcomes along a dendrite based on the initial size, the number, and the spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated synapses. Our data analysis reveals a log-normal distribution of protein numbers for many plasticity-mediating proteins and shows that this log-normal protein allocation constrains and controls the collective plasticity outcome across multiple stimulated and non-stimulated synapses while preserving a global size distribution. Our findings highlight how local stochastic processes and global protein allocation rules give rise to synaptic plasticity outcomes, offering a new framework to understand and predict dendritic computation.

">A Detailed Model for Understanding the Human Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex underlies cognitive abilities that set humans apart from other species. Although Ramon y Cajal initiated its study in the 19th century, much about its fundamental properties remain poorly understood. Biologically detail modeling, has been shown to serve as a tool to understand the modeled system better. By comparing computational models for different species we can highlight functional differences between them, find their anatomical or physiological basis and thus improve our understanding of cortical function. In this study we built a detailed model of a human cortical microcircuit following an established workflow. We compared the human data and results against a previously published reconstruction of rat cortical circuitry. To parametrize the human model, we gathered new original data on human morphological reconstructions, axonal bouton densities, single cell and synaptic recordings. We combined them with data available in the literature and open-sourced databases. We also developed various strategies to overcome the missing data, such as generalizing or adapt- ing data from rodents. The resulting model consists of seven columnar units with similar characteristics. Each column has a radius of 476 um, a height of 2622 um, a volume of 1.86 mm3, a total cell density of 24,186 cells/mm3, on the order of 35,000 cells, around 12 million connections and approximately 47 million synapses. Comparing the rat and the human model showed that the human cortex is less dense in terms of cell bodies than the rodent cortex. Human cells have more complex branching, but lower bouton densities than rodent cells. However, the number of connections between cell types is similar.

">A functional influence based circuit motif that constrains the set of plausible algorithms of cortical function</a></h4>

              
                There are several plausible algorithms for cortical function that are specific enough to make testable predictions of the interactions between functionally identified cell types. Many of these algorithms are based on some variant of predictive processing. Here we set out to experimentally distinguish between two such predictive processing variants. A central point of variability between them lies in the proposed vertical communication between layer 2/3 and layer 5, which stems from the diverging assumptions about the computational role of layer 5. One assumes a hierarchically organized architecture and proposes that, within a given node of the network, layer 5 conveys unexplained bottom-up input to prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. The other proposes a non-hierarchical architecture in which internal representation neurons of layer 5 provide predictions for the local prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. We show that the functional influence of layer 2/3 cell types on layer 5 is incompatible with the hierarchical variant, while the functional influence of layer 5 cell types on prediction error neurons of layer 2/3 is incompatible with the non-hierarchical variant. Given these data, we can constrain the space of plausible algorithms of cortical function. We propose a model for cortical function based on a combination of a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and predictive processing that makes experimentally testable predictions.

">Reward-driven emergence of auditory pattern encoding in the primate motor system</a></h4>

              
                The ability to anticipate rhythmic patterns is fundamental to human experience, enabling music appreciation, speech comprehension, and dancing in sync to music. How the brain learns to use acoustic information to guide motor behavior remains a key question whose neural underpinnings and evolutionary origins are debated, especially in non-human primates. To understand how brain areas involved in motor control naively respond to predictable tone patterns, we recorded large single neuron populations across primary somatosensory (S1), primary motor (M1), dorsal premotor (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), pre-supplementary motor (preSMA) cortices, globus pallidus interna (GPi), and medial geniculate body (MGB) of a rhesus monkey. During passive listening (Experiment 1) with a reward only at the end of each trial, primarily the MGB, not motor areas, responded to the auditory tone patterns, ruling out the spontaneous entrainment of motor activity to auditory patterns. Almost all areas robustly represented the elapsed time within the trial, suggesting a general tracking of trial progression and reward structure. Next, we tested if motor areas learn to respond to auditory patterns if associated with rewards. When each tone was simultaneously accompanied by a liquid reward (Experiment 2), all areas except S1 showed clear responses to the tone patterns. To test if the tone responses persisted, the reward contingency was subsequently removed (Experiment 3). Strikingly, although the reward was delivered only at the trial's end as in Experiment 1, GPi neurons continued to track the occurrence of the tones. These findings suggest that while basic sensory processing of tone patterns occurs in the MGB, higher-order processing in motor areas is profoundly shaped by reward association. This reorganisation of neural responsiveness shows that the capacity for auditory association can be elicited in the motor system through appropriate motivational contexts.

">A Dual-Pathway Prediction Error Model of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders:Bridging NMDA Hypofunction and Dopaminergic Hyperfunction</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) present a profound clinical enigma, manifesting as a heterogeneous continuum ranging from the chaotic volatility of acute psychosis to the impenetrable rigidity of systematized delusions. While neurobiological research has independently implicated NMDA receptor hypofunction or dopaminergic hyperfunction as cardinal pathophysiological distinct mechanisms, a computational framework capable of bridging these distinct cellular deficits to the spectrum's vast phenomenological diversity remains elusive. Here, we propose a biologically plausible neural model using a dynamic Bayesian inference with separable positive and negative prediction-error pathways. We demonstrate that NMDA hypofunction selectively blunts negative prediction errors, fostering rigid, bias-dominated beliefs, while dopaminergic hyperfunction uniformly amplifies error signals, driving volatile, observation-dominated states. Their interaction reconstructs SSDs as a continuous bias-volatility spectrum, accounting for key neurophysiological markers and offering a theoretical foundation for mechanism-based patient stratification.

">The activation of CT fibers or affective touch does not affect pain sensitization by secondary hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal affective touch, that preferentially engages C-tactile (CT) afferents, has been shown to produce analgesic effects, yet its role in pain sensitization remains poorly understood. This study explores whether touch delivered at CT-optimal parameters, either artificial or interpersonal, modulates secondary hyperalgesia (SH) induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, 46 participants underwent SH induction during two conditions: robot stroking at CT-optimal velocities and vibrotactile stimulation. In Study 2, 64 participants (32 couples) experienced SH in two separate sessions: alone or accompanied by their partner delivering affective touch. Pain reports, electroencephalographic activity (N-P complex and time-frequency activity), electrocardiographic (ECG) and electrodermal activity data (EDA) were collected. HFS successfully established SH in both studies; however, no significant differences were found in the SH area between CT-stimulation and control conditions. In Study 2, partner-delivered affective touch significantly reduced reported acute pain during HFS compared to the alone condition, whereas no such effect was observed in Study 1 (robotic vs. vibrotactile). At the neural level, no condition effects were observed in the N-P complex, EEG time-frequency data and ECG indexes in either study. Tonic EDA after HFS was higher when participants received stroking from their romantic partner compared to being alone. No sex differences were observed. Overall, while affective touch from a romantic partner may reduce acute pain during nociceptive stimulation -an effect not observed with robotic CT-stimulation- neither robotic nor interpersonal affective touch appeared to modulate the development of secondary hyperalgesia.

">Prior Scene Context Shapes the Neural Dynamics of Face Detection</a></h4>

              
                Detecting faces in our surroundings typically only takes a fraction of a second. How can such a rapid perceptual process still be influenced by prior expectations? Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how prior scene context modulates the temporal dynamics of neural face representations. Participants viewed natural scenes containing a single face (left or right), each preceded by either a faceless version of the same scene (preview condition) or a gray screen (no-preview condition), while performing a face detection task. Using multivariate decoding, we found that face location could be decoded shortly after target onset. Critically, decoding accuracy was higher in the preview condition at early stages, whereas the no-preview condition showed higher decoding at later time points, suggesting rapid facilitation by prior context followed by compensatory processing when contextual information was absent. In contrast, time-frequency decoding revealed a sustained preview advantage across alpha, beta, and gamma bands, even during time periods when evoked responses favored the no-preview condition. This dissociation between evoked and induced neural signals indicates that prior scene context engages distinct neural processes: early evoked activity reflects rapid contextual facilitation of sensory representations, while induced oscillatory activity may support prolonged context-dependent modulation. Together, these results show how prior scene context and sensory-driven processing jointly shape rapid face perception through temporally and spectrally distinct neural dynamics.

">Optimizing Network-Level TMS-fMRI: Benchmarking a Novel TMS-Compatible "Sushi" MR Coil</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Concurrent TMS-fMRI allows to observe how stimulation affects the target region and connected brain-wide networks. However, hardware limitations represent a major constraint: standard MR head coils provide high imaging sensitivity but no room for the TMS coil, whereas available TMS-compatible MR head coils offer access but low or strongly inhomogeneous signal. Methods: We developed and benchmarked a flexible "Sushi" MR-receive setup, assembled from two repurposed 18-channel body arrays, that allows TMS coil positioning while maintaining full-brain coverage. Resting-state (n = 12) and task-based working memory (n = 8) fMRI were acquired with the Sushi coil, a commercially available 2x7-channel Surface-coil setup, and a standard Siemens 64-channel (non-TMS-capable) head coil. The image-quality cost of TMS capability was addressed by acquiring multi-echo fMRI to allow post-hoc optimization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but no TMS was delivered. Results: From resting-state fMRI, the Sushi mapped known canonical resting-state networks (RSNs) comparably to the 64-channel reference and was superior to the Surface coils, in particular for the default-mode, auditory, and visual networks. Task-fMRI data showed that Sushi recovered the working memory network more similarly to the 64-channel reference than the Surface coil. Temporal SNR was optimized for all coil acquisitions yielding ~30-50% gain and improving between-coil comparability for RSNs identification and task-related activity. Conclusions: Together, post-hoc multi-echo optimization and the Sushi coil setup provide a low-cost, ready-to-use solution for whole-brain concurrent TMS-fMRI recordings. Combining stimulation access with reliable functional network readouts is essential to probe mechanisms of TMS and to inform effective TMS interventions targeting altered brain systems.

">Cellular mechanisms underlying social regulation of the posterior tubercular nucleus in zebrafish (Danio rerio)</a></h4>

              
                Social status profoundly influences animal behavior through neural plasticity, yet the cellular mechanisms that mediate reconfiguration of neuromodulatory systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated status-dependent structural changes in the posterior tubercular nucleus (PTN) of adult zebrafish. Animals were assigned to four social conditions: communal, isolated, dominant, or subordinate. Using markers for cell proliferation (PCNA) and birth-dating (BrdU), we demonstrate that social dominance significantly enhances neurogenesis, leading to an increased population of PTN dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, subordinate and isolated fish exhibited suppressed neurogenesis and elevated expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), suggesting that chronic social stress induces an oxidative burden that may lead to neuronal loss. Furthermore, we identified evidence of neurotransmitter phenotypic plasticity; subordinate fish displayed a significantly higher ratio of glutamatergic (vglut2a) to dopaminergic (dat) expression in PTN neurons compared to dominants, suggesting a status-dependent shift in neuromodulatory identity. Multivariate principal component analysis further revealed distinct neurobiological profiles that separate social ranks, suggesting that status-dependent plasticity is a coordinated multi-modal response. Collectively, our results improve our understanding of how social experience reshapes the zebrafish brain through integrated changes in cell proliferation, cellular shift in cellular identity and regulation of cellular viability; thus, providing a potential mechanism for the maintenance of stable behavioral phenotypes in competitive social environments.

">Progressive bilateral recruitment and resilient network reorganization during temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often originates from focal hippocampal injury but progressively evolves into a bilateral epileptic network engaging both hippocampi and distributed cortical regions. A mechanistic understanding of how this network emerges, and whether early perturbation of specific nodes can alter its trajectory, is essential for developing network-level therapeutic strategies. Objective: We used a kainate-induced rodent model of TLE to (1) characterize the spatiotemporal emergence of epileptic discharges during the latent phase, (2) determine how bilaterally synchronized events develop, and (3) test whether transient chemogenetic silencing of either the ipsilateral epileptogenic focus (EF) or the contralateral hippocampus (CH) modifies large-scale epileptogenesis. Methods: Freely moving mice were implanted with multisite electrodes spanning bilateral hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1, subiculum) and cortical regions (M2, Cg1, PrL, V1, entorhinal cortex). Longitudinal LFP recordings were performed every other day during the latent and early chronic phases following KA or saline injection. DREADD-based chemogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic neurons was applied between days 2-7 post-KA. Epileptiform events were quantified via spike rates, waveform metrics, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and short-latency interregional co-spiking. Results: Early after KA, epileptic spiking emerged locally in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and progressively organized into HFO-coupled discharges. Contralateral hippocampal recruitment followed a distinctive biphasic time course, characterized by transient early activation, subsequent suppression, and later re-emergence with increasing bilateral coactivation. Cortical regions gradually developed higher spike rates and enhanced DG-related co-spiking, indicating large-scale network integration. Ipsilateral silencing modified local spike composition but did not prevent global network progression, whereas contralateral silencing accelerated ipsilateral epileptogenesis and strengthened pathological HFO expression. Conclusion: Epileptogenesis in the KA model reflects a transition from a focal hippocampal insult to a resilient, bilateral cortico-hippocampal network. Targeting a single hippocampal node, even at early latent stage, is insufficient to halt this progression, highlighting the need for network-level therapeutic strategies.

                Micrographia, characterized by abnormally small handwriting, is a common motor symptom in Parkinson's disease, and has been classified into consistent micrographia (CM) and progressive micrographia (PM), which may reflect different underlying mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of motor execution and sensorimotor processing to these subtypes remain unclear. In this study, forty-five people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and twenty age-matched healthy controls (HCs) completed a handwriting task and a control detection task (CDT) assessing the ability to distinguish self-generated from externally generated movements. PwP were classified based on handwriting metrics as showing no micrographia, CM, and/or PM. CDT accuracy was significantly lower in PwP than in HCs (p < 0.01) and was particularly reduced in PwP with PM (p < 0.01). These findings indicate that PM is associated with impaired motor awareness, suggesting altered sensorimotor integration as a characteristic feature of this subtype.

">Cross-Category Invariant Neurons in the Human Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing individuals or objects across different contexts is a hallmark of primate cognition. Beyond recognition, the brain organizes visual stimuli into meaningful categories, supporting efficient perception and adaptive behavior. Previous studies in the human temporal lobe have identified concept cells supporting invariant representations of specific stimuli. However, invariant coding alone cannot account for how categorical knowledge is structured across related visual domains. Here, we analyzed single-neuron recordings from the human amygdala during the presentation of familiar visual stimuli spanning multiple categories. Using a novel data-driven analytic framework that integrates supervised population decoding with single-neuron analyses, we identified a population of cross-category invariant neurons. These neurons preserved exemplar-invariant responses while generalizing across multiple categories linked by shared naturalistic or human/domestic contexts. Our findings demonstrate that the human amygdala supports both invariant and associative forms of categorical representations. By linking stable identity representations across contextually related categories, the amygdala provides a flexible neural substrate for high-level visual organization, supporting efficient perception and adaptive behavior in complex environments.

">A HaloTag-4R-Tau Pulse-Chase Sensor Reveals Neddylation Inhibition Promotes Degradation of Tau in iNeurons</a></h4>

              
                Tau accumulation is a central driver of neurodegenerative diseases, yet strategies to promote its clearance remain limited. We developed a HaloTag-4R-Tau sensor in human iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons) that enables sensitive monitoring the kinetics of both lysosomal partitioning and overall cellular turnover of tau. Using this sensor, we screened a small collection of small-molecule modulators of proteostasis network function and identified Neddylation inhibition by Pevonedistat as a robust promoter of soluble tau degradation. Mechanistic analysis including proteomic profiling revealed that Neddylation inhibition hastens HaloTag-Tau clearance via compensatory activation of a proteasome-dependent pathway(s) as well as the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Our findings establish a powerful tool for probing tau homeostasis and highlight Neddylation inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for enhancing both proteasome and lysosome-mediated tau clearance in tauopathies.

">Metabolic Connectivity Gradients of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The functional architecture of the brain is organised along continuous, macro-scale gradients. However, it is unknown if the metabolic architecture of the brain displays similar gradient characteristics. Here, we use functional positron emission tomography (fPET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to characterise the metabolic connectivity gradients of the brain and determine how neurobiological mechanisms shape these gradients to support cognition across the adult lifespan. We identified four principal metabolic connectivity gradients, with the primary axis recapitulating the canonical unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy from other imaging modalities. Subsequent gradients delineated specialised dimensions of metabolic organisation, including association system differentiation, hemispheric asymmetry, and sensory system segregation. These gradients were coupled to cortical thickness, baseline rates of glucose metabolism, blood flow, and gene expression related to energy metabolism, such that transmodal, control and default mode poles were more metabolically active, more interconnected, had greater cortical thickness, and were more strongly related to the expression of genes related to cellular energy production, than unimodal and sensory poles. A reduction in gradient strength at the gradient poles was associated with older age and predicted worse cognitive performance. We conclude that the metabolic organisation of the brain constitutes a genetically grounded, structurally and energetically constrained gradient hierarchy that supports cognitive function and undergoes a reorganisation in ageing.

">Oscillatory traveling waves during visual entrainment in autistic and neurotypical adults</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations play a crucial role in cognition, and several studies emphasize the importance of considering them as traveling waves that propagate through brain regions. In scalp EEG, waves typically travel along the anterior posterior axis: forward waves (occipital to frontal) predominate during sensory stimulation, while backward waves (frontal-to-occipital) emerge during rest and top down modulation. Within the predictive coding framework, backward waves are proposed to convey predictive signals, whereas forward waves reflect sensory processes and feedforward propagation of prediction errors. In this study, we investigated traveling wave dynamics during a visual entrainment task in neurotypical (N=25) and autistic (Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD) adults (N=24). Our results replicated previous findings in neurotypical participants, as we observed an increase in backward waves during rhythmic visual stimulation, consistent with enhanced top-down predictions. Notably, we observed the opposite pattern in the ASD group, characterized by a pronounced increase in forward waves at the entrained frequency during visual stimulation. These results align with predictive coding accounts of autistic perception, which hypothesize an imbalance between predictions and sensory evidence. Specifically, an increase in forward wave may reflect a bias toward bottom up sensory signaling over predictive feedback, due to atypical hierarchical communication across brain regions in ASD. Together, our findings shed new light on the oscillatory dynamics involved in visual entrainment in neurotypical adults and provide novel evidence in favor of predictive coding accounts of autistic perception, as well as a consequent bias toward bottom up sensory signaling over predictive feedback in a context of visual entrainment.

">Light-inducible proximity labelling in vivo captures sex-specific RNA at excitatory synapses</a></h4>

              
                Local RNA regulation is essential for synaptic plasticity, yet the full repertoire of RNA species and associated isoforms within specific synaptic compartments in vivo has yet to be determined. Existing RNA profiling approaches lack the spatial and temporal precision needed to resolve RNA repertoires restricted to cell-type specific synaptic compartments. To overcome this challenge, we developed PSD95 Haloseq, a light induced proximity labelling technique that, when combined with long read sequencing, selectively captures all post-synaptic full length RNA species in the excitatory post synaptic compartment. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sex differences in RNA expression within excitatory synapses following exposure to an associative fear learning task in C57/Bl6 mice. We found dramatic sex differences in pseudogene and protein coding RNA expression, which are most abundant in females, with males exhibiting multiple noncoding RNA classes, including lncRNA, snoRNA, and rRNA. Females generally showed more 3' UTR expression, and there was widespread differential exon usage following fear conditioning, including 179 isoforms in males, 69 in females, with no significant gene level differential expression, indicating that behavioural state modifies sex specific isoform usage rather than overall transcript abundance. Our discovery that synaptic RNA composition is dynamic, sexually dimorphic, and profoundly shaped by experience, offers new insight into previously inaccessible mechanisms underlying sex differences in fear-related learning and memory. PSD95 Halo seq is therefore a powerful method for the precise spatiotemporal identification of compartment- and cell type specific RNA.

">Proactive visual and motor prioritization differentially scale with cue reliability</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues enable the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming behavior, such as by selectively prioritizing relevant visual representations and associated action plans in working memory in service of an imminent task. While it has been demonstrated that neural dynamics of visual and motor prioritization each scale with cue reliability, studies to date tracked either visual or motor prioritization in isolation. It therefore remains unknown whether visual and motor prioritization scale similarly or differently with cue reliability. To fill this gap, we manipulated cue reliability (100%, 80%, 60%) in a visual-motor working-memory task that uniquely enabled us to isolate the neural dynamics associated with visual and motor prioritization in anticipation of an imminent working-memory task. EEG measurements in male and female human volunteers revealed how cue reliability differentially drives visual and motor prioritization. While the strength and timing of visual prioritization were largely invariant to cue reliability, motor prioritization profoundly scaled with cue reliability and developed more gradually with lower certainty. These findings show that visual and motor prioritization in working memory are differentially susceptible to the certainty conveyed by environmental cues, and suggest that motor prioritization may be more cautious in nature.

">Machine learning-based image analysis of Parkinson's disease iPS-derived neurons predicts genotype and reveals mitochondria-lysosome abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction are central features of Parkinson's disease (PD) across major genetic forms including PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2. We applied cell morphomics, a machine-learning-based framework combining high-content imaging with quantitative feature extraction, to analyse mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology at single-cell resolution in iPS cell-derived cortical neurons from PD patients and healthy controls (13 lines total). Supervised machine-learning models distinguished PD neurons from controls with high accuracy (AUC = 0.87) and reliably separated individual genotypes. Feature importance and attribution analysis revealed genotype-specific organelle biases, with mitochondrial features dominating classification in PRKN neurons, balanced mitochondrial and lysosomal contributions in SNCA neurons, and a greater lysosomal contribution in LRRK2 neurons. Multi-class models retained strong performance, and findings were reproduced across two independent laboratories using different dyes and imaging conditions. These results demonstrate that morphomics provides a robust and scalable framework to quantify genotype-specific organelle abnormalities in PD neurons and supports its application for cellular stratification and biomarker discovery.

">Individual Dynamics in Stress-Related Pain Responses</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stress and pain are two adaptive mechanisms, driving human behavior and cognition. They are bidirectionally related, and modulating factors such as sleep or physical activity were identified. However, how stable individual differences in pain-related distress, including individual dispositions for pain catastrophizing, and person-specific pain sensitivities relate to the strength of stress responses remains unclear. This preregistered study closes this gap by investigating how trait pain-related distress and pain sensitivity changes relate to individuals stress response. Methods: Trait pain-related distress was assessed in 148 healthy males with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the Fear of Pain Questionnaire. Baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, alpha-amylase, and cortisol were obtained as well as initial heat pain thresholds and tolerances. One participant group underwent the Maastricht Acute Stress Task, while a control group performed the placebo version of this task, and consecutively all stress- and experimental pain indicators were examined again. Results: Individuals with lower kinesiophobia demonstrated higher stress-induced increases in alpha-amylase. Furthermore, stress-induced changes in pain sensitivity showed high individual variability, but were not associated with the stress response. Finally, in individuals with a higher tendency to catastrophize and to fear pain, stronger alpha-amylase increases were associated with larger post-stressor increases in pain threshold, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that stable individual differences influence the stress-pain link beyond physiology. This underscores the importance of considering trait differences in future research on stress-pain interactions with the goal of better tailoring preventions and treatments for patients with chronic pain.

">LSD Reconfigures Cortical Dynamics Through Faster Brain Rhythms and Increased Fractal Dimension</a></h4>

              
                Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alters conscious experience, yet the electrophysiological mechanisms by which it reshapes neural dynamics remain incompletely understood. A hallmark of psychedelic states is widespread cortical desynchronization, typically inferred from reductions in spectral power, but whether such effects reflect genuine weakening of neural oscillations or are confounded by shifts in oscillatory peak frequencies remains unresolved. Here, we address this gap by combining source-resolved magnetoencephalography (MEG), spectral parameterization, temporal complexity metrics, and interpretable machine learning in an LSD versus placebo design, with and without music. We show that LSD induces robust, spatially structured increases in alpha and beta peak frequencies alongside genuine attenuation of oscillatory power, with these effects displaying partly dissociable cortical patterns. Beyond rhythmic activity, LSD is associated with flattening of the aperiodic 1/f spectral slope and increased neural signal complexity and fractality, preferentially affecting sensory, language, emotion, and imagery-related networks while sparing motor cortex. Machine-learning analyses further identify peak-frequency shifts, aperiodic parameters, and complexity measures as key discriminators of the psychedelic state. Music does not robustly amplify these neural signatures and instead shows a trend toward attenuation. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive electrophysiological account of how LSD reorganizes large-scale human brain dynamics and highlight features that may differentiate its neural signature from that of other psychedelics.

">Divergent Electrophysiological Responses in the Human Hippocampus During Verbal Memory Processing</a></h4>

              
                The profile of electrophysiological responses in the human hippocampus (HPC) during verbal memory processing has remained complex and unclear. Here, we studied 26 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes across 187 HPC sites (50% left, 2-18 per patient). During memory encoding and retrieval, a subset of HPC responsive sites demonstrated increased ripple events, along with elevated high-frequency (HFA >50 Hz), and low-frequency (LFA 1-8 Hz) activity. A nearly equal number of sites showed no changes in ripple rate but increased LFA power and a delayed response-locked decrease in HFA power. More importantly, both successful encoding as well as recognition of remembered words were strongly associated with the coordination of the timing of LFA and HFA increases across the two clusters of responsive HPC sites. Using direct cortical electrical stimulations, we confirmed overlapping, but partially distinct, cortical connections to the functionally distinct HPC clusters. Our findings suggest a mesoscale mosaic functional organization within the human HPC where adjacent sites with divergent electrophysiological responses may have specialized roles during verbal memory processing. More importantly, our findings suggest that successful human memory depends on the coordination of the timing of low and high frequency local fields generated across these functionally divergent neuronal population sites.

">Diurnality reconfigures circadian network dynamics in the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Diurnal and nocturnal mammals occupy opposite temporal niches, but whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, follows the same intrinsic rules for timing adjustment and network coordination across species is unknown. Because SCN clock gene rhythms and population-level activity measurements look broadly similar across species, the prevailing interpretation in comparative studies has been that temporal niche differences are implemented upstream or downstream of the SCN. However, these coarse readouts do not test how clock resetting depends on circadian phase or how neuronal timing is coordinated across SCN space. Here, we combined long-duration ex vivo SCN recordings with optogenetic stimulation to compare SCN network dynamics in the nocturnal mouse (Mus musculus) and the diurnal four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). Rhabdomys SCN molecular clock rhythms exhibited a longer intrinsic period and, under the same daily stimulation protocol, converged on a larger absolute phase angle relative to the stimulus. Molecular clock phase response curves differed in overall structure across circadian time between species, including pronounced early subjective day delays in Rhabdomys when Mus responses were minimal. Phase mapping of single-cell SCN calcium rhythms revealed species-specific spatial timing organization, with a graded dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral phase progression in Rhabdomys and a sharper transition in Mus. The Mus and Rhabdomys SCN can thus appear similar by coarse readouts yet diverge in phase-dependent molecular clock resetting and network timing organization. These results indicate that models placing temporal niche divergence solely outside the SCN are mechanistically incomplete.

">Chondroitin 4-sulphate depletion enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in aging</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialised extracellular matrix structures enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are key regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Aging is characterised by a shift in chondroitin sulphate composition toward increased chondroitin-4-sulfation (C4S) and reduced C6S, a pattern associated with declining cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigated how selective reduction of C4S affects PNN structure, PV-interneuron connectivity, and cognitive performance across the lifespan. Conditional deletion of the C4-sulfotransferase Chst11 markedly reduced C4S levels and diminished dendritic PNN complexity while preserving somatic PNN structure. This partial destabilisation of PNNs increased excitatory synaptic input onto PV interneurons in both young and aged mice, without major alterations in basal hippocampal transmission or long-term potentiation. Behaviourally, Chst11 knockout mice showed robust and persistent protection against age-related cognitive decline. Working memory performance remained stable across aging, short-term spatial memory was enhanced from early adulthood onward, and object recognition memory was significantly prolonged at all retention delays, even in old age. Sociability and social novelty preference were also preserved longer in aging knockouts compared with controls. These improvements occurred despite an overall preservation of PNN architecture, indicating that modifying sulphation rather than removing CSPGs is sufficient to enhance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that reducing C4S through Chst11 deletion confers long-lasting enhancements in cognitive function and mitigates aging-related decline. Targeting CS-GAG sulphation patterns may therefore represent a promising strategy for maintaining cognitive resilience and restoring plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative conditions.

">Serum neurofilament light chain predicts stroke outcome and is a potential marker for treatment effects of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in a rat stroke model</a></h4>

              
                Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed beyond reperfusion therapy. Translating preclinical success to clinical impact has been hindered by variability in animal models and the lack of translational biomarkers that predict outcomes across species. To overcome these barriers, we developed a robust rat AIS model optimized for consistency and severity, enabling rigorous therapeutic testing. Additionally, we tested a panel of common clinical serum biomarkers to improve translation from rodents to humans. We demonstrated that serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) -a biomarker widely used in clinical stroke studies- strongly correlated with functional outcomes, establishing a translational link that has not been previously reported in rats. Notably, the predictive capability of NfL outperformed infarct volume, a key prognostic factor in moderate and severe strokes, as well as traditional serum biomarkers intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and S100 calcium binding protein (S100B). Using this platform, we evaluated the therapeutic impact of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC EVs), a novel biologic therapy poised for clinical trials, on stroke outcome in our rat AIS model. A three-dose regimen of NSC EV over 48 hours produced the best outcomes in stroked animals evidenced by smaller infarct volume, improved neurologic score, and reduced serum NfL, although single-dose and two-dose regimens were both effective at some endpoints. These findings not only validate NfL as a cross-species biomarker but also provide critical dosing insights for NSC EV therapy, accelerating the path from bench to bedside for AIS treatment.

">Altered theta distribution and coherence during set-shifting in older age</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility is an executive function that enables adapting behaviour to a changing environment and is thus critical for daily life. The degree of its preservation upon healthy aging and the neural mechanisms underlying it are still a matter of debate. To investigate the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive flexibility in older age, we measured cognitive flexibility in 99 young (24.75 {+/-} 4.45 years) and 83 older adults (69.19 {+/-} 6.25) using electroencephalography (EEG). Compared to young adults, older adults showed a more conservative response pattern with longer reaction times, but lower error rates (speed-accuracy tradeoff). In the EEG, both age groups exhibited increased theta-power during set-shifting, with a fronto-central peak in the young, but a more fronto-lateral topography in older adults. Importantly, both groups displayed increases in theta coherence and global efficiency during set-shifting, but coherence modulations were restricted in frontocentral areas in the young but were diminished and distributed across the scalp in the older. Better set-shifting performance was most strongly associated with high coherence and global efficiency irrespective of age group. These results point to an age-related change of cortical processing underlying cognitive flexibility which involves the employment of more distributed neural resources for successful task completion.

">Dynamical Aβ-Tau-Neurodegeneration Model Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Mechanisms and Biomarker Progression</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the pathological interaction of two proteins, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau, which collectively drive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers is captured by the ATN framework, which is a powerful tool for disease classification. However, since the ATN framework is mainly descriptive, it cannot quantify or predict relationships between biomarkers over time. We address this limitation by introducing a dynamical ATN (dATN) model that mechanistically simulates the spatiotemporal progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration. The dATN model integrates mechanisms of prion-like protein aggregation of A{beta} and tau, network-based tau propagation, A{beta}-driven catalysis of tau progression, and tau-driven neurodegeneration. We calibrated the model using multimodal longitudinal imaging data from both the ADNI and BioFINDER-2 cohorts and show that it accurately fits longitudinal regional A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration data. Using the dATN model, we show that A{beta}-induced effects predict Braak-like cortical tau progression, that the spatial colocalisation of A{beta} and tau is a crucial biomarker of disease acceleration, and that tau-driven atrophy strongly correlates with observed neurodegeneration. Furthermore, by integrating the disease progression model with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulations, we present a powerful tool that facilitates regional evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting A{beta}, identification of critical intervention windows, and prediction of heterogeneous treatment effects across brain regions. This framework unifies mechanistic understanding with clinical imaging biomarkers, offering a quantitative approach for forecasting disease progression, testing mechanistic hypotheses, and optimising personalised treatment strategies in AD.

Here, each brain region is modeled by 2 oscillator clusters—a cluster of low-frequency (LFO) and high-frequency Hopf oscillators (HFO) coupled with an innovative power-coupling rule, facilitating cross-frequency interactions. The model is trained in 2 stages: learning oscillators’ frequencies and phase relations using a biologically plausible complex-Hebbian rule in the first stage and, followed by a modified complex backpropagation for amplitude approximation, overcoming limitations of poor accuracy and computational complexity in existing models. This framework outperforms current methods in replicating empirical functional connectivity (FC), FC dynamics (FCD), and modularity over disparate spatio-temporal scales. The correlation between the FC of fMRI and the FCs of various EEG frequency bands is reflected in the strengths of the LFO–HFO coupling. Furthermore, in silico structural perturbation studies quantified the effect of pruning of the anatomical connectivity on spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of FC, FCD, modularity, and integration level integrated state of occurrence rate. The model’s ability to reconstruct simultaneous EEG-fMRI data showcases significant advancement in understanding the resting-state brain’s functionality from multimodal settings and deciphering neurological disorders in diverse spatiotemporal scales.</span>

                Introduction Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is the second most frequent manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), predominantly characterised by mononuclear (MN) cells in pleural fluid. However, approximately 6.7% of cases show polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell predominance in pleural fluid, often causing delayed diagnosis and treatment, as these cases may not be initially recognised as tuberculosis. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of PMN- and MN-predominant TPE. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB with pleural effusion at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. Primary data were collected from patient interviews, physical examinations, and pleural fluid analysis of thoracentesis samples. The diagnosis of pleural effusion was confirmed by radiological imaging and thoracentesis. Patients were classified as PMN-predominant (≥50% PMN) or MN-predominant (≥50% MN) based on pleural fluid cell counts. Results Among the patients, 24 (40%) had PMN-predominant and 36 (60%) had MN-predominant pleural effusion. Significant differences were found between cell predominance and clinical features, including weight loss (p < 0.001), symptom duration (p = 0.034), clinical severity (p = 0.033), pleural fluid leukocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p < 0.001). PMN predominance was associated with severe clinical presentation and higher pleural leukocyte and LDH levels in pleural fluid than MN predominance. Conclusions PMN-predominant TPE reflects an early, more severe inflammatory phase characterised by severe clinical manifestations and elevated leukocyte and LDH levels. While MN predominance suggests a more chronic disease phase with longer symptoms and mild to moderate clinical presentation.

                Background Oral health is closely linked to well-being at work; however, evidence in hospital personnel remains limited. Methods Cross-sectional study in a Level II-1 hospital (n = 72). Oral-health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) was measured with OHIP-14 and perceived oral health (POH) with a modified HU-DBI. Bivariate associations were estimated with Spearman’s ρ and 95% confidence intervals; domain-level relationships were examined with proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2). Results OHRQoL was distributed as 38.9% Excellent, 26.4% Fair and 34.7% Poor; POH concentrated in the Low level (52.8%), followed by Excellent (29.2%) and Fair (18.1%). POH correlated positively with OHRQoL (ρ = 0.391; 95% CI 0.18–0.57; p = 0.001). Domain-level analyses showed the strongest links for psychological discomfort (ρ = 0.421; p < 0.001; pseudo-R2 = 0.111; p = 0.027) and physical disability (ρ = 0.319; p = 0.006; pseudo-R2 = 0.167; p = 0.004); social disability (ρ = 0.242; p = 0.040; pseudo-R2 = 0.124; p = 0.017) and handicap (ρ = 0.298; p = 0.011; pseudo-R2 = 0.131; p = 0.013) were smaller but significant, whereas functional limitation was non-significant (ρ = 0.096; p = 0.424; pseudo-R2 = 0.014; p = 0.6). Conclusions Better perceived oral health is significantly associated with higher oral-health-related quality of life among hospital staff. Consequently, targeted workplace strategies, including education for self-care, pain management, and functional support, could enhance oral well-being. Moreover, open instruments and pilot reliability outputs are available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Quantifying cell morphology is central to understanding cellular regulation, fate, and heterogeneity, yet conventional image-based analyses often struggle with diverse or irregular shapes. We present a computational framework that uses topological data analysis to characterise and compare single-cell morphologies from fluorescence microscopy. Each cell is represented by its contour together with the position of its nucleus, from which we construct a filtration based on a radial distance function and derive a persistence diagram encoding the shape’s topological evolution. The similarity between two cells is quantified using the 2-Wasserstein distance between their diagrams, yielding a shape distance we call the PH distance. We apply this method to two representative experimental systems—primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and HeLa cells—and show that PH distances enable the detection of outliers in those systems, the identification of sub-populations, and the quantification of shape heterogeneity. We benchmark PH against three established contour-based distances (aspect ratio, Fourier descriptors, and elastic shape analysis) and show that PH offers better separation between cell types and greater robustness when clustering heterogeneous populations. Together, these results demonstrate that persistent-homology-based signatures provide a principled and sensitive approach for analysing cell morphology in settings where traditional geometric or image-based descriptors are insufficient.

This study aims to quantify environmental health impacts and assess risk by understanding the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases, specifically Influenza-like Illness (ILI), across regions with varying socio-economic characteristics. We introduce a novel vulnerability-based approach to better understand the complex relationship between socio-economic factors and ILI burden. We developed a machine-learning-driven framework to assess and map state-level socio-economic vulnerability to ILI in the United States. A vulnerability index was created by integrating 39 diverse socio-economic and health indicators from the latest CENSUS. A Random Forest Regression model then weighed these indicators to quantify each state’s vulnerability for the ILI values in 2022. To assess multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated, and parameters were filtered to reduce the VIF. Key determinants of vulnerability include migration patterns, insurance coverage, and proportions of female and elderly populations. The resulting state-level vulnerability map reveals significant regional disparities. District of Columbia was identified as the most vulnerable state, followed by Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Rhode Island, all with normalized vulnerability indices exceeding 0.35. Our findings highlight significant regional variations in ILI vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions tailored to state-specific socio-economic conditions. This scalable and adaptable methodology extends beyond influenza, offering a valuable approach for assessing vulnerability to a wide range of infectious diseases, strengthening epidemic preparedness and response.

                Abstract* Background Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis currently relies on behavioral assessments, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This study investigates whether minimal EEG band measurements can differentiate individuals with ASD from neurotypical peers, providing a potential rapid screening tool. Methods A proof-of-concept study was conducted with twelve participants aged 10 to 20 years, including five neurotypical controls and seven ASD residents from the Arabic Village for Special Education Centre. Brain activity was recorded using four-sensor Muse 2 headband covering the temporal and front regions. The primary EEG frequency bands- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Theta- were measured and statically analysed for each participant. Results The EEG signals from the temporal regions were the most informative for distinguishing between groups. Specifically, gamma activity at the right temporal sensor (TP10) and beta activity at the left temporal (TP9) demonstrated the highest capacity to differentiate ASD individuals from controls. Conclusion These preliminary findings suggest that brief, simple EEG measurements, focusing on specific frequency bands in temporal regions, could rapid screening or monitoring of ASD behaviour in clinical and educational settings. Future research with larger samples and enhanced data collection is necessary to validate and expand upon these results.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The optimal treatment for distal medium vessel occlusion (DMVO) stroke remains uncertain, and evidence comparing endovascular therapy (EVT) with medical management (MM) is limited. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive modeling tool to assess individual treatment benefit in DMVO stroke using explainable counterfactual treatment estimation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adults with isolated DMVO stroke (M3–M4, A2–A3, or P1–P2) were retrospectively identified from 7 stroke centers. To estimate individualized probabilities of favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–2 at 90 days), we developed a Penalized Logistic Regression (Elastic Net) model. This framework was selected a priori over other explored machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost) for its superior interpretability and ability to handle multicollinearity among interaction terms. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) was implemented to address confounding by indication in the observational data. Internal validation used repeated K-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping; external validation was performed on an independent cohort (n = 86).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 321 eligible patients, 179 received EVT (55.8%) and 142 received MM (44.2%). Adjusted models showed no significant overall group differences in favorable outcome (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97–1.80), mortality (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.78–1.85), or symptomatic hemorrhage (aOR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.21–1.58). However, the model identified significant treatment effect heterogeneity; EVT benefit was amplified in patients with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and attenuated with increasing treatment delay. Internal validation demonstrated strong performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.71–0.82). External validation confirmed generalizability (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63–0.84). Individualized treatment estimates showed high concordance with a benchmark causal T-Learner model (Pearson <i>r</i> = 0.97 internal and <i>r</i> = 0.98 external).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although aggregate outcomes did not differ significantly, the validated Distal and Medium Vessel Occlusion Stroke (DUSK) Tool enables individualized estimation of EVT benefit in DMVO stroke. This explainable counterfactual treatment estimation framework supports precision decision making by identifying specific patient subgroups most likely to benefit from EVT over MM.

                Background Innovation in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) often stems from CEO traits and leadership. While prior research highlights the role of executive traits in innovation, less is known about the mechanisms through which these traits translate into firm-level innovation capabilities in emerging-economy MSMEs. Methods Grounded in Upper Echelons Theory, the HEXACO personality framework, and transformational leadership theory, this study tests a sequential mediation model using data from 106 CEOs of Colombian MSMEs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine whether transformational leadership and innovative behavior mediate the relationship between CEO personality traits (Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness) and organizational innovation capabilities. Results The model showed good fit (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.07). Openness and Conscientiousness significantly predicted transformational leadership, which in turn promoted innovative behavior. Innovative behavior subsequently enhanced firms’ innovation capabilities, confirming (through bootstrapped indirect effects) mediation from CEO traits to innovation capabilities through transformational leadership and innovative behavior. Conclusions The findings indicate that CEO personality and leadership are key to indirectly fostering innovation in resource-constrained MSMEs. The findings extend upper-echelons theory and suggest leadership development is key to improving innovation performance in emerging-economy MSMEs.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping various aspects of human life, including healthcare. In the Western world, AI is increasingly applied in education and clinical practice through algorithms designed to analyze health data, aid in prediction, and assist with disease diagnosis. However, developing countries like India face obstacles in adopting AI due to limited resources and socio-cultural factors. Aim This study seeks to assess and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to AI in dentistry among undergraduate and postgraduate students in South India. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional online survey was conducted among dental students in South India. The survey included 21 validated, structured, close-ended questions addressing demographic details, self-assessment of knowledge, attitudes toward AI applications in dentistry, and self-perceived understanding of AI practice in the field. Results Of 208 respondents (81.8% response rate), 95.6% were familiar with the term AI. Postgraduates demonstrated significantly greater awareness of AI applications (90.9%) compared to undergraduates (25.8%). About 78.3% of undergraduates believed AI supports diagnosis and treatment planning, while 33.4% of undergraduates and 43.2% of postgraduates expressed concern that AI may replace dentists in the future. Most respondents acknowledged AI’s role in oral radiology (UG: 79.1%; PG: 72.2%). Interest in future learning was high (UG: 82.5%; PG: 92.2%). Level of education was a significant predictor of knowledge (p<0.01), while male students showed more positive attitudes (p<0.01). First-year postgraduates reported better AI-related practices than other groups (p<0.01). Conclusion Although most dental students lacked sufficient knowledge regarding the use of AI in dentistry, they displayed positive and encouraging attitudes toward its application. A large proportion expressed willingness to learn AI technologies to apply them in clinical practice. It is therefore recommended that universities and government bodies work together to integrate AI related topics into the dental curriculum to strengthen dental education in India.

<p>BMSCs regulated the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis through peripheral blood vessels and improved cognitive dysfunction induced by CCI in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Recent evidence has shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have multiple biological applications and play an important role in improving cognitive dysfunction. However, it is still unclear whether BMSCs play a role in cognitive impairment induced by chronic pain. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of BMSCs on neuropathic pain-induced cognitive dysfunction and explore its potential mechanisms. A mouse chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was established, and the new object recognition task and fear conditioning were used to detect cognitive function; the expression of CXCL12/CXCR4 in blood and hippocampus was detected. After intravenous injection of BMSCs, changes in cognitive function and expression of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway, dentate gyrus neurogenesis, and excitability of hippocampal neurons were detected. In addition, induction of cognitive impairment in normal mice by CXCL12 recombinant protein was used to clarify whether the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway mediates the cognitive function improvement effect of BMSCs. Our results found CCI mice showed significant cognitive impairment 21 days after surgery, with significantly increased expression of CXCL12/CXCR4 in blood and hippocampus. Intravenous injection of BMSCs significantly improved cognitive function, inhibited expression of CXCL12/CXCR4 in blood and hippocampus, promoted neurogenesis in dentate gyrus of CCI mice, and increased expression of BDNF and c-Fos in the hippocampus. In addition, BMSCs alleviate cognitive impairment induced by intravenous injection of CXCL12 recombinant protein in mice. In summary, BMSCs improve chronic neuropathic pain-induced cognitive dysfunction through peripheral blood CXCL12/CXCR4, and BMSCs may develop into therapeutic targets for chronic pain induced cognitive impairment.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f5dee048-043d-44ff-a66e-2b2da1e71afb/cne70133-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Core and Matrix Thalamopallial Projections in Birds: A Study in the Pigeon (Columba livia)"/>
<p>Fernández et al. describe two novel aspects of thalamopallial organization in birds: (1) the existence of a matrix-like system of projections originating from a population of dorsal thalamic neurons that are distributed between sensory nuclei. These projections target the intermediate and dorsal layers, but not the senso-recipient layers of the sensory pallium; and (2) the presence of a reciprocal connection between the core thalamic sensory nuclei and the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus. Notably, both features closely parallel key aspects of the thalamocortical projection system in mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ascending sensory projections from the dorsal thalamus to the pallium are one of the most distinctive features of the amniote brain. In mammals, these projections can be broadly classified into two main types: (1) those arising from “core” neurons, mostly located in the central region of sensory nuclei, which relay topographic inputs to the intermediate layers of primary sensory cortices, forming a reciprocal circuit with the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN); and (2) those originating from “matrix” neurons, located in the periphery of sensory nuclei, which project to superficial layers of primary and higher order cortices. To date, both the reciprocal core-RTN circuitry and the matrix projections have only been described in mammals. In this study, we re-examined the organization of thalamic projections to the visual dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) in pigeons using neural tracing techniques. In addition to the well-known projection from the thalamic nucleus rotundus (Rt) to the ventral layer of the visual DVR (entopallium), we described a reciprocal projection pattern between the Rt and the RTN. Moreover, we identified a second ascending thalamopallial projection, arising from neurons surrounding the Rt and terminating primarily in the intermediate layer of the visual DVR. These neurons form a continuous “matrix” of cells within the dorsal thalamus, which as a group also give rise to axons targeting several associative pallial areas. Furthermore, we found that this “matrix” region receives descending inputs from the motor arcopallium. Collectively, these findings indicate that the avian thalamopallial system is more complex than previously recognized and thus more comparable to its mammalian counterpart.</p>
